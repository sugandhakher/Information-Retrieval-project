solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity  either directly using photovoltaics  pv   or indirectly using concentrated solar power  concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect  1 
the international energy agency projected in 2014 that under its  high renewables  scenario  by 2050  solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent  respectively  of the worldwide electricity consumption  and solar would be the world s largest source of electricity  most solar installations would be in china and india  2 
photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications  from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop pv system  as the cost of solar electricity has fallen  the number of grid-connected solar pv systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built  solar pv is rapidly becoming an inexpensive  low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the sun  the current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the 850mw longyangxia dam solar park  in qinghai  china 
commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s  the 392mw ivanpah installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world  located in the mojave desert of california

mainstream technologies edit 
many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to conventional energy sources while an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive imported fuels  see solar power by country   long distance transmission allows remote renewable energy resources to displace fossil fuel consumption  solar power plants use one of two technologies 
photovoltaic  pv  systems use solar panels  either on rooftops or in ground-mounted solar farms  converting sunlight directly into electric power 
concentrated solar power  csp  also known as  concentrated solar thermal   plants use solar thermal energy to make steam  that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine 
photovoltaics edit 
main article  photovoltaics
schematics of a grid-connected residential pv power system 3 
a solar cell  or photovoltaic cell  pv   is a device that converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect  the first solar cell was constructed by charles fritts in the 1880s  4  the german industrialist ernst werner von siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery  5  in 1931  the german engineer bruno lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide  6  although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1  of incident light into electricity  following the work of russell ohl in the 1940s  researchers gerald pearson  calvin fuller and daryl chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954  7  these early solar cells cost 286usd watt and reached efficiencies of 4.56   8 
conventional pv systems edit 
the array of a photovoltaic power system  or pv system  produces direct current  dc  power which fluctuates with the sunlight s intensity  for practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current  ac   through the use of inverters  3  multiple solar cells are connected inside modules  modules are wired together to form arrays  then tied to an inverter  which produces power at the desired voltage  and for ac  the desired frequency phase  3 
many residential pv systems are connected to the grid wherever available  especially in developed countries with large markets  9  in these grid-connected pv systems  use of energy storage is optional  in certain applications such as satellites  lighthouses  or in developing countries  batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups  such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight 
concentrated solar power edit 
main article  concentrated solar power
a parabolic collector concentrates sunlight onto a tube in its focal point 
concentrated solar power  csp   also called  concentrated solar thermal   uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  contrary to photovoltaics  which converts light directly into electricity  csp uses the heat of the sun s radiation to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines 
a wide range of concentrating technologies exists  among the best known are the parabolic trough  the compact linear fresnel reflector  the stirling dish and the solar power tower  various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light  in all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight  and is then used for power generation or energy storage  10  thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation  11 
a parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector s focal line  the receiver is a tube positioned right above the middle of the parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid  the reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis  parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology  12  the segs plants in california and acciona s nevada solar one near boulder city  nevada are representatives of this technology  13  14 
compact linear fresnel reflectors are csp-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid  this has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors  and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space  allowing more of the available sunlight to be used  concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants  15  16 
the stirling solar dish combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a stirling engine which normally drives an electric generator  the advantages of stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime  parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among csp technologies  17  the 50kw big dish in canberra  australia is an example of this technology  13 
a solar power tower uses an array of tracking reflectors  heliostats  to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower  power towers are more cost effective  offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among csp technologies  13  the ps10 solar power plant and ps20 solar power plant are examples of this technology 
hybrid systems edit 
a hybrid system combines  c pv and csp with one another or with other forms of generation such as diesel  wind and biogas  the combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel  hybrid systems are most often found on islands 
cpv csp system
a novel solar cpv csp hybrid system has been proposed  combining concentrator photovoltaics with the non-pv technology of concentrated solar power  or also known as concentrated solar thermal  18 
iscc system
the hassi r mel power station in algeria  is an example of combining csp with a gas turbine  where a 25-megawatt csp-parabolic trough array supplements a much larger 130mw combined cycle gas turbine plant  another example is the yazd power station in iran 
pvt system
hybrid pv t   also known as photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy  such a system combines a solar  pv  module with a solar thermal collector in an complementary way 
cpvt system
a concentrated photovoltaic thermal hybrid  cpvt  system is similar to a pvt system  it uses concentrated photovoltaics  cpv  instead of conventional pv technology  and combines it with a solar thermal collector 
pv diesel system
it combines a photovoltaic system with a diesel generator  19  combinations with other renewables are possible and include wind turbines  20 
pv-thermoelectric system
thermoelectric  or  thermovoltaic  devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current  solar cells use only the high frequency part of the radiation  while the low frequency heat energy is wasted  several patents about the use of thermoelectric devices in tandem with solar cells have been filed  21  the idea is to increase the efficiency of the combined solar thermoelectric system to convert the solar radiation into useful electricity

early days edit 
the early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce  however  development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury in the face of the increasing availability  economy  and utility of coal and petroleum  26  in 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of north america were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems  27  the 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies  28  29  deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the federal photovoltaic utilization program in the us and the sunshine program in japan  other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the united states  seri  now nrel   japan  nedo   and germany  fraunhoferise   30  between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly  but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from 1984 to 1996 
mid-1990s to early 2010s edit 
in the mid-1990s  development of both  residential and commercial rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations  began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas  global warming concerns  and the improving economic position of pv relative to other energy technologies  31  in the early 2000s  the adoption of feed-in tariffsa policy mechanism  that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricitylead to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of pv deployments in europe 
current status edit 
further information  growth of photovoltaics
for several years  worldwide growth of solar pv was driven by european deployment  but has since shifted to asia  especially china and japan  and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world  including  but not limited to  australia  canada  chile  india  israel  mexico  south africa  south korea  thailand  and the united states 
worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40  per year since 2000 and total installed capacity reached 139gw at the end of 2013 with germany having the most cumulative installations  35.7gw  and italy having the highest percentage of electricity generated by solar pv  7.0    32 
concentrated solar power  csp  also started to grow rapidly  increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013  albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar pv  33  51 as of the end of 2013  worldwide cumulative csp-capacity reached 3,425mw 
forecasts edit 
in 2010  the international energy agency predicted that global solar pv capacity could reach 3,000 gw or 11  of projected global electricity generation by 2050enough to generate 4,500twh of electricity  34  four years later  in 2014  the agency projected that  under its  high renewables  scenario  solar power could supply 27  of global electricity generation by 2050  16  from pv and 11  from csp   2  in 2015  analysts predicted that one million homes in the u s  will have solar power by the end of 2016  35

swanson s law  the pv learning curve
solar pv  lcoe for europe until 2020  in euro-cts  per kwh  44 
economic photovoltaic capacity vs installation cost  in the united states
adjusting for inflation  it cost  96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s  process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down to 68 cents per watt in february 2016  according to data from bloomberg new energy finance  45  palo alto california signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour  and in sunny dubai large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just 2.99 cents per kilowatt-hour --  competitive with any form of fossil-based electricity  and cheaper than most   46 
photovoltaic systems use no fuel  and modules typically last 25 to 40 years  thus  capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power  operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the us are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity  and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity  47  governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power  such as feed-in tariff programs  also  renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs  in most states  rps goals can be achieved by any combination of solar  wind  biomass  landfill gas  ocean  geothermal  municipal solid waste  hydroelectric  hydrogen  or fuel cell technologies  48 
levelized cost of electricity edit 
the pv industry is beginning to adopt levelized cost of electricity  lcoe  as the unit of cost  the electrical energy generated is sold in units of kilowatt-hours  kwh   as a rule of thumb  and depending on the local insolation  1 watt-peak of installed solar pv capacity generates about 1 to 2kwh of electricity per year  this corresponds to a capacity factor of around 1020   the product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power  the international conference on solar photovoltaic investments  organized by epia  has estimated that pv systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years  49  as a result  since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term power purchase agreement  fifty percent of commercial systems in the united states were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90  by 2009  50 
shi zhengrong has said that  as of 2012  unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in india  hawaii  italy and spain  he said  we are at a tipping point  no longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich  they are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies    solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015   51 
current installation prices edit 
in its 2014 edition of the technology roadmap  solar photovoltaic energy report  the international energy agency  iea  published prices for residential  commercial and utility-scale pv systems for eight major markets as of 2013  see table below   2  however  doe s sunshot initiative has reported much lower u s  installation prices  in 2014  prices continued to decline  the sunshot initiative modeled u s  system prices to be in the range of  1.80 to  3.29 per watt  52  other sources identify similar price ranges of  1.70 to  3.50 for the different market segments in the u s   53  and in the highly penetrated german market  prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kw declined to  1.36 per watt  1.24 w  by the end of 2014  54  in 2015  deutsche bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the u s  around  2.90 per watt  costs for utility-scale systems in china and india were estimated as low as  1.00 per watt  55

1u s figures are lower in doe s photovoltaic system pricing trends 52 
grid parity edit 
main article  grid parity
grid parity  the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power  is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in california and japan  56  in 2008  the levelized cost of electricity for solar pv was  0.25 kwh or less in most of the oecd countries  by late 2011  the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below  0.15 kwh for most of the oecd and to reach  0.10 kwh in sunnier regions  these cost levels are driving three emerging trends  vertical integration of the supply chain  origination of power purchase agreements  ppas  by solar power companies  and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies  grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers  57  dead link 
grid parity was first reached in spain in 2013  58  hawaii and other islands that otherwise use fossil fuel  diesel fuel  to produce electricity  and most of the us is expected to reach grid parity by 2015  59  not in citation given  60  not in citation given 
in 2007  general electric s chief engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the united states by around 2015  other companies predicted an earlier date  61  the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10  of commercial customers in the oecd  as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010  57 
self consumption edit 
in cases of self consumption of the solar energy  the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid  for example  in germany  with electricity prices of 0.25 euro kwh and insolation of 900 kwh kw  one kwp will save 225 euro per year  and with an installation cost of 1700 euro kwp the system cost will be returned in less than 7 years  62  however  in many cases  the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide  and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid  the electricity is sold  and at other times when energy is taken from the grid  electricity is bought  the relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics 
energy pricing and incentives edit 
main article  pv financial incentives
the political purpose of incentive policies for pv is to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry  even where the cost of pv is significantly above grid parity  to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity  the policies are implemented to promote national energy independence  high tech job creation and reduction of co2 emissions  three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies  the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system  the electricity utility buys pv electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate     and solar renewable energy certificates  srecs 
rebates edit 
with investment subsidies  the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer  while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities  customer bases  while the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer  the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality  investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time  thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance  some electric companies offer rebates to their customers  such as austin energy in texas  which offers  2.50 watt installed up to  15,000  63 
net metering edit 
net metering  unlike a feed-in tariff  requires only one meter  but it must be bi-directional 
in net metering the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer  and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption  net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters  which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference  and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption  effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery  with net metering  deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month  best practices call for perpetual roll over of kwh credits  64  excess credits upon termination of service are either lost  or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above  as can be excess annual credits  in new jersey  annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate  as are left over credits when a customer terminates service  65 
feed-in tariffs  fit  edit 
with feed-in tariffs  the financial burden falls upon the consumer  they reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time  but because the rate is set by the authorities  it may result in perceived overpayment  the price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity  net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged 
the complexity of approvals in california  spain and italy has prevented comparable growth to germany even though the return on investment is better  citation needed  in some countries  additional incentives are offered for bipv compared to stand alone pv 
france   eur 0.16  kwh  compared to semi-integrated  or   eur 0.27 kwh  compared to stand alone 
italy   eur 0.04-0.09 kwh
germany   eur 0.05 kwh  facades only 
solar renewable energy credits  srecs  edit 
alternatively  srecs allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsity  in this mechanism  a renewable energy production or consumption target is set  and the utility  more technically the load serving entity  is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine  alternative compliance payment or acp   the producer is credited for an srec for every 1,000kwh of electricity produced  if the utility buys this srec and retires it  they avoid paying the acp  in principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy  since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations  uncertainties about the future value of srecs have led to long-term srec contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits 
financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries  including australia  china  66  germany  67  israel  68  japan  and the united states and even across states within the us 
the japanese government through its ministry of international trade and industry ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003  by the end of 2004  japan led the world in installed pv capacity with over 1.1gw  69 
in 2004  the german government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system  under the german renewable energy act  which resulted in explosive growth of pv installations in germany  at the outset the fit was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price  the principle behind the german system is a 20-year flat rate contract  the value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year  in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users  the programme has been more successful than expected with over 1gw installed in 2006  and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers 
subsequently  spain  italy  greecethat enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needsand france introduced feed-in tariffs  none have replicated the programmed decrease of fit in new contracts though  making the german incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries  the french and greek fit offer a high premium  eur 0.55 kwh  for building integrated systems  california  greece  france and italy have 30-50  more insolation than germany making them financially more attractive  the greek domestic  solar roof  programme  adopted in june 2009 for installations up to 10kw  has internal rates of return of 10-15  at current commercial installation costs  which  furthermore  is tax free 
in 2006 california approved the  california solar initiative   offering a choice of investment subsidies or fit for small and medium systems and a fit for large systems  the small-system fit of  0.39 per kwh  far less than eu countries  expires in just 5 years  and the alternate  epbb  residential investment incentive is modest  averaging perhaps 20  of cost  all california incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of pv capacity installed 
at the end of 2006  the ontario power authority  opa  canada  began its standard offer program  a precursor to the green energy act  and the first in north america for distributed renewable projects of less than 10mw  the feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of  0.42 cdn per kwh over a period of twenty years  unlike net metering  all the electricity produced was sold to the opa at the given rate 
environmental impacts edit 
part of the senftenberg solarpark  a solar photovoltaic power plant located on former open-pit mining areas close to the city of senftenberg  in eastern germany  the 78 mw phase 1 of the plant was completed within three months 
unlike fossil fuel based technologies  solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation  but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution 
greenhouse gases edit 
the life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of solar power are in the range of 22 to 46gram  g  per kilowatt-hour  kwh  depending on if solar thermal or solar pv is being analyzed  respectively  with this potentially being decreased to 15g kwh in the future  70  for comparison  of weighted averages   a combined cycle gas-fired power plant emits some 400599g kwh  71  an oil-fired power plant 893g kwh  71  a coal-fired power plant 915994g kwh 72  or with carbon capture and storage some 200g kwh  and a geothermal high-temp  power plant 91122g kwh  71  the life cycle emission intensity of hydro  wind and nuclear power are lower than solar s as of 2011 as published by the ipcc  and discussed in the article life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources  similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase  the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions  bp solar owns two factories built by solarex  one in maryland  the other in virginia  in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels  a 1-kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal  300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere  and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly  73 
the us national renewable energy laboratory  nrel   in harmonizing the disparate estimates of life-cycle ghg emissions for solar pv  found that the most critical parameter was the solar insolation of the site  ghg emissions factors for pv solar are inversely proportional to insolation  74  for a site with insolation of 1700 kwh m2 year  typical of southern europe  nrel researchers estimated ghg emissions of 45gco2e kwh  using the same assumptions  at phoenix  usa  with insolation of 2400kwh m2 year  the ghg emissions factor would be reduced to 32g of co2e kwh  75 
the new zealand parliamentary commissioner for the environment found that the solar pv would have little impact on the country s greenhouse gas emissions  the country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources  primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal  and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons  meaning a large uptake of solar pv would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants  76 
energy payback edit 
the energy payback time  epbt  of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system  due to improving production technologies the payback time has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of pv systems in the energy market  77  in 2000 the energy payback time of pv systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years 78  and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for crystalline silicon silicon pv systems 70  and 11.5 years for thin film technologies  s  europe   70  these figures fell to 0.753.5 years in 2013  with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon pv and cis systems  79 
another economic measure  closely related to the energy payback time  is the energy returned on energy invested  eroei  or energy return on investment  eroi   80  which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment   this is not the same as the economic return on investment  roi   which varies according to local energy prices  subsidies available and metering techniques   with expected lifetimes of 30 years  81  the eroei of pv systems are in the range of 10 to 30  thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times  6-31 reproductions  depending on what type of material  balance of system  bos   and the geographic location of the system  82 
other issues edit 
one issue that has often raised concerns is the use of cadmium  cd   a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains  it is used as semiconductor component in cdte solar cells and as buffer layer for certain cigs cells in the form of cds  83  the amount of cadmium used in thin-film pv modules is relatively small  510 g m  and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero  current pv technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.30.9 microgram kwh over the whole life-cycle  70  most of these emissions actually arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules  and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium  life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram kwh  lignite 6.2  and natural gas 0.2 microgram kwh 
in a life-cycle analysis it has been noted  that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal  cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated  84 
in the case of crystalline silicon modules  the solder material  that joins together the copper strings of the cells  contains about 36 percent of lead  pb   moreover  the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of pb and sometimes cd as well  it is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of pb have been used for 100 gigawatts of c-si solar modules  however  there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy  83 
some media sources have reported that concentrated solar power plants have injured or killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat from the concentrated sunrays  85  86  this adverse effect does not apply to pv solar power plants  and some of the claims may have been overstated or exaggerated  87 
a 2014-published life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that the large-scale implementation of solar and wind potentially reduces pollution-related environmental impacts  the study found that the land-use footprint  given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour  m2a mwh   was lowest for wind  natural gas and rooftop pv  with 0.26  0.49 and 0.59  respectively  and followed by utility-scale solar pv with 7.9  for csp  the footprint was 9 and 14  using parabolic troughs and solar towers  respectively  the largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18m2a mwh  88 
emerging technologies edit 
concentrator photovoltaics edit 
cpv modules on dual axis solar trackers in golmud  china
concentrator photovoltaics  cpv  systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electrical power production  contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems  it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small  but highly efficient  multi-junction solar cells  solar concentrators of all varieties may be used  and these are often mounted on a solar tracker in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky  89  luminescent solar concentrators  when combined with a pv-solar cell  can also be regarded as a cpv system  concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of pv-solar panels drastically  90 
in addition  most solar panels on spacecraft are also made of high efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in the inner solar system 
floatovoltaics edit 
floatovoltaics are an emerging form of pv systems that float on the surface of irrigation canals  water reservoirs  quarry lakes  and tailing ponds  several systems exist in france  india  japan  korea  the united kingdom and the united states  91  92  93  94  these systems reduce the need of valuable land area  save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation  and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion  as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land  95 
grid integration edit 
main articles  energy storage and grid energy storage
construction of the salt tanks which provide efficient thermal energy storage 96  so that output can be provided after the sun goes down  and output can be scheduled to meet demand requirements  97  the 280 mw solana generating station is designed to provide six hours of energy storage  this allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year  98 
thermal energy storage  the andasol csp plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy 
pumped-storage hydroelectricity  psh   this facility in geesthacht  germany  also includes a solar array 
since solar energy is not available at night  storing its energy is an important issue in order to have continuous energy availability  99  both wind power and solar power are variable renewable energy  meaning that all available output must be taken when it is available  and either stored for when it can be used later  or transported over transmission lines to where it can be used now  concentrated solar power plants may use thermal energy storage to store the solar energy  such as in high-temperature molten salts  these salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost  have a high specific heat capacity  and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems  this method of energy storage is used  for example  by the solar two power station  allowing it to store 1.44tj in its 68m storage tank  enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours  with an efficiency of about 99   100 
rechargeable batteries have been traditionally used to store excess electricity in stand alone pv systems  with grid-connected photovoltaic power system  excess electricity can be sent to the electrical grid  net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce  this credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand  effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity  credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually  101  when wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power  other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately  but as these forms of variable power grow  additional balance on the grid is needed  as prices are rapidly declining  pv systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night  batteries used for grid-storage stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads usually for several minutes  and in rare cases for hours  in the future  less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid  as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation 
although not permitted under the us national electric code  it is technically possible to have a plug and play pv microinverter  a recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical  though not all safety requirements   102 
common battery technologies used in today s home pv systems include  the valve regulated lead-acid battery a modified version of the conventional leadacid battery  nickelcadmium and lithium-ion batteries  lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale  residential pv systems  due to their high reliability  low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs  despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density  however  lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future  as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the gigafactory 1  in addition  the li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system  since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time  their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back  other rechargeable batteries used for distributed pv systems include  sodiumsulfur and vanadium redox batteries  two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery  respectively  103  104  105 
conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with variable electricity sources such as solar and wind  the water can be held back and allowed to flow as required  where a suitable river is not available  pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when surplus electricity is available  from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one  the energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water through a hydroelectric power generator  106  however  this cycle can lose 20  of the energy to round trip inefficiencies 
the combination of wind and solar pv has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year  the power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems  20  solar power is seasonal  particularly in northern southern climates  away from the equator  suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric  107  the institute for solar energy supply technology of the university of kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar  wind  biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources  108 
research is also undertaken in this field of artificial photosynthesis  it involves the use of nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds  by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol  many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture  quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions  109  senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues  110
