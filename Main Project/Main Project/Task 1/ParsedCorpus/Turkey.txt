turkey  i trki   turkish  trkiye  tycije    officially the republic of turkey  turkish  trkiye cumhuriyeti helpinfo   pronounced tycije dumhuijeti    is a transcontinental parliamentary republic in eurasia  mainly on the anatolian peninsula in western asia  with a smaller portion on the balkan peninsula in southeast europe  7  turkey is a democratic  secular  unitary  constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage  8  9 
turkey is bordered by eight countries  greece to the west  bulgaria to the northwest  georgia to the northeast  armenia  the azerbaijani exclave of nakhchivan and iran to the east  and iraq and syria to the south  the aegean sea is to the west  the black sea to the north  and the mediterranean sea to the south  the bosphorus  the sea of marmara  and the dardanelles  which together form the turkish straits  divide thrace and anatolia  they also separate europe and asia  10  turkey s location between europe and asia has retained its geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history  11  12 
turkey has been inhabited since the paleolithic 13  by various ancient anatolian civilizations  as well as assyrians  greeks  thracians  phrygians  urartians and armenians  14  15  16  after alexander the great s conquest  the area was hellenized  a process which continued under the roman empire and its transition into the byzantine empire  15  17  the seljuk turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century  starting the process of turkification  which was accelerated by the seljuk victory over the byzantines at the battle of manzikert in 1071  18  the seljuk sultanate of rm ruled anatolia until the mongol invasion in 1243  when it disintegrated into small turkish beyliks  19 
in the mid-14th century the ottomans started uniting anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of southeastern europe  western asia and north africa  becoming a major power in eurasia and africa during the early modern period  the empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century  especially during the reign  15201566  of suleiman the magnificent  the empire remained powerful and influential for two more centuries  until important setbacks such as the great turkish war  168399  and the russo-turkish war  176874  forced it to cede strategic territories in europe  signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth  the tanzimat reforms of the 19th century  which aimed to modernize the ottoman state  proved to be inadequate in most fields  and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire  20 
suspended by sultan abdlhamid ii in 1878  the ottoman constitution and parliament were restored with the young turk revolution on 24 july 1908  taking advantage of the chaos  bulgaria formally declared its independence on 5 october 1908  and austria-hungary formally annexed bosnia-herzegovina on 6 october 1908  the italo-turkish war  19111912  encouraged the balkan league to declare the balkan wars  19121913   which caused the ottoman empire to lose the majority of its remaining territories in europe and triggered the largest ethnic cleansing of turks in the balkan peninsula since the russo-turkish war  187778   resulting in the mass migrations of turks to anatolia  the disappointment in these losses led to the 1913 ottoman coup d tat which effectively put the country under the control of the three pashas  who decided to join the central powers of world war i  19141918  which were ultimately defeated by the allied powers  during the war  the ottoman government committed ethnic cleansing or genocide against its armenian  assyrian and pontic greek citizens  21  following the war  the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the ottoman empire was divided into several new states  22 
the turkish war of independence  19191922   initiated by mustafa kemal atatrk and his colleagues in anatolia against the occupying allies  resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the modern republic of turkey in 1923  with atatrk as its first president  23 
turkey s official language is turkish  a turkic language spoken natively by 84.5  of the population  24  according to polls  between 78.1  and 81.3  of the country s citizens identify themselves as ethnic turks  24  other ethnic groups include legally recognized  armenians  greeks  jews  and unrecognized  kurds  circassians  arabs  albanians  bosniaks  georgians  etc   minorities  24  kurds are the largest ethnic minority group  making up approximately 13.4  24  to 18  8  or up to 25  25  of the population  based on polls and estimates  the vast majority of the population is nominally sunni muslim  with alevis making up the largest religious minority  8 
turkey is a charter member of the un  an early member of nato  and a founding member of the oecd  osce  oic and g-20  after becoming one of the first members of the council of europe in 1949  turkey became an associate member of the eec in 1963  applied for full eec membership in 1987  joined the eu customs union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the european union in 2005  26  turkey s growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power  27  28  29  30

the ottoman empire s power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries  particularly during the reign of suleiman the magnificent  who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society  education  taxation and criminal law  the empire was often at odds with the holy roman empire in its steady advance towards central europe through the balkans and the southern part of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth  67  at sea  the ottoman navy contended with several holy leagues  such as those in 1538  1571  1684 and 1717  composed primarily of habsburg spain  the republic of genoa  the republic of venice  the knights of st  john  the papal states  the grand duchy of tuscany and the duchy of savoy   for the control of the mediterranean sea  in the east  the ottomans were often at war with safavid persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries  68  the ottoman wars with persia continued as the zand  afsharid  and qajar dynasties succeeded the safavids in iran  until the first half of the 19th century  from the 16th to the early 20th centuries  the ottoman empire also fought many wars with the russian tsardom and empire  these were initially about the ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern europe  but starting from the latter half of the 18th century  they became more about the survival of the ottoman state  which began to lose its strategic territories on the northern black sea coast to the advancing russians  between the 18th and the early 20th centuries  the ottoman  persian and russian empires were neighbouring rivals of each other

from the second half of the 18th century onwards  the ottoman empire began to decline  the tanzimat reforms of the 19th century aimed to modernize the ottoman state in line with the progress that was made in the west  but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields  and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire  20  as it gradually shrank in size  military power and wealth  especially after the ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875 69  which led to uprisings in the balkan provinces that culminated into the russo-turkish war of 187778  many balkan muslims migrated to the empire s heartland in anatolia  70  71  along with the circassians fleeing the russian conquest of the caucasus  the decline of the ottoman empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among the various subject peoples  leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence  such as the hamidian massacres of armenians  72 
the young turk revolution in 1908 restored the ottoman constitution and parliament 30 years after their suspension by sultan abdlhamid ii in 1878  but the 1913 ottoman coup d tat effectively put the country under the control of the three pashas  this made sultans mehmed v and mehmed vi largely symbolic figureheads with no real political power

during the first six decades of the republic  between 1923 and 1983  turkey generally adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over foreign trade  flow of foreign currency  foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields  such as broadcasting  telecommunications  energy  mining  etc    however  in 1983  prime minister turgut zal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist  insulated system to a more private-sector  market-based model  100
