sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system in which the exchange of heat changes the temperature of the body or system  and some macroscopic variables of the body or system  but leaves unchanged certain other macroscopic variables of the body or system  such as volume or pressure  1  2  3  4

the term is used in contrast to a latent heat  which is the amount of heat exchanged that is hidden  meaning it occurs without change of temperature  for example  during a phase change such as the melting of ice  the temperature of the system containing the ice and the liquid is constant until all ice has melted  the terms latent and sensible are correlative  that means that they are defined as a pair  depending on which other macroscopic variables are held constant during the process 
the sensible heat of a thermodynamic process may be calculated as the product of the body s mass  m  with its specific heat capacity  c  and the change in temperature

joule described sensible heat as the energy measured by a thermometer
sensible heat and latent heat are not special forms of energy  rather  they describe exchanges of heat under conditions specified in terms of their effect on a material or a thermodynamic system 
in the writings of the early scientists who provided the foundations of thermodynamics  sensible heat had a clear meaning in calorimetry  james prescott joule characterized it in 1847 as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer  5 
both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes while transporting energy in nature  latent heat is associated with changes of state  measured at constant temperature  especially the phase changes of atmospheric water vapor  mostly vaporization and condensation  whereas sensible heat directly affects the temperature of the atmosphere 
in meteorology  the term  sensible heat flux  means the conductive heat flux from the earth s surface to the atmosphere  6  it is an important component of earth s surface energy budget  sensible heat flux is commonly measured with the eddy covariance method
