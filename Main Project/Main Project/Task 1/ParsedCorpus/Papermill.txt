history edit 
see also  history of paper
a mid-19th century paper mill  the forest fibre company  in berlin  new hampshire
historical investigations into the origin of the paper mill are complicated by differing definitions and loose terminology from modern authors  many modern scholars use the term to refer indiscriminately to all kinds of mills  whether powered by humans  by animals or by water  their propensity to refer to any ancient paper manufacturing centre as a  mill   without further specifying its exact power drive  has increased the difficulty of identifying the particularly efficient and historically important water-powered type  1 
human and animal-powered mills edit 
while the use of human and animal powered mills was known to chinese and muslim papermakers  evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive in both of them  2  3  4  5  the general absence of the use of water-power in muslim papermaking is suggested by the habit of muslim authors to call a production center not a  mill   but a  paper manufactory   6 
although scholars have identified  paper mills  in abbasid-era baghdad in 794795  the evidence that waterpower was applied to papermaking at this time is a matter of scholarly debate  7  in the moroccan city of fez  ibn battuta speaks of  400 mill stones for paper   8  since ibn battuta does not mention the use of water-power and such a number of water-mills would be grotesquely high  the passage is generally taken to refer to human or animal force  4  8 
water-powered mills edit 
dutch paper mill from 1654 in the arnhem open-air museum
stromer s paper mill  the building complex at the far right bottom  in the nuremberg chronicle of 1493  due to their noise and smell  papermills were required by medieval law to be erected some distance from the city walls 
an exhaustive survey of milling in al-andalus did not uncover a single water-powered paper mill  nor do the spanish books of property distribution  repartimientos  after the christian reconquest refer to any  9  arabic texts never use the term mill in connection with papermaking and the most thorough account of muslim papermaking  the one by the zirid sultan al-muizz ibn badis  describes the art purely in terms of a handcraft  9  donald hill has identified a possible reference to a water-powered paper mill in samarkand  in the 11th-century work of the persian scholar abu rayhan biruni  but concludes that the passage is  too brief to enable us to say with certainty  that it refers to a water-powered paper mill  10  11  while this is seen by halevi nonetheless as evidence of samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper  he concedes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the islamic world at the time  12  robert i  burns remains altogether sceptical given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in islamic papermaking elsewhere  1 
hill notes that paper mills appear in early christian catalonian documentation from the 1150s  which may imply islamic origins  but here too hard evidence is lacking  13  14  and the case for early catalan water-powered paper mills has been thoroughly dismissed after a re-examination of the evidence cited by burns  15  likewise  the identification of early hydraulic stamping mills in medieval documents from fabriano  italy  is completely without substance  16 
the earliest certain evidence to a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the spanish kingdom of aragon  17  a decree by the christian king peter iii addresses the establishment of a royal  molendinum   a proper hydraulic mill  in the paper manufacturing centre of xtiva  17  the crown innovation appears to be resented by the local muslim papermakering community  the document guarantees the muslim subjects the right to continue their way of traditional papermaking by beating the pulp manually and grants them the right to be exempted from work in the new mill  17 
the first permanent paper mill north of the alps was established in nuremberg by ulman stromer in 1390  it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated nuremberg chronicle  18  from the mid-14th century onwards  european paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes  19 
20th century edit 
by the early 20th century  paper mills sprang up around new england and the rest of the world  due to the high demand for paper  at this time  there were many world leaders of the production of paper  one of such was the brown company in berlin  new hampshire run by william wentworth brown  during the year 1907  the brown company cut between 30 and 40 million acres of woodlands on their property  20  which extended from la tuque  quebec  canada to west palm  florida  21 
log drives were conducted on local rivers to send the logs to the mills  by the late 20th and early 21st-century  paper mills began to close and the log drives became a dying craft  22  due to the addition of new machinery  many millworkers were laid off and many of the historic paper mills closed  23 
characteristics edit 
main articles  pulp mill and paper machine
paper mills can be fully integrated mills or nonintegrated mills  integrated mills consist of a pulp mill and a paper mill on the same site  such mills receive logs or wood chips and produce paper 
the modern paper mill uses large amounts of energy  water  and wood pulp in an efficient and complex series of processes  and control technology to produce a sheet of paper that can be used in diverse ways  modern paper machines can be 500 feet  150m  in length  produce a sheet 400 inches  10m  wide  and operate at speeds of more than 60 miles per hour  97km h   24  the two main suppliers of paper machines are metso and voith

it has also become universal to talk of paper  mills   even of 400 such mills at fez    relating these to the hydraulic wonders of islamic society in the east and west  all our evidence points to non-hydraulic hand production  however  at springs away from rivers which it could pollute 
  thompson 1978  p 169 
european papermaking differed from its precursors in the mechanization of the process and in the application of water power  jean gimpel  in the medieval machine  the english translation of la revolution industrielle du moyen age   points out that the chinese and arabs used only human and animal force  gimpel goes on to say   this is convincing evidence of how technologically minded the europeans of that era were  paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world  but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture

al-hassan and hill also use as evidence the statement by robert forbes in his multivolume studies in ancient technology that  in the tenth century  ad  floating mills were found on the tigris near baghdad   though such captive mills were known to the romans and were used in 12th-century france  forbes offers no citation or evidence for this unlikely application to very early papermaking  the most erudite authority on the topography of medieval baghdad  george makdisi  writes me that he has no recollection of such floating papermills or any papermills  which  i think i would have remembered

donald hill has found a reference in al-biruni in the 11th century to stones  fixed to axles across running water  as in samarkand with the pounding of flax for paper   a possible exception to the rule  hill finds the notice  too brief to enable us to say with certainty  that this was a water-powered triphammer

thomas glick warily concludes that  it is assumed but not proved  that islamic xtiva had hydraulic papermills  noting that the pertinent arabic description was  a press   since the  oldest  catalan paper is physically the same as islamic xtiva s  he notes  their techniques  can be presumed to have been identical  - reasonable enough for catalan paper before 1280  my recent conversations with glick indicate that he now inclines to non-hydraulic andalusi papermaking

currently oriol valls i subin t  director of the history of paper department of the museos municipales de historia in the instituto municipal de historia at barcelona  has popularized a version of that thesis  in which christian paper mills multiplied marvelously along the catalan rivers  from tarragona to the pyrenees  from 1113 to 1244  his many articles and two books  valuable for such topics as fiber analysis in medieval paper  continue to spread this untenable and indeed bizarre thesis  as josep madurell i marimon shows in detail  these were all in fact cloth fulling mills  textiles were then the basic mechanized industry of the christian west

fabriano s claim rests on two charters - a gift of august 1276  and a sale of november 1278  to the new benedictine congregation of silvestrine monks at montefano  in each  a woman recluse-hermit gives to the monastery her enclosure or  prison  - latin carcer  misread by fabriano partisans as a form of italian cartiera or paper mill  there is no papermaking in these documents  much less hydraulic mills
