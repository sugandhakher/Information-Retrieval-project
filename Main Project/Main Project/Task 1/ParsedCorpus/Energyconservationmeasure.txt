main article  energy conservation
an energy conservation measure  ecm  is any type of project conducted  or technology implemented  to reduce the consumption of energy in a building  the types of projects implemented can be in a variety of forms but usually are designed to reduce utility costs  water  electricity and gas being the main three for industrial and commercial enterprises  the aim of an ecm should be to achieve a savings  reducing the amount of energy used by a particular process  technology or facility 
energy conservation measures are often combined into larger guaranteed energy savings performance contracts to maximize energy savings while minimizing disruption to building occupants by coordinating renovations  some ecms cost less to implement yet return a higher energy savings  traditionally  lighting projects were a good example of low hanging fruit 1  that could be used to drive implementation of more substantial upgrades to hvac systems in large facilities  smaller buildings might combine window replacement with modern insulation using advanced building foams to improve energy performance  energy dashboard projects 2  are a new kind of ecm which relies on the behavioral change of building occupants to save energy  when implemented as part of a program  case studies  such as that for the dc schools  report energy savings up 30   3  under the right circumstances  open energy dashboards can even be implemented for free 4  to improve upon these savings even more 
on a global basis energy efficiency works behind the scenes to improve our energy security  lower our energy bills and move us closer to reaching our climate goals  according to the iea  some 40  of the global energy efficiency market is financed with debt and equity  5  energy performance investment are one financing mechanism by which ecms can be implemented now and paid for by the savings realized over the life of the project  while all 50 states  puerto rico and washington  d c   have statutes allowing companies to offer energy savings performance contracts  success varies because of variations in the approach  the states degree of involvement and other factors  6  7  homes and businesses are implementing energy-efficiency measures that include low-energy lighting  insulation and even high tech energy dashboards to cut bills by avoiding waste and boosting productivity 
businesses implementing ecms in their commercial buildings often employ energy service companies  escos  experienced in energy performance contracting   this industry has been around since the 1970s and is more prevalent than ever today  the us-based organization evo  efficiency valuation organization  8  has created a set of guidelines for escos to adhere to in evaluating the savings achieved by ecms  these guidelines are called the international performance measurement and verification protocol  ipmvp  
homeowners implementing ecms in their residential buildings often start with an energy audit  this is a way homeowners look at what areas of their homes are using  and possibly losing energy  residential energy auditors are accredited by the building performance institute  bpi  9  or the residential energy services network  resnet   10  11  homeowners can hire a professional or do it themselves 12  13  or use a smartphone to help do an audit  14

types of energy conservation measures edit 
energy dashboards edit 
energy dashboards combine smart metering and internet technologies to provide real-time data on energy use  their success is based on the premise that real-time feedback drives behavior change and improves operational efficiency  energy dashboards are used to enable energy reduction competitions  showcase real-time building performance and green building features  and empower occupants to become active participants in energy management  sustainability teams from major corporations  governments  universities and k12 public schools use energy dashboards as an effective communication tool that creates transparency

insulation edit 
insulation decreases thermal losses in cold climates and thermal gains in hot climates thus reducing hvac loads 
house insulation
thermal insulation
cotton insulation
natural wool insulation
vocs in fiberglass insulation
cellulose insulation
lighting edit 
one of the simplest ways consumers save a copious amount of energy is switching incandescent light bulb to a compact fluorescent lamp  cfl   a 15w cfl is capable of providing just as much light as a 60w incandescent  while consuming just one fourth of the amount of energy  15 
compact fluorescent lamp
fluorescent bulbs
led lighting
linear fluorescent retrofit  t12 to t8 
sky lights
smart windows
solar charged flashlight
solar lights
water edit 
the average us homes wastes thousands of gallons of water a year  16  17  there are many water saving solutions that also save energy  18 
1.6 gpm or less low flow showerheads
ultra low flush toilet
composting toilets
faucet aerator
windows edit 
windows may be one of the biggest contributing factors to energy loss and uncomfortable spaces  19  individuals might find some ecms related to windows more cost effective than others such as thermal curtains  films  or smart windows
