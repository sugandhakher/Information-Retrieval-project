the annual fuel utilization efficiency  afue  pronounced  a - few  or  a - f - u - e   is a thermal efficiency measure of combustion equipment like furnaces  boilers  and water heaters  the afue differs from the true  thermal efficiency  in that it is not a steady-state  peak measure of conversion efficiency  but instead attempts to represent the actual  season-long  average efficiency of that piece of equipment  including the operating transients  1  it is a dimensionless ratio of useful energy output to energy input  expressed as a percentage  for example  a 90  afue for a gas furnace means it outputs 90 btus of useful heating for every 100 btus of natural gas input  where the rest may be wasted heat in the exhaust   a higher afue means higher efficiency 
the method for determining the afue for residential furnaces is the subject of ashrae standard 103  a furnace with a thermal efficiency  th  of 78  may yield an afue of only 64  or so  for example  under the standard s test conditions  when estimating annual or seasonal energy used by combustion devices  the afue is the better efficiency measure to use in the calculations  2  but for an instantaneous fuel consumption rate  the thermal efficiency may be better 
note that the theoretical limit for a conventional furnace s instantaneous efficiency is 100   whereas a heat pump used for building heating may exceed 100   for example  a cop of 1.5 is equivalent to 150   heat pumps are readily available for electric and gas sources  3  so from a theoretical perspective  in some use cases the name  efficiency  may be misleading
