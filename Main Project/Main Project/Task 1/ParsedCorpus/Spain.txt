etymology
the origins of the roman name hispania  from which the modern name espaa was derived  are uncertain due to inadequate evidence  down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses 
lady of elche
the renaissance scholar antonio de nebrija proposed that the word hispania evolved from the iberian word hispalis  meaning  city of the western world  
jess luis cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the phoenician word spy  meaning  to forge metals   therefore  i-spn-ya would mean  the land where metals are forged   9  it may be a derivation of the phoenician i-shpania  meaning  island of rabbits    land of rabbits  or  edge   a reference to spain s location at the end of the mediterranean  roman coins struck in the region from the reign of hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet  10  and strabo called it the  land of the rabbits   11 
hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term hesperia  reflecting the greek perception of italy as a  western land  or  land of the setting sun   hesperia   in greek  and spain  being still further west  as hesperia ultima  12 
there is the claim that  hispania  derives from the basque word ezpanna meaning  edge  or  border   another reference to the fact that the iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the european continent  12 
two 15th-century spanish jewish scholars  don isaac abrabanel and solomon ibn verga  gave an explanation now considered folkloric  both men wrote in two different published works that the first jews to reach spain were brought by ship by phiros who was confederate with the king of babylon when he laid siege to jerusalem  this man was a grecian by birth  but who had been given a kingdom in spain  he became related by marriage to espan  the nephew of king heracles  who also ruled over a kingdom in spain  heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native greece  leaving his kingdom to his nephew  espan  from whom the country of espaa  spain  took its name  based upon their testimonies  this eponym would have already been in use in spain by c  350 bce  13

reproduction of altamira cave paintings  14  in cantabria 
iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the iberians  basques and celts  after an arduous conquest  the peninsula came under the rule of the roman empire  during the early middle ages it came under germanic rule but later  much of it was conquered by moorish invaders from north africa  in a process that took centuries  the small christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula  the last moorish kingdom fell in the same year columbus reached the americas  a global empire began which saw spain become the strongest kingdom in europe  the leading world power for a century and a half  and the largest overseas empire for three centuries 
continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status  the napoleonic invasions of spain led to chaos  triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable  prior to the second world war  spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government  which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy  eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy  spain joined the european union  experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth

archaeological research at atapuerca indicates the iberian peninsula was populated by hominids 1.2million years ago  15  in atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in europe  the homo antecessor  modern humans first arrived in iberia  from the north on foot  about 35,000 years ago  16  not in citation given  the best known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the altamira cave of cantabria in northern iberia  which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 bce by cro-magnon  14  17  archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the iberian peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age 
the largest groups inhabiting the iberian peninsula before the roman conquest were the iberians and the celts  the iberians inhabited the mediterranean side of the peninsula  from the northeast to the southeast  the celts inhabited much of the inner and atlantic sides of the peninsula  from the northwest to the southwest  basques occupied the western area of the pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas  the tartessians were in the southwest and the lusitanians and vettones occupied areas in the central west  a number of trading settlements of phoenicians  greeks and carthaginians developed on the mediterranean coast

during the second punic war  an expanding roman republic captured carthaginian trading colonies along the mediterranean coast from roughly 210 to 205bc  it took the romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the iberian peninsula  though they had control of it for over six centuries  roman rule was bound together by law  language  and the roman road  18 
conversion of reccared to chalcedonian christianity 
the cultures of the celtic and iberian populations were gradually romanised  latinised  at differing rates in different parts of hispania  local leaders were admitted into the roman aristocratic class  h  19  hispania served as a granary for the roman market  and its harbours exported gold  wool  olive oil  and wine  agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects  some of which remain in use  emperors hadrian  trajan  theodosius i  and the philosopher seneca were born in hispania  i  christianity was introduced into hispania in the 1st century ad and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century ad  19  most of spain s present languages and religion  and the basis of its laws  originate from this period  18 
toledo  capital of the visigothic kingdom 
the weakening of the western roman empire s jurisdiction in hispania began in 409  when the germanic suebi and vandals  together with the sarmatian alans  crossed the rhine and ravaged gaul until the visigoths drove them into iberia that same year  the suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern galicia and northern portugal  as the western empire disintegrated  the social and economic base became greatly simplified  but even in modified form  the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire  including christianity and assimilation to the evolving roman culture 
the alans  allies  the hasdingi vandals  established a kingdom in gallaecia  too  occupying largely the same region but extending farther south to the douro river  the silingi vandals occupied the region that still bears a form of their namevandalusia  modern andalusia  in spain  the byzantines established an enclave  spania  in the south  with the intention of reviving the roman empire throughout iberia  eventually  however  hispania was reunited under visigothic rule 
isidore of seville  archbishop of seville  was an influential philosopher and was much studied in the middle ages in europe  also  his theories were vital to the conversion of the visigothic kingdom to a catholic one  in the councils of toledo  this gothic kingdom was the first christian kingdom ruling in the iberian peninsula  and in the reconquista it was the referent for the different kingdoms fighting against the muslim rule

in the 8th century  nearly all of the iberian peninsula was conquered  711718  by largely moorish muslim armies from north africa  these conquests were part of the expansion of the umayyad caliphate  only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion 
under islamic law  christians and jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi  this status permitted christians and jews to practice their religions as people of the book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of muslims  20  21 
conversion to islam proceeded at an increasing pace  the mulades  muslims of ethnic iberian origin  are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of al-andalus by the end of the 10th century  22  23 
the muslim community in the iberian peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions  the berber people of north africa  who had provided the bulk of the invading armies  clashed with the arab leadership from the middle east  j  over time  large moorish populations became established  especially in the guadalquivir river valley  the coastal plain of valencia  the ebro river valley and  towards the end of this period  in the mountainous region of granada  23

crdoba  the capital of the caliphate since abd-ar-rahman iii  was the largest  richest and most sophisticated city in western europe  mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished  muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the middle east and north africa  muslim and jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical greek learning in western europe  some important philosophers at the time were averroes  ibn arabi and maimonides  the romanised cultures of the iberian peninsula interacted with muslim and jewish cultures in complex ways  giving the region a distinctive culture  23  outside the cities  where the vast majority lived  the land ownership system from roman times remained largely intact as muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture

in the 11th century  the muslim holdings fractured into rival taifa kingdoms  allowing the small christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories  23  the arrival from north africa of the islamic ruling sects of the almoravids and the almohads restored unity upon the muslim holdings  with a stricter  less tolerant application of islam  and saw a revival in muslim fortunes  this re-united islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed christian gains

the reconquista  reconquest  was the centuries-long period in which christian rule was re-established over the iberian peninsula  the reconquista is viewed as beginning with the battle of covadonga won by don pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of muslim rule on the iberian peninsula  the christian army s victory over muslim forces led to the creation of the christian kingdom of asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains  shortly after  in 739  muslim forces were driven from galicia  which was to eventually host one of medieval europe s holiest sites  santiago de compostela and was incorporated into the new christian kingdom  the kingdom of len was the strongest christian kingdom for centuries  in 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in europe was held in len  cortes of len   the kingdom of castile  formed from leonese territory  was its successor as strongest kingdom  the kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period  the example of the roman emperors influenced the political objective of the crown  while the nobles benefited from feudalism 
muslim armies had also moved north of the pyrenees but they were defeated by frankish forces at the battle of poitiers  frankia  later  frankish forces established christian counties on the southern side of the pyrenees  these areas were to grow into the kingdoms of navarre and aragon  24  for several centuries  the fluctuating frontier between the muslim and christian controlled areas of iberia was along the ebro and douro valleys

the county of barcelona and the kingdom of aragon entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the mediterranean  in 1229 mallorca was conquered  so was valencia in 1238 
the break-up of al-andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled iberian christian kingdoms gain the initiative  the capture of the strategically central city of toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the christian kingdoms  following a great muslim resurgence in the 12th century  the great moorish strongholds in the south fell to christian spain in the 13th centurycrdoba in 1236 and seville in 1248  the last nasrid sultanate of granada  a muslim tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the catholic monarchs queen isabella i of castile 25  and king ferdinand ii of aragon  26  27  28

in 1469  the crowns of the christian kingdoms of castile and aragon were united by the marriage of isabella i of castile and ferdinand ii of aragon  1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the canary islands and in 1492  the combined forces of castile and aragon captured the emirate of granada  ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of islamic rule in iberia  that same year  spain s jews were ordered to convert to catholicism or face expulsion from spanish territories during the spanish inquisition  31  the treaty of granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards muslims  32  and although the tolerance was only partial  it was not until the beginning of the 17th century  following the revolt of the alpujarras  that muslims were finally expelled  k  33 
the year 1492 also marked the arrival of christopher columbus in the new world  during a voyage funded by isabella  columbus s first voyage crossed the atlantic and reached the caribbean islands  beginning the european exploration and conquest of the americas  although he remained convinced that he had reached the orient  the colonisation of the americas started  with conquistadores like hernn corts and francisco pizarro  miscegenation was the rule between the native and the european cultures and people 
christopher columbus meets isabella i of castile and ferdinand ii of aragon in the alhambra 
as renaissance new monarchs  isabella and ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility  and the word espaa  whose root is the ancient name hispania  began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms  33  with their wide-ranging political  legal  religious and military reforms  spain emerged as the first world power 
the unification of the crowns of aragon and castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern spain and the spanish empire  although each kingdom of spain remained a separate country  in social  political  laws  currency and language  34  35 
there were two big revolts against the new habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown  revolt of the comuneros in castile and revolt of the brotherhoods in mallorca and valencia  after years of combat  comuneros juan lpez de padilla  juan bravo and francisco maldonado were executed and maria pacheco went into exile  germana de foix also finished with the revolt in the mediterranean 
maria pacheco  last leader of the comuneros 
spain was europe s leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century  a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world s leading maritime power  it reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two spanish habsburgscharles i  15161556  and philip ii  15561598   this period saw the italian wars  the revolt of the comuneros  the dutch revolt  the morisco revolt  clashes with the ottomans  the anglo-spanish war and wars with france  36 
anachronous map of the spanish empire including territorial claims 
through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance  the spanish empire expanded to include vast areas in the americas  islands in the asia-pacific area  areas of italy  cities in northern africa  as well as parts of what are now france  germany  belgium  luxembourg  and the netherlands  the first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 15191521  it was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set  this was an age of discovery  with daring explorations by sea and by land  the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans  conquests and the beginnings of european colonialism  spanish explorers brought back precious metals  spices  luxuries  and previously unknown plants  and played a leading part in transforming the european understanding of the globe  37  the cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the spanish golden age  the expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from europe devastated american indigenous populations  the rise of humanism  the counter-reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the school of salamanca  which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights 
philip ii and charles v  habsburg spain  charles was also emperor of the holy roman empire 
in the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century  spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides  barbary pirates  under the aegis of the rapidly growing ottoman empire  disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an islamic invasion  38  this was at a time when spain was often at war with france 
the protestant reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars  the result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across europe and in the mediterranean  39 
by the middle decades of a war- and plague-ridden 17th-century europe  the spanish habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts  these conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally  spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered habsburg empire  and help the imperial forces of the holy roman empire reverse a large part of the advances made by protestant forces  but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of portugal  with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640  and the netherlands  and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to france in the latter stages of the immensely destructive  europe-wide thirty years  war  40 
the family of philip v  1743   during the enlightenment in spain a new royal family reigned  the house of bourbon 
in the latter half of the 17th century  spain went into a gradual decline  during which it surrendered several small territories to france and the netherlands  however  it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire  which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century 
the decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century  the war of the spanish succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war  and was to cost the kingdom its european possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the continent  41  during this war  a new dynasty originating in france  the bourbons  was installed  long united only by the crown  a true spanish state was established when the first bourbon king  philip v  united the crowns of castile and aragon into a single state  abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws  42 
the 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire  the new bourbon monarchy drew on the french system of modernising the administration and the economy  enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom s elite and monarchy  military assistance for the rebellious british colonies in the american war of independence improved the kingdom s international standing  43

the third of may 1808 by francisco de goya depicts an episode of the spanish independence war 
in 1793  spain went to war against the revolutionary new french republic as a member of the first coalition  the subsequent war of the pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field  peace was made with france in 1795 at the peace of basel in which spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of hispaniola  the prime minister  manuel godoy  then ensured that spain allied herself with france in the brief war of the third coalition which ended with the british victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805  in 1807  a secret treaty between napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against britain and portugal  napoleon s troops entered the country to invade portugal but instead occupied spain s major fortresses  the ridiculed spanish king abdicated in favour of napoleon s brother  joseph bonaparte 
joseph bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the spanish  the 2 may 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the bonapartist regime  44  these revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the napoleonic regime  45  napoleon was forced to intervene personally  defeating several spanish armies and forcing a british army to retreat  however  further military action by spanish armies  guerrillas and wellington s british-portuguese forces  combined with napoleon s disastrous invasion of russia  led to the ousting of the french imperial armies from spain in 1814  and the return of king ferdinand vii  46 
during the war  in 1810  a revolutionary body  the cortes of cdiz  was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution  47  it met as one body  and its members represented the entire spanish empire  48  in 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the bonapartist regime ferdinand vii dismissed the cortes generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch  these events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries

the mediterranean climate  characterised by warm hot and dry summers  it is dominant in the peninsula  with two varieties  csa and csb according to the kppen climate classification  the csb zone has warm rather than hot summers  and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a mediterranean climate  such as much of central and northern-central of spain  e g  lon  or vila  and into much ranier areas  notably galicia 
the semi-arid climate  bsh  bsk   located in the southeastern quarter of the country  especially in the region of murcia and in the ebro valley  the dry season extends beyond the summer 
the oceanic climate  cfb   located in the northern quarter of the country  especially in the region of basque country  cantabria  asturias and partly galicia  winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean  and have no seasonal drought 
apart from these main types  other sub-types can be found  like the alpine climate in the pyrenees and sierra nevada  and a typical desert climate in the zone of almera  murcia and in most of the canary islands  low-lying areas of the canary islands average above 18.0c  64.4f  during their coldest month  thus having a tropical climate

spain s autonomous regions are the first level administrative divisions of the country  they were created after the current constitution came into effect  in 1978  in recognition of the right to self-government of the  nationalities and regions of spain   72  the autonomous regions were to be integrated into adjacent provinces with common historical  cultural  and economical traits  this territorial organisation  based on devolution  is literally known in spain as the  state of autonomies  
the basic institutional law of each autonomous region is the statute of autonomy  the statutes of autonomy establish the name of the region according to its historical identity  the limits of its territories  the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution  73 
the governments of all autonomous regions must be based on a division of powers comprising 
a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by universal suffrage according to the system of proportional representation and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented 
a government council  with executive and administrative functions headed by a president  elected by the legislative assembly and nominated by the king of spain 
a supreme court  under the supreme court of spain  which heads the judiciary in the autonomous region 
catalonia  galicia and the basque country  which identified themselves as  nationalities  were granted self-government through a rapid process  andalusia also took that denomination in its first statute of autonomy  even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country  progressively  other communities in revisions to their statutes of autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical regional identity  such as the valencian community  74  the canary islands  75  the balearic islands  76  and aragon  77 
the autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy  with their own parliaments and regional governments  the distribution of powers may be different for every community  as laid out in their statutes of autonomy  since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical  only two communitiesthe basque country and navarrehave full fiscal autonomy  aside of fiscal autonomy  the  historical  nationalitiesandalusia  the basque country  catalonia  and galiciawere devolved more powers than the rest of the communities  among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time  in addition  the basque country  catalonia and navarre have police corps of their own  ertzaintza  mossos d esquadra and the polica foral respectively  other communities have more limited forces or none at all  like the polica autnoma andaluza 78  in andalusia or the bescam in madrid 
hall of the consell de cent  local body of barcelona between the 13th and 18th centuries 
nonetheless  recent amendments to existing statutes of autonomy or the promulgation of new statutes altogether  have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the  historical nationalities  and the rest of the regions 
finally  along with the 17 autonomous communities  two autonomous cities are also part of the state of autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions  ceuta and melilla  these are two exclaves located in the northern african coast 
provinces and municipalities
main articles  provinces of spain and municipalities of spain
autonomous communities are subdivided into provinces  which served as their territorial building blocks  in turn  provinces are integrated by municipalities  the existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution  not necessarily by the statutes of autonomy themselves  municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs  and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the state  79 
the current provincial division structure is basedwith minor changeson the 1833 territorial division by javier de burgos  and in all  the spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces  the communities of asturias  cantabria  la rioja  the balearic islands  madrid  murcia and navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province  which is coextensive with the community itself  in these cases  the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community

after the return of democracy following the death of franco in 1975  spain s foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the franco years and expand diplomatic relations  enter the european community  and define security relations with the west 
as a member of nato since 1982  spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities  spain s eu membership represents an important part of its foreign policy  even on many international issues beyond western europe  spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its eu partners through the european political co-operation mechanisms  vague 
spain has maintained its special relations with hispanic america and the philippines  its policy emphasises the concept of an ibero-american community  essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of  hispanidad  or  hispanismo   as it is often referred to in english  which has sought to link the iberian peninsula with hispanic america through language  commerce  history and culture 
territorial disputes
spain claims gibraltar  a 6-square-kilometre  2.3sqmi  overseas territory of the united kingdom in the southernmost part of the iberian peninsula  then a spanish town  it was conquered by an anglo-dutch force in 1704 during the war of the spanish succession on behalf of archduke charles  pretender to the spanish throne 
the legal situation concerning gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the treaty of utrecht  in which spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the british crown 80  stating that  should the british abandon this post  it would be offered to spain first  since the 1940s spain has called for the return of gibraltar  the overwhelming majority of gibraltarians strongly oppose this  along with any proposal of shared sovereignty  81  un resolutions call on the united kingdom and spain  both eu members  to reach an agreement over the status of gibraltar  82  83 
the spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the rock to the spanish mainland on the one hand  and the rock and city of gibraltar on the other  while the rock and city were ceded by the treaty of utrecht  spain asserts that the  occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of international law   84  the united kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus  85  as there has been  continuous possession  of the isthmus  over a long period   86 
sahrawi arab democratic republic army  according to united nations  spain is the administrative power of the western sahara de iure  87 
another claim by spain is about the savage islands  a claim not recognised by portugal  spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands  therefore claiming that there is no portuguese territorial waters around the disputed islands  on 5 july 2013  spain sent a letter to the un expressing these views  88  89 
spain claims the sovereignty over the perejil island  a small  uninhabited rocky islet located in the south shore of the strait of gibraltar  the island lies 250 metres  820ft  just off the coast of morocco  8 kilometres  5.0mi  from ceuta and 13.5 kilometres  8.4mi  from mainland spain  its sovereignty is disputed between spain and morocco  it was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002  the incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the moroccan occupation of the island  the islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty 
besides the perejil island  the spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two  morocco claims the spanish cities of ceuta and melilla and the plazas de soberana islets off the northern coast of africa  and portugal does not recognise spain s sovereignty over the territory of olivenza

native spaniards make up 88  of the total population of spain  after the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and spain s population growth rate dropped  the population again trended upward  based initially on the return of many spaniards who had emigrated to other european countries during the 1970s  and more recently  fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12  of the population  the immigrants originate mainly in latin america  39    north africa  16    eastern europe  15    and sub-saharan africa  4    127  in 2005  spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency

main articles  spanish people and nationalisms and regionalisms of spain
asturian folk musicians with bagpipes 
the spanish constitution of 1978  in its second article  recognises historic entitiesnationalities  a carefully chosen word to avoid the more politically charged  nations  and regions  within the context of the spanish nation  for some people  spain s identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole spanish identity  indeed  some of the regional identities may even conflict with the spanish one  distinct traditional regional identities within spain include the basques  catalans  galicians  andalusians and valencians  139  although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities will claim a distinct historic identity 
it is this last feature of  shared identity  between the more local level or autonomous community and the spanish level which makes the identity question in spain complex and far from univocal 
minority groups
spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies  especially latin america and north africa  smaller numbers of immigrants from several sub-saharan countries have recently been settling in spain  there are also sizeable numbers of asian immigrants  most of whom are of middle eastern  south asian and chinese origin  the single largest group of immigrants are european  represented by large numbers of britons  germans  french and others  140 
ceuta and melilla have a big population of north african ancestry 
the arrival of the gitanos  a romani people  began in the 16th century  estimates of the spanish gitano population range from 750,000 to over one million  141  142  143  144  145  there are also the mercheros  also quinquis   a formerly nomadic minority group  their origin is unclear 
historically  sephardi jews and moriscos are the main minority groups originated in spain and with a contribution to spanish culture  146  the spanish government is offering spanish nationality to sephardi jews  147 
immigration
main article  immigration to spain
marbella  mlaga  where britonswho are the third biggest immigrant community in spainreside in large numbers 
according to the spanish government there were 5.7million foreign residents in spain in 2011  or 12  of the total population  according to residence permit data for 2011  more than 860,000 were romanian  about 770,000 were moroccan  approximately 390,000 were british  and 360,000 were ecuadorian  148  other sizeable foreign communities are colombian  bolivian  german  italian  bulgarian  and chinese  there are more than 200,000 migrants from sub-saharan africa living in spain  principally senegaleses and nigerians  149  since 2000  spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows  despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level  this sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants  particularly those arriving illegally by sea  has caused noticeable social tension  150 
palma de mallorca where a large population of germans live 
within the eu  spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after cyprus  but by a great margin  the highest in absolute numbers  up to 2008  151  the number of immigrants in spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2million in 2008 out of a total population of 46million  152  153  in 2005 alone  a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people  154  there are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration  including spain s cultural ties with latin america  its geographical position  the porosity of its borders  the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors  which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce 
another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of eu origin typically retiring to spain s mediterranean coast  in fact  spain was europe s largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007  with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5million people arrived  155  in 2008  prior to the onset of the economic crisis  the financial times reported that spain was the most favoured destination for western europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the eu  156 
in 2008  the government instituted a  plan of voluntary return  which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the eu to return to their home countries and receive several incentives  including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the spanish social security  157  the programme had little effect  during its first two months  just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer  158  what the programme failed to do  the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs  in 2011 alone  more than half a million people left spain  159  for the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative  and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners  159

altogether  about 22  of the entire spanish population attends religious services at least once per month  172  though spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades  the influx of latin american immigrants  who tend to be strong catholic practitioners  has helped the catholic church to recover

the recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of hindus  buddhists  sikhs and muslims  after the reconquista in 1492  muslims did not live in spain for centuries  late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern africa gave a number of residents in spanish morocco and western sahara full citizenship  their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration  especially from morocco and algeria

the group that has become known as the generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of spain s fleet in cuba by us gunboats in 1898  which provoked a cultural crisis in spain  the  disaster  of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political  economic  and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of regeneracionismo  for a group of younger writers  among them miguel de unamuno  po baroja  and jos martnez ruiz  azorn   the disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper  more radical literary shift that affected both form and content  these writers  along with ramn del valle-incln  antonio machado  ramiro de maeztu  and ngel ganivet  came to be known as the  generation of 98  
ramn del valle-incln  mara zambrano and federico garca lorca

the generation of 1927  where poets pedro salinas  jorge guilln  federico garca lorca  vicente aleixandre  dmaso alonso  all were scholars of their national literary heritage  again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the generation of 1898 for spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards
