leadership in energy and environmental design  leed  edit 
the leed green building rating system  leed  is a program that provides third-party verification of green buildings  the leed rating systems address both a wide variety of buildings types  including commercial buildings  homes  neighborhoods  retail  healthcare  and schools  as well as every phase of the building lifecycle including design  construction  operations and maintenance  3  projects may earn one of four levels of leed certification  certified  silver  gold or platinum  by achieving a given number of point-based credits within the rating system 
development of leed began in 1993  spearheaded by natural resources defense council  nrdc  senior scientist robert k  watson  as founding chairman of the leed steering committee  watson led a broad-based consensus process which included non-profit organizations  government agencies  architects  engineers  developers  builders  product manufacturers and other industry leaders until 2006  the leed initiative was supported by a strong usgbc board of directors  chaired by steven winter from 1999 to 2003  and very active staff  including nigel howard   4 at that time  usgbcs current senior vice president of leed  scot horst  became chair of the leed steering committee before joining usgbc staff  early leed committee members also included usgbc co-founder mike italiano  architects bill reed and sandy mendler  builder gerard heiber and myron kibbe and engineer richard bourne  as interest in leed grew  in 1996  engineers tom paladino and lynn barker co-chaired the newly formed leed technical committee 
beginning with its launch in 2000  leed has grown from one rating system for new construction to a comprehensive system of nine interrelated rating systems covering all aspects of the development and construction process  3  since its inception  leed has grown from six volunteers on one committee to more than 200 volunteers on nearly 20 committees and nearly 200 professional staff 
usgbc was awarded the american architectural foundations keystone award in 2012  the national building museum presented the usgbc with its 2009 honor award  themed  visionaries in sustainability    citing the organization s  exceptional achievement in establishing and integrating green building standards  in its leed systems as one of the reasons for selection  5  the museum also awarded usgbc with its henry c  turner prize in 2005 for its leadership and innovation in the construction industry  specifically for leed  6  to date  it is the only organization to have received two awards from the building museum 
leed standards have been criticized for not actually creating energy efficient buildings  in 2013  the washington examiner analyzed energy efficiency data of new york city buildings and found that leed-certified buildings actually performed worse than buildings in general  7  an analysis by usa today found that building makers target leeds easiest pointsthose that dont necessarily increase the energy efficiency of a building  8 
legislation edit
