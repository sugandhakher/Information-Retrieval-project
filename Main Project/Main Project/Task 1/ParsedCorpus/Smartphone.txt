history edit 
early years edit 
the first caller identification receiver  1971  
devices that combined telephony and computing were first conceptualized by nikola tesla in 1909 and theodore paraskevakos in 1971 and patented in 1974  and were offered for sale beginning in 1993  paraskevakos was the first to introduce the concepts of intelligence  data processing and visual display screens into telephones  in 1971  while he was working with boeing in huntsville  alabama  paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment  however it did not yet have general purpose pda applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones  they were installed at peoples  telephone company in leesburg  alabama and were demonstrated to several telephone companies  the original and historic working models are still in the possession of paraskevakos  9 
forerunner edit 
ibm simon and charging base  1994   10 
the first mobile phone to incorporate pda features was an ibm prototype developed in 1992 and demonstrated that year at the comdex computer industry trade show  it included pda features and other visionary mobile applications such as maps  stock reports and news  a refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by bellsouth under the name simon personal communicator  the simon was the first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a  smartphone   although it was not called that in 1994  11  12  13  in addition to placing and receiving cellular calls  simon could send and receive faxes and emails and included an address book  calendar  appointment scheduler  calculator  world time clock and notepad  utilizing its touch screen display  14  the term  smart phone  appeared in print as early as 1995  describing at t s phonewriter communicator  15  non-primary source needed 
pdas edit 
main article  personal digital assistant
in the mid-late 1990s  many mobile phone users carried a separate dedicated pda device  running early versions of operating systems such as palm os  blackberry os or windows ce pocket pc  1  these operating systems would later evolve into mobile operating systems  in march 1996  hewlett-packard released the omnigo 700lx  a modified 200lx pda that supported a nokia 2110-compatible phone with rom-based software to support it  it had a 640x200 resolution cga compatible 4-shade gray-scale lcd screen and could be used to place and receive calls  and to create and receive text messages  emails and faxes  it was also 100  dos 5.0 compatible  allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles  including early versions of windows 
in august 1996  nokia released the nokia 9000 communicator  a digital cellular phone based on the nokia 2110 with an integrated pda based on the geos v3.0 operating system from geoworks  the two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design  with the display above and a physical qwerty keyboard below  the pda provided e-mail  calendar  address book  calculator and notebook applications  text-based web browsing  and could send and receive faxes  when closed  the device could be used as a digital cellular phone  in june 1999 qualcomm released the  pdq smartphone   a cdma digital pcs smartphone with an integrated palm pda and internet connectivity  16 
subsequent landmark devices included 
the ericsson r380  2000  by ericsson mobile communications  17  the first device marketed as a  smartphone   18  it combined the functions of a mobile phone and pda  and supported limited web browsing with a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus  19 
the kyocera 6035  early 2001  introduced by palm  inc  combining a pda with a mobile phone  it operated on the verizon network  and supported limited web browsing  20  21 
handspring s treo 180  2002   the first smartphone to combine the palm os and a gsm phone with telephony  sms messaging and internet access fully integrated into the os  22 
smartphones before present-day android-  ios- and blackberry-based phones typically used the symbian operating system  originally developed by psion  it was the world s most widely used smartphone operating system until the last quarter of 2010  citation needed 
mass adoption edit 
in 1999  the japanese firm ntt docomo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country  these phones ran on i-mode  which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kbit s  23  unlike future generations of wireless services  ntt docomo s i-mode used chtml  a language which restricted some aspects of traditional html in favor of increasing data speed for the devices  limited functionality  small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available  24  the rise of i-mode helped ntt docomo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001  it was also ranked first in market capitalization in japan and second globally  this power would wane in the face of the rise of 3g and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities  25  outside japan smartphones were still rare until the introduction of the danger hiptop in 2002  which saw moderate success in the us as the t-mobile sidekick  later  in the mid-2000s  devices based on microsoft s windows mobile started to gain popularity among business users in the u s  the blackberry later gained mass adoption in the u s   and american users popularized the term  crackberry  in 2006 due to its addictive nature  26  the company first released its gsm blackberry 6210  blackberry 6220  and blackberry 6230 devices in 2003  27 
operating systems edit 
symbian was the most popular smartphone os in europe during the middle to late 2000s  initially  nokia s symbian devices were focused on business  similar to windows mobile and blackberry devices at the time  from 2006 onwards  nokia started producing entertainment-focused smartphones  popularized by the nseries  in asia  with the exception of japan  the trend was similar to that of europe  citation needed  in 2003  motorola launched the first smartphone to use linux  the a760 handset  28  while the initial release was limited to a single high-end handset only available in the asia-pacific region  the maker s intention was to eventually use linux on most of its handsets  including the lower-end models  further models to use linux such as the motorola ming a1200i in 2005 and several successors to the ming line would be unveiled through 2010  in late 2009  motorola released the motorola cliq  29  the first of motorola s smartphones to run the linux-based android operating system 
in early 2007  apple inc  introduced the iphone  one of the first smartphones to use a multi-touch interface  the iphone was notable for its use of a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction  instead of a stylus  keyboard  or keypad typical for smartphones at the time  30  in october 2008  the first phone to use android called the htc dream  also known as the t-mobile g1  was released  31  32  android is an open-source platform founded by andy rubin and now owned by google  33  34  although android s adoption was relatively slow at first  it started to gain widespread popularity in 2010  and in early 2012 dominated the smartphone market share worldwide  which continues to this day  35 
these new platforms led to the decline of earlier ones  microsoft  for instance  started a new os from scratch  called windows phone  nokia abandoned symbian and partnered with microsoft to use windows phone on its smartphones  windows phone then became the third-most-popular os  palm s webos was bought by hewlett-packard and later sold to lg electronics for use on lg smart tvs  blackberry limited  formerly known as research in motion  also made a new platform based on qnx  blackberry 10  the capacitive touchscreen also changed smartphone form factors  before 2007  it was common for devices to have a physical numeric keypad or physical qwerty keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor  however  by 2010  there were no top-selling smartphones with physical keypads
