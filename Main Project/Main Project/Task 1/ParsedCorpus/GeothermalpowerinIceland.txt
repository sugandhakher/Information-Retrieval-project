geothermal borehole outside the reykjanes power station
due to the geological location of iceland  over a rift in continental plates   the high concentration of volcanoes in the area is often an advantage in the generation of geothermal energy  the heating and production of electricity  1  during winter  pavements near these areas  such as reykjavik and akureyri  are heated up 
five major geothermal power plants exist in iceland  which produce approximately 26.2   2010  2  of the nation s electricity  in addition  geothermal heating meets the heating and hot water requirements of approximately 87  of all buildings in iceland  apart from geothermal energy  73.8  of the nations electricity is generated by hydro power  3  and 0.1  from fossil fuels  citation needed 
consumption of primary geothermal energy in 2004 was 79.7 petajoules  pj   approximately 53.4  of the total national consumption of primary energy  149.1 pj  the corresponding share for hydro power was 17.2   petroleum was 26.3   and coal was 3   4  plans are underway to turn iceland into a 100  fossil-fuel-free nation in the near future  5  for example  iceland s abundant geothermal energy has enabled renewable energy initiatives  such as carbon recycling international s carbon dioxide to methanol fuel process  6  the following are the five largest power stations in iceland  7 
hellisheii power station  303 mw 
nesjavellir geothermal power station  120 mw 
reykjanes power station  100 mw 
svartsengi power station  76.5 mw 
krafla power station  60 mw
