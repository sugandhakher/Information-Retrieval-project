hydrogen fuel is a zero-emission fuel when burned with oxygen  if one considers water not as an emission  or used in a contained cell also capable of  reversing  the reaction if needed  it often uses electrochemical cells  or combustion in internal engines  to power vehicles and electric devices  it is also used in the propulsion of spacecraft and might potentially be mass-produced and commercialized for passenger vehicles and aircraft 
hydrogen lies in the first group and first period in the periodic table  i e  it is the first element on the periodic table  making it the lightest element  since hydrogen gas is so light  it rises in the atmosphere and is therefore rarely found in its pure form  h2  1  in a flame of pure hydrogen gas  burning in air  the hydrogen  h2  reacts with oxygen  o2  to form water  h2o  and releases energy

 if carried out in atmospheric air instead of pure oxygen  as is usually the case   hydrogen combustion may yield small amounts of nitrogen oxides  along with the water vapor  
the energy released enables hydrogen to act as a fuel  in an electrochemical cell  that energy can be used with relatively high efficiency  if it simply is used for heat  the usual thermodynamics limits on the thermal efficiency apply 
since there is very little free hydrogen gas  hydrogen is in practice only an energy carrier  like electricity  not an energy resource  2  hydrogen gas must be produced  and that production always requires more energy than can be retrieved from the gas as a fuel later on  3  this is a limitation of the physical law of the conservation of energy  most hydrogen production induces environmental impacts  3

production edit 
main article  hydrogen production
because pure hydrogen does not occur naturally on earth in large quantities  it takes a substantial amount of energy in its industrial production  4  there are different ways to produce it  such as electrolysis and steam-methane reforming process  5  in electrolysis  electricity is run through water to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms  this method can use wind  solar  geothermal  hydro  fossil fuels  biomass  nuclear  and many other energy sources  2  obtaining hydrogen from this process is being studied as a viable way to produce it domestically at a low cost  steam-methane reforming  the current leading technology for producing hydrogen in large quantities  6  extracts the hydrogen from methane  however  this reaction causes a side production of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide  which are greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming  1 
general chemistry textbooks and laboratory manuals have students prepare hydrogen by reacting many metals  iron  zinc  and other metals but not copper  silver  platinum  or gold  with hydrochloric  sulfuric  phosphoric acid and other acids 
energy edit 
hydrogen is locked up in enormous quantities in water  hydrocarbons  and other organic matter  one of the challenges of using hydrogen as a fuel comes from being able to efficiently extract hydrogen from these compounds  currently  steam reforming  or combining high-temperature steam with natural gas  accounts for the majority of the hydrogen produced  7  hydrogen can also be produced from water through electrolysis  but this method is much more energy intensive  once extracted  hydrogen is an energy carrier  i e  a store for energy first generated by other means   the energy can be delivered to fuel cells and generate electricity and heat  or burned to run a combustion engine  8  in each case hydrogen is combined with oxygen to form water  the heat in a hydrogen flame is a radiant emission from the newly formed water molecules  the water molecules are in an excited state on initial formation and then transition to a ground state  the transition unleashing thermal radiation  when burning in air  the temperature is roughly 2000c  historically  carbon has been the most practical carrier of energy  as more energy is packed in fossil fuels than pure liquid hydrogen of the same volume  the carbon atoms have classic storage capabilities 9  and releases even more energy when burned with hydrogen  however  burning carbon base fuel and releasing its exhaust contributes to global warming due to the greenhouse effect of carbon gases  pure hydrogen is the smallest element and some of it will inevitably escape from any known container or pipe in micro amounts  yet simple ventilation could prevent such leakage from ever reaching the volatile 4  hydrogen-air mixture  so long as the product is in a gaseous or liquid state  pipes are a classic and very efficient form of transportation  pure hydrogen  though  causes metal to become brittle  suggesting metal pipes may not be ideal for hydrogen transport 
uses edit 
main article  hydrogen economy
hydrogen fuel can provide motive power for liquid-propellant rockets  cars  boats and airplanes  portable fuel cell applications or stationary fuel cell applications  which can power an electric motor  10  the problems of using hydrogen fuel in cars arise from the fact that hydrogen is difficult to store in either a high pressure tank or a cryogenic tank  11
