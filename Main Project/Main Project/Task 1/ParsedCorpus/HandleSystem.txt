the handle system is a technology specification for assigning  managing  and resolving persistent identifiers for digital objects and other resources on the internet  the protocols specified enable a distributed computer system to store identifiers  names  or handles  of digital resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary to locate  access  and otherwise make use of the resources  that information can be changed as needed to reflect the current state and or location of the identified resource without changing the handle 
the handle system was developed by bob kahn  co-inventor of the tcp ip protocols that underlie the operation of the internet  with support from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa at the corporation for national research initiatives  cnri   which continues to develop and manage it  the handle system is currently in use in several applications  1 
the handle system enables management of objects as first class entities  rather than as packets of bits with dependency on other attributes such as locations  it emerged as part of a wider framework for distributed digital object services 2  but has been used in independent applications  the system is designed to be scalable 3  to very large numbers of entities without performance degradation  to allow distributed administration  and to enable resolution to multiple pieces of current data  each of which may be separately managed   it also has further optional features such as public key infrastructure capability to enable trust applications 
resolution is the process in which an identifier is the input request to a network service to receive in return a specific output of one or more pieces of current information  state data  related to the identified entity  e g   a location  url   the domain name system resolves domain names meaningful to humans into numerical ip addresses  locations of file servers   the handle system is compatible with dns but does not necessarily require it  unlike persistent identifiers such as purls or arks which utilise domain names and are therefore ultimately constrained by them  other significant differences include the administrative granularity possible with the handle system  administrators can be different for each handle  and there can also be more than one per handle  and the option for extensible multiple data types to be assigned  4 
dns has well-recognised problems of security and updating which suggest that it will not be sufficient to assume that existing dns technology can simply be adapted to deal with new requirements  by explicitly separating names from all associated data  including location  the handle system addresses a key requirement of future internet architecture  a joint research project by the mit laboratory for computer science and air force research laboratory argued that  it is possible to separate the ideas of location and identity  both of which are represented by the ip address in today s internet      the resulting architecture facilitates mobility as well as solving other problems with today s network   5

specifications edit 
the handle system is defined in informational rfcs 3650  6  3651 7  and 3652 8  of the internet engineering task force  ietf   it includes an open set of protocols  a namespace  and a reference implementation of the protocols  handles resolve to typed data  documentation  software  and related information is provided by cnri on a dedicated website 9  each handle may have its own administrator s  and administration of these handles can be done in a distributed environment  the name-to-value bindings may also be secured  both via signatures to verify the data and via challenge response to verify the transmission of the data  allowing handles to be used in trust management applications  the syntax of the handle encompasses any unicode character and leaves the string construction to the assigner  thereby allowing inclusion of existing identifier strings if desired  
implementation of the handle system consists of local handle services  each of which is made up of one or more sites that provide the servers that store specific handles  the global handle registry is a unique local handle service which stores information on the prefixes  also known as naming authorities  within the handle system and can be queried to find out where specific handles are stored on other local handle services within this distributed system 
handles can be used natively  or expressed as uniform resource names  urns  or uniform resource identifiers  uris   although the handle system is not currently a registered stand-alone implementation of uri or urn  it is a part of the info uri 10  specification  rfc 4452  11  handles may also be expressed as uniform resource locators  urls   by the use of a http proxy server  12 
implementation edit 
the handle system website provides a series of implementation tools  notably the handle net software 13  and handle net client libraries  14  handle clients can be embedded in end user software  e g   a web browser  or in server software  e g   a web server  and extensions are already available for adobe acrobat 15  and firefox  16 
handle client software libraries are available in both c and java  some applications have developed specific add-on tools  e g   for the doi system  17 
the interoperable network of distributed handle resolver servers  also known as the proxy server system  are linked through a global resolver  which is one logical entity though physically decentralised and mirrored   users of handle system technology obtain a handle prefix created in the global handle registry  18  the global handle registry maintains and resolves the prefixes of locally maintained handle services  any local handle service can  therefore  resolve any handle through the global resolver 
handles  identifiers  are passed by a client  as a query of the naming authority prefix  to the handle system s global handle registry  ghr   the ghr responds by sending the client the location information for the relevant local handle service  which may consist of multiple servers in multiple sites   a query is then sent to the relevant server within the local handle service  the local handle service returns the information needed to acquire the resource  e g   a url which can then be turned into an http re-direct   note  if the client already has information on the appropriate lhs to query  the initial query to ghr is omitted 
though the original model from which the handle system derives dealt with management of digital objects  the handle system does not mandate any particular model of relationships between the identified entities  nor is it limited to identifying only digital objects  non-digital entities may be represented as a corresponding digital object for the purposes of digital object management  some care is needed in the definition of such objects and how they relate to non-digital entities  there are established models that can aid in such definitions  e g   functional requirements for bibliographic records  frbr   cidoc crm  and indecs content model  some applications have found it helpful to marry such a framework to the handle application  for example  the advanced distributed learning  adl  initiative 19  brings together handle system application with existing standards for distributed learning content  using a shareable content object reference model  scorm   20  and the digital object identifier  doi  system implementation of the handle system has adopted it together with the indecs framework to deal with semantic interoperability 
the handle system also makes explicit the importance of organizational commitment to a persistent identifier scheme  but does not mandate one model for ensuring such commitment  individual applications may choose to establish their own sets of rules and social infrastructure to ensure persistence  e g   when used in the dspace application  and the doi application   21 
design principles edit 
the handle system is designed to meet the following requirements to contribute to persistence 22  23 
the identifier string 
is not based on any changeable attributes of the entity  location  ownership  or any other attribute that may change without changing the referents identity  
is opaque  preferably a dumb number  a well known pattern invites assumptions that may be misleading  and meaningful semantics may not translate across languages and may cause trademark conflicts  
is unique within the system  to avoid collisions and referential uncertainty  
has optional  but nice to have  features that should be supported  human-readable cut-and-paste-able  embeddable  fits common systems  e g   uri specification  
the identifier resolution mechanism 
is reliable  using redundancy  no single points of failure  and fast enough to not appear broken  
is scalable  higher loads simply managed with more computers  
is flexible  can adapt to changing computing environments  useful to new applications  
is trusted  both resolution and administration have technical trust methods  an operating organization is committed to the long term  
builds on open architecture  encouraging the leverage efforts of a community in building applications on the infrastructure  
is transparent  users need not know the infrastructure details  
applications edit 
among the objects that are currently identified by handles are journal articles  technical reports  books  theses and dissertations  government documents  metadata  distributed learning content  and data sets  handles are being used in digital watermarking applications  grid applications  repositories  and more  although individual users may download and use the handle net software independently  many users have found it beneficial to collaborate in developing applications in a federation  using common policy or additional technology to provide shared services  as one of the first persistent identifier schemes  the handle system has been widely adopted by public and private institutions and proven over several years   see paradigm  persistent identifiers   24 
handle system applications may use handles as simple persistent identifiers  as most commonly used  to resolve to the current url of an object   or may choose to take advantage of other features  its support for the simultaneous return as output of multiple pieces of current information related to the object  in defined data structures  enables priorities to be established for the order in which the multiple resolutions will be used  handles can  therefore  resolve to different digital versions of the same content  to mirror sites  or to different business models  pay vs  free  secure vs  open  public vs  private   they can also resolve to different digital versions of differing content  such as a mix of objects required for a distance-learning course 
there are thousands of handle services running today  located in 71 countries  on 6 continents  over 1000 of them run at universities and libraries  handle services are being run by user federations  national laboratories  universities  computing centers  libraries  national and local   government agencies  contractors  corporations  and research groups  major publishers use the handle system for persistent identification of commercially traded and open access content through its implementation with the digital object identifier  doi  system 
the number of prefixes  which allow users to assign handles  is growing and stands at over 12,000 as of early 2014  there are six top-level global handle registry servers that receive  on average  68 million resolution requests per month  proxy servers known to cnri  passing requests to the system on the web  receive  on average  200 million resolution requests per month   statistics from handle quick facts   25 
cnri and itu  international telecommunication union  recently entered into an agreement to collaborate on use of the handle system  and the digital object architecture more generally  and are working on the specific details of that collaboration  in april 2009 itu listed the handle system as an  emerging trend   26 
licences and use policy edit 
handle system  handle net and global handle registry are trademarks of the corporation for national research initiatives  cnri   a non-profit research and development corporation in the usa  the handle system is the subject of patents by cnri  which licenses its handle system technology through a public license  27  similar to an open source license  in order to enable broader use of the technology  handle system infrastructure is supported by prefix registration and service fees  with the majority coming from single prefix holders  the largest current single contributor is the international doi foundation  the public license allows commercial and non-commercial use at low cost of both its patented technology and the reference implementation of the software  and allows the software to be freely embedded in other systems and products  a service agreement 28  is also available for users who intend to provide identifier and or resolution services using the handle system technology under the handle system public license

related technologies edit 
this section needs to be updated  please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information   august 2016 
the handle system is the first piece of a long-term digital object architecture  in january 2010 cnri released its general-purpose digital object repository software  29  which is the second major component of this architecture  more information 30  about the release  including protocol specification  source code and ready-to-use system  clients and utilities  is available  31  the third and final piece  the digital object registry  will be released shortly  when  
the continued use and evolution of the handle system is in no way dependent on these other components  but those already using handles may find them useful in small or large ways and both are  or soon will be  freely available under an open source style license
