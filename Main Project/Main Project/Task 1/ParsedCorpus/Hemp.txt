hemp grown for animal feed
hemp or industrial hemp  from old english hnep   1  typically found in the northern hemisphere  is a variety of the cannabis sativa plant species that is grown specifically for the industrial uses of its derived products  2  it is one of the fastest growing plants 3  and was one of the first plants to be spun into usable fiber 10,000 years ago  4  it can be refined into a variety of commercial items including paper  textiles  clothing  biodegradable plastics  paint  insulation  biofuel  food  and animal feed  5 
although cannabis as a drug and industrial hemp are both members of the species cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol  thc   they are distinct strains with unique biochemical compositions and uses  6  hemp has lower concentrations of thc and higher concentrations of cannabidiol  cbd   which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects  6  the legality of industrial hemp varies widely between countries  some governments regulate the concentration of thc and permit hemp that s bred with an especially low thc content  7  8

etymology edit 
further information  etymology of cannabis
the etymology is uncertain but there appears to be no common proto-indoeuropean source for the various forms of the word  the greek term knnabis is the oldest attested form  which may have been borrowed from an earlier scythian or thracian word  9  10  then it appears to have been borrowed into latin  and separately into slavic and from there into baltic  finnish  and germanic languages  11  following grimm s law  the  k  would have changed to  h  with the first germanic sound shift  9  12  after which it may have been adapted into the old english form  hnep  however  this theory assumes that hemp was not widely spread among different societies until after it was already being used as a psychoactive drug  which adams and mallory  1997  believe to be unlikely based on archaeological evidence  9  barber  1991  however  argued that the spread of the name  kannabis  was due to its historically more recent drug use  starting from the south  around iran  whereas non-thc varieties of hemp are older and prehistoric  11  another possible source of origin is assyrian qunnabu  which was the name for a source of oil  fiber  and medicine in the 1st millennium bc  11 
cognates of hemp in other germanic languages  include dutch hennep  danish and norwegian  hamp  german  hanf  and swedish  hampa  9 
uses edit 
hemp seed
hemp is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products including rope  clothes  food  paper  textiles  plastics  insulation and biofuel  5  the bast fibers can be used to make textiles that are 100  hemp  but they are commonly blended with other organic fibers such as flax  cotton or silk  to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings  the inner two fibers of the plant are more woody and typically have industrial applications  such as mulch  animal bedding and litter  when oxidized  commonly referred to as  drying    hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints  in creams as a moisturizing agent  for cooking  and in plastics  hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well  13  bettersourceneeded  a survey in 2003 showed that more than 95  of hemp seed sold in the european union was used in animal and bird feed  14  bettersourceneeded 
food edit 
hemp seed
hemp seeds can be eaten raw  ground into a meal  sprouted  or made into dried sprout powder  the leaves of the hemp plant can be consumed raw in salads  hemp can also be made into a liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as hemp milk  hemp juice  citation needed  and tea  15  hempseed oil is cold-pressed from the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids  16  in 2011  the u s  imported  11.5 million worth of hemp products  mostly driven by growth in demand for hemp seed and hemp oil for use as ingredients in foods such as granola  17 
in the uk  the department for environment  food and rural affairs  defra  treats hemp as a purely non-food crop  but with proper licensing and proof of less than 0.2  thc concentration  hemp seeds can be imported for sowing or for sale as a food or food ingredient  18  in the u s   imported hemp can be used legally in food products and as of 2000 update   was typically sold in health food stores or through mail order  16

storage edit 
hemp oil oxidizes and turns rancid within a short period of time if not stored properly  16  its shelf life is extended when stored in a dark airtight container and refrigerated 
fiber edit 
hemp stem showing fibers 
hemp fiber has been used extensively throughout history  with production climaxing soon after being introduced to the new world  items ranging from rope  to fabrics  to industrial materials were made from hemp fiber  hemp was often used to make sail canvas  and the word canvas derives from cannabis  22  23  today  a modest hemp fabric industry exists  and hemp fibers can be used in clothing  24  pure hemp has a texture similar to linen  25

processing edit 
traditionally the hemp stalks would be water-retted first before the fibers were beaten off the inner hurd by hand  a process known as scrutching  as mechanical technology evolved  separating the fiber from the core was accomplished by crushing rollers and brush rollers that would produce a nearly clean fiber  after the marijuana tax act was implemented in 1938  the technology for separating the fibers from the core remained  frozen in time  
only in 1997  starting with ireland  did the commonwealth countries and then other countries begin to legally grow industrial hemp again  reiterations of the 1930 s  decorticator  have been met with limited success  along with steam explosion and chemical processing known as thermomechanical pulping  citation needed 
building material edit 
main article  hempcrete
concrete-like blocks made with hemp and lime have been used as an insulating material for construction  such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements  they must be supported by a brick  wood  or steel frame  26  however hemp fibres are extremely strong and durable  and have been shown to be usable as a replacement for wood for many jobs including creating very durable and breathable homes 
the first example of the use of hempcrete was in 1986 in france with the renovation of the maison de la turque in nogent-sur-seine by the innovator charles rasetti  27  in the uk hemp lime was first used in 2000 for the construction of two test dwellings in haverhill  28  designed by modece architects  29  who pioneered hemp s use in uk construction  the hemp houses were monitored in comparison with other standard dwellings by bre  completed in 2009  the renewable house is one of the most technologically advanced made from hemp-based materials  30  the first us home made of hemp-based materials was completed in august 2010 in asheville  north carolina  31 
a panellized system of hemp-lime panels for use in building construction is currently under test in a european union funded research collaboration led by the university of bath  the panels are being designed to assure high quality construction  rapid on-site erection  optimal hygrothermal performance from day one and energy and resource efficient buildings  the 36-month-long work programme aims to refine product and manufacturing protocols  produce data for certification and marketing  warranty  insurance cover and availability of finance  it also includes the development of markets in britain  france and spain  32 
hemp is used as an internal plaster and is a mixture of hemp hurd  shive  mixed with larger proportions of a lime based binder  hemp plaster has insulative qualities  33

paper edit 
fiber sources edit 
see also  wood pulp and deinking
ancient sanskrit on hemp based paper  hemp fiber was commonly used in the production of paper from 200 bce to the late 1800 s 
before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles  called rags  the rags were from hemp  linen and cotton  38  a process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by german jurist justus claproth in 1774  38  today this method is called deinking  it was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers  38 
history and development edit 
wrapping paper with hemp fiber excavated from the han tomb of wu di  140-87 bc  at baqiao  xi an 
the first identified coarse paper  made from hemp  dates to the early western han dynasty  two hundred years before the nominal invention of papermaking by cai lun  who improved and standardized paper production using a range of inexpensive materials  including hemp ends  approximately 2000 years ago  39  recycled hemp clothing  rags and fishing nets were used as inputs for paper production 
the saint petersburg  russia  paper mill of goznak opened in 1818  it used hemp as its main input material  paper from the mill was used in the printing of  bank notes  stamped paper  credit bills  postal stamps  bonds  stocks  and other watermarked paper   40 
in 1916  u s  department of agriculture chief scientists lyster hoxie dewey and jason l  merrill created paper made from hemp pulp and concluded that paper from hemp hurds was  favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood   41  42  the chemical composition of hemp hurds is similar to that of wood  43  making hemp a good choice as a raw material for manufacturing paper  modern research has not confirmed the positive finding about hemp hurds from 1916  a later book about hemp and other fibers by the same l h  dewey 1943  have no words about hemp as a raw material for production of paper  44  dried hemp has about 57  cellulose  the principal ingredient in paper   compared to about 40-50  in wood  45  46  47  hemp also has the advantage of a lower lignin content  hemp contains only 5-24  lignin 48  against the 20-35  found in wood  49  this lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process  50  the actual production of hemp fiber in the u s continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons year  between 1934-35  the cultivation of hemp began to increase but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp  51  52 
contemporary edit 
currently there is a small niche market for hemp pulp  for example as cigarette paper  53  hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp  in 1994 there was no significant production of 100  true hemp paper  54  world hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05  of the world s annual pulp production volume  55  the total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons  53  this can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber  which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum  54  56  the cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp  55  mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the western world  and because hemp is harvested once a year  during august  citation needed  and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through  this storage requires a lot of  mostly manual  handling of the bulky stalk bundles  another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production  while the wood products industry uses nearly 100  of the fiber from harvested trees  only about 25  of the dried hemp stem  the bark  called bast  contains the long  strong fibers desirable for paper production  57  all this accounts for a high raw material cost  hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide  a process today also commonly used for wood pulp 
market share edit 
around the year 2000  the production quantity of flax and hemp pulp total 25000-30000 tons per year  having been produced from approximately 37000-45000 tonnes fibers  up to 80  of the produced pulp is used for specialty papers  including 95  of cigarette paper   only about 20  hemp fiber input goes into the standard pulp area and are here mostly in lower quality  untreated oakum high shive content added  wood pulps  with hemp pulp alone  the proportion of specialty papers probably at about 99   the market is considered saturated with little or no growth in this area  58  59

hemp jewelry is the product of knotting hemp twine through the practice of macram  hemp jewellery includes bracelets  necklaces  anklets  rings  watches and other adornments  some jewellery features beads made from glass  stone  wood and bones  the hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors  there are many different stitches used to create hemp jewellery  however  the half knot and full knot stitches are most common 
cordage edit 
hemp rope 
hemp rope was used in the age of sailing ships  though the rope had to be protected by tarring  since hemp rope has a propensity for breaking from rot  as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior  while seeming dry from the outside  60  tarring was a labor-intensive process  and earned sailors the nickname  jack tar   hemp rope was phased out when manila  which does not require tarring  became widely available  manila is sometimes referred to as manila hemp  but is not related to hemp  it is abac  a species of banana 
animal bedding edit 
hemp straw animal bedding 
hemp shives are the core of the stem  hemp hurds are broken parts of the core  in the eu  they are used for animal bedding  horses  for instance   or for horticultural mulch  61  industrial hemp is much more profitable if both fibers and shives  or even seeds  can be used 
water and soil purification edit 
hemp can be used as a  mop crop  to clear impurities out of wastewater  such as sewage effluent  excessive phosphorus from chicken litter  or other unwanted substances or chemicals  additionally hemp is being used to clean contaminants at the chernobyl nuclear disaster site  by way of a process which is known as phytoremediation - the process of clearing radioisotopes as well as a variety of other toxins from the soil  water  and air  62 
weed control edit 
main article  weed control organic methods
the dense growth of hemp helps kill weeds  even thistle 
hemp  because of its height  dense foliage and its high planting density as a crop  is a very effective and long used method of killing tough weeds in farming by minimizing the pool of weed seeds of the soil  63  using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides  to help gain organic certification and to gain the benefits of crop rotation  due to its rapid  dense growth characteristics  in some jurisdictions hemp is considered a prohibited noxious weed  much like scotch broom  citation needed 
biofuels edit 
biodiesel can be made from the oils in hemp seeds and stalks and alcohol fuel  ethanol or  less commonly  methanol  from the fermentation of the whole plant  biodiesel produced from hemp is sometimes known as  hempoline   64 
biodiesel sample 
filtered hemp oil can be used directly to power diesel engines  in 1892  rudolf diesel invented the diesel engine  which he intended to power  by a variety of fuels  especially vegetable and seed oils  which earlier were used for oil lamps  i e  the argand lamp   65  66  67 
production of vehicle fuel from hemp is very small  commercial biodiesel and biogas is typically produced from cereals  coconuts  palmseeds and cheaper raw materials like garbage  wastewater  dead plant and animal material  animal feces and kitchen waste  68 
cultivation edit 
hemp being harvested
hemp is usually planted between march and may in the northern hemisphere  between september and november in the southern hemisphere  69  it matures in about three to four months 
millennia of selective breeding have resulted in varieties that look quite different  also  breeding since circa 1930 has focused quite specifically on producing strains which would perform very poorly as sources of drug material  hemp grown for fiber is planted closely  resulting in tall  slender plants with long fibers   until the early 1900s industrial hemp was a valuable crop used all over the world for its strong fibers and oil seeds  today  however  the common perception of the industrial hemp plant is generally negative and associated with the drug marijuana  this perception is the legacy of a century of powerful influences construing hemp as a dangerous drug  even though it is not a drug and it has the potential to be a profitable alternative crop  in the united states  the public s perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product   70  in spite of its vital importance prior to world war ii  71  ideally  according to britain s department for environment  food and rural affairs  the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering  this early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality  72  in these strains of industrial hemp the tetrahydrocannabinol  thc  content would have been very low  70 
the seeds are sown from mid-april to mid-may with grain drills to 46cm sowing depth  hemp needs less fertilizer than corn does  a total of 60150kg of nitrogen  40140kg phosphorus  p2o5  and 75200kg of potassium  5  per acre for hemp fiber made before sowing and again later  maybe three to four weeks  when practiced  especially in france double use of fiber and seed fertilization with nitrogen doses up to 100kg   ha rather low  organic fertilizers such as manure can utilize industrial hemp well  neither weeds nor crop protection measures are necessary  70 
cultivars edit 
cannabis sativa stem
hemp strains uso-xx and zolotoniski-xx
a total of 26 varieties of hemp with low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol  thc  are certified by the european union  eu   73  they have  unlike other types  a very high fiber content of 30-40   in contrast to cannabis for medical use  varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.2  thc and they are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana  74  the most important cannabinoid in industrial hemp is cannabidiol  cbd  with a proportion of 1 to 5   citation needed 
the variety of appearances for cannabis  only c  sativa  left  is suited for industrial hemp  but it also has medicinal varieties 
cannabis sativa l  subsp  sativa var  sativa is the variety grown for industrial use  while c  sativa subsp  indica generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes  the major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance  and the amount of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol  thc  secreted in a resinous mixture by epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes  although they can also be distinguished genetically  75  oilseed and fiber varieties of cannabis approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug  not enough for any physical or psychological effects  typically  hemp contains below 0.3  thc  while cultivars of cannabis grown for medicinal or recreational use can contain anywhere from 2  to over 20   76 
harvesting edit 
industrial hempseed harvesting machine in france 
smallholder plots are usually harvested by hand  the plants are cut at 2 to 3cm above the soil and left on the ground to dry  mechanical harvesting is now common  using specially adapted cutter-binders or simpler cutters 
the cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry for up to four days  this was traditionally followed by retting  either water retting  the bundled hemp floats in water  or dew retting  the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew  and by molds and bacterial action  
location and crop rotation edit 
hemp maze in france
for profitable hemp farming  particularly deep  humus-rich  nutrient-rich soil with controlled water flow is preferable  water logged acidic  compressed or extremely light  sandy  soils primarily affect the early development of plants  citation needed  steep and high altitudes of more than 400 m above sea level are best avoided  hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to -5 degrees c  citation needed  seeds can germinate down to 1-3 degrees  citation needed  hemp needs a lot of heat  so earlier varieties come to maturation  the water requirement is 300-500 l   kg dry matter  citation needed  up to 3 feet growing roots into the soil can also use water supplies from deeper soil layers  worth noting is that the water requirement of hemp is at least 14 times lower than that of cotton which takes between 7 000-29 000 l kg  according to wwf  citation needed 
hemp benefits crops grown after it  for this reason  it is generally grown before winter cereals  advantageous changes are high weed suppression  soil loosening by the large hemp root system and the positive effect on soil tilth  since hemp is very self-compatible  it can also be grown several years in a row in the same fields  monoculture  
diseases edit 
main article  list of hemp diseases
hemp plants can be vulnerable to various pathogens  including bacteria  fungi  nematodes  viruses and other miscellaneous pathogens  such diseases often lead to reduced fiber quality  stunted growth  and death of the plant  these diseases rarely affect the yield of a hemp field  so hemp production is not traditionally dependent on the use of pesticides 
environmental impact edit 
hemp is considered by a 1998 study in environmental economics to be environmentally friendly due to a decrease of land use and other environmental impacts  indicating a possible decrease of ecological footprint in a us context compared to typical benchmarks  77  a 2010 study  however  that compared the production of paper specifically from hemp and eucalyptus concluded that  industrial hemp presents higher environmental impacts than eucalyptus paper   however  the article also highlights that  there is scope for improving industrial hemp paper production   78  hemp is also claimed to require few pesticides and no herbicides  and it has been called a carbon negative raw material  79  80  results indicate that high yield of hemp may require high total nutrient levels  field plus fertilizer nutrients  similar to a high yielding wheat crop  81

australia edit 
in the australian states of tasmania  victoria  queensland and  most recently  new south wales  the state governments have issued licences to grow hemp for industrial use  the first to initiate modern research into the potential of cannabis was the state of tasmania pioneered the licensing of hemp during the early 1990s  the state of victoria was an early adopter in 1998  and has reissued the regulation in 2008  88 
queensland has allowed industrial production under licence since 2002  89  where the issuance is controlled under the drugs misuse act 1986  90  most recently  new south wales now issues licences 91  under a law  the hemp industry regulations act 2008  no 58   that came into effect as of 6 november 2008  92 
canada edit 
commercial production  including cultivation  of industrial hemp has been permitted in canada since 1998 under licenses and authorization issued by health canada  9,725 ha in 2004  5450 ha in 2009   93 
in the early 1990s  industrial hemp agriculture in north america began with the hemp awareness committee at the university of manitoba  the committee worked with the provincial government to get research and development assistance  and was able to obtain test plot permits from the canadian government  their efforts led to the legalization of industrial hemp  hemp with only minute amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol  in canada and the first harvest in 1998  94  95 
the cultivated area for hemp in the prairie provinces of canada is stable at about 90,000 acres  36,000ha  over 2013-15  96 
france edit 
industrial hemp production in france
france is the world s biggest producer with 8,000 hectares cultivated  citation needed  70-80  of the hemp fibre produced in europe in 2003 was used for specialty pulp for cigarette papers and technical applications  about 15  is used in the automotive sector and 5-6  were used for insulation mats  approximately 95  of hurds were used as animal bedding  while almost 5  were used in the building sector  14  in 2010/2011  a total of 11 000 ha was cultivated with hemp in the eu  a decline compared with previous year  85  97 
russia and ukraine edit 
harvesting hemp in the ussr  1956
from the 1950s to the 1980s  the soviet union was the world s largest producer of hemp  3,000km in 1970   the main production areas were in ukraine  98  the kursk and orel regions of russia  and near the polish border  since its inception in 1931  the hemp breeding department at the institute of bast crops in hlukhiv  glukhov   ukraine  has been one of the world s largest centers for developing new hemp varieties  focusing on improving fiber quality  per-hectare yields  and low thc content  99  100 
after the collapse of the soviet union  the commercial cultivation of hemp declined sharply  however  it is estimated that at least 2.5 million acres of hemp grows wild in the russian far east and black sea regions  101 
united kingdom edit 
in the united kingdom  cultivation licences are issued by the home office under the misuse of drugs act 1971  when grown for non-drug purposes  hemp is referred to as industrial hemp  and a common product is fibre for use in a wide variety of products  as well as the seed for nutritional aspects and for the oil  feral hemp or ditch weed is usually a naturalized fibre or oilseed strain of cannabis that has escaped from cultivation and is self-seeding  102 
united states edit 
hemp was made illegal to grow without a permit in the u s  under the controlled substances act passed in 1970 because of its relation to marijuana  17  and any imported hemp products must meet a zero tolerance level  103  some states have made the cultivation of industrial hemp legal  but farmers in many states have not yet begun to grow it because of resistance from the federal drug enforcement administration  104  in 2013  after the legalization of cannabis in the state  several farmers in colorado planted and harvested several acres of hemp  bringing in the first hemp crop in the united states in over half a century  105  colorado  106  vermont  california  and north dakota have passed laws enabling hemp licensure  all four states are waiting for permission to grow hemp from the dea  currently  107  oregon has licensed industrial hemp as of august 2009 update   108  congress included a provision in the agricultural act of 2014 that allowed colleges and state agencies to grow and conduct research on hemp in states where it is legal  17 
as of 2015 the hemp industry estimated that annual sales of hemp products were around us 580 million annually  hemp seeds have been the major force driving this growth  109 
yet  even with this progress  hemp businesses seem to face difficulty expanding in the us as they face challenges in traditional marketing and sales approaches  110  according to the case study done by forbes  hemp businesses and startups  such as ministry of hemp  111  have had difficulty marketing and selling non-psychoactive hemp products  as social media and financial institutions refuse to distinguish between hemp and marijuana 
history edit 
yangshao culture  ca  4800 bce  amphora with impressed hemp cord design
radical 200   or m   the chinese character for hemp  depicts two plants under a shelter  the use of hemp in taiwan dates back at least 10,000 years  112 
hemp is one of the earliest domesticated plants known  113  it has been cultivated by many civilizations for over 12,000 years  114  hemp use archaeologically dates back to the neolithic age in china  with hemp fiber imprints found on yangshao culture pottery dating from the 5th millennium bc  112  115  the chinese later used hemp to make clothes  shoes  ropes  and an early form of paper  112  the classical greek historian herodotus  ca  480 bc  reported that the inhabitants of scythia would often inhale the vapors of hemp-seed smoke  both as ritual and for their own pleasurable recreation  116 
textile expert elizabeth wayland barber summarizes the historical evidence that cannabis sativa   grew and was known in the neolithic period all across the northern latitudes  from europe  germany  switzerland  austria  romania  ukraine  to east asia  tibet and china    but   textile use of cannabis sativa does not surface for certain in the west until relatively late  namely the iron age   117   i strongly suspect  however  that what catapulted hemp to sudden fame and fortune as a cultigen and caused it to spread rapidly westwards in the first millennium b c  was the spread of the habit of pot-smoking from somewhere in south-central asia  where the drug-bearing variety of the plant originally occurred  the linguistic evidence strongly supports this theory  both as to time and direction of spread and as to cause   118 
jews living in palestine in the 2nd century were familiar with the cultivation of hemp  as witnessed by a reference to it in the mishna  kil ayim 2 5  as a variety of plant  along with arum  that sometimes takes as many as three years to grow from a seedling  in late medieval germany and italy  hemp was employed in cooked dishes  as filling in pies and tortes  or boiled in a soup  119  hemp in later europe was mainly cultivated for its fibers  and was used for ropes on many ships  including those of christopher columbus  the use of hemp as a cloth was centered largely in the countryside  with higher quality textiles being available in the towns 
cannabis sativa from vienna dioscurides  512 ad 
the spaniards brought hemp to the western hemisphere and cultivated it in chile starting about 1545  120  however  in may 1607   hempe  was among the crops gabriel archer observed being cultivated by the natives at the main powhatan village  where richmond  virginia is now situated  121  and in 1613  samuell argall reported wild hemp  better than that in england  growing along the shores of the upper potomac  as early as 1619  the first virginia house of burgesses passed an act requiring all planters in virginia to sow  both english and indian  hemp on their plantations  122  the puritans are first known to have cultivated hemp in new england in 1645  120 
united states  marihuana  production permit  in the united states  hemp cultivation is legally prohibited  but during world war ii farmers were encouraged to grow hemp for cordage  to replace manila hemp previously obtained from japanese-controlled areas  the u s  government produced a film explaining the uses of hemp  called hemp for victory 
george washington pushed for the growth of hemp and even grew hemp himself  as it was a cash crop commonly used to make rope and fabric  in may 1765 he noted in his diary about the sowing of seeds each day until mid-april  then he recounts the harvest in october which he grew 27 bushels that year 
there is some speculation that george washington smoked the flower of the cannabis plant in order to achieve a recreational high   like all farmers  washington probably sampled the quality and potency of what he grew  and he may have used this hemp to treat his chronic tooth aches    71  but there is no evidence in any of his writings that he grew hemp for anything other than industrial purposes  it is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from washington s diary  which reads  began to seperate  sic  the male from the female hemp at do  rather too late  is evidence that he was trying to grow female plants for the thc found in the flowers  however  the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that  this may arise from their  the male  being coarser  and the stalks larger  123  in subsequent days  he describes soaking the hemp 124   to make the fibers usable  and harvesting the seeds  125  suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes  not recreational 
george washington also imported the indian hemp plant from asia  which was used for fiber and  by some growers  for intoxicating resin production  in a letter to william pearce who managed the plants for him washington says   what was done with the indian hemp plant from last summer  it ought  all of it  to be sown again  that not only a stock of seed sufficient for my own purposes might have been raised  but to have disseminated seed to others  as it is more valuable than common hemp   citation needed 
additional presidents known to have farmed hemp include thomas jefferson  126  james madison  james monroe  andrew jackson  zachary taylor  and franklin pierce   127 
historically  hemp production had made up a significant portion of antebellum kentucky s economy  before the american civil war  many slaves worked on plantations producing hemp  128 
in 1937  the marihuana tax act of 1937 was passed in the united states  levying a tax on anyone who dealt commercially in cannabis  hemp  or marijuana  the passing of the act to destroy the us hemp industry has been disputed to involve businessmen andrew mellon  randolph hearst and the du pont family  129  130  131 
one claim is that hearst believed dubious  discuss  that his extensive timber holdings were threatened by the invention of the decorticator which he feared would allow hemp to become a cheap substitute for the paper pulp used for newspaper  129  132  historical research indicates this fear was unfounded because improvements of the decorticators in the 1930s  machines that separated the fibers from the hemp stem  could not make hemp fiber a cheaper substitute for fibers from other sources  further  decorticators did not perform satisfactorily in commercial production  44  129 
another claim is that mellon  secretary of the treasury and the wealthiest man in america at that time  had invested heavily in dupont s new synthetic fiber  nylon  and believed dubious  discuss  that the replacement of the traditional resource  hemp  was integral to the new product s success  129  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  the company dupont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp  nylon became immediately a scarce commodity  clarification needed  nylon had characteristics that could be used for toothbrushes  sold from 1938  and very thin nylon fiber could compete with silk and rayon in various textiles normally not produced from hemp fiber  such as very thin stockings for women  44  140  141  142  143 
play media
hemp for victory  a short documentary produced by the united states department of agriculture during world war 2
hemp was used extensively by the united states during world war ii to make uniforms  canvas  and rope  144  much of the hemp used was cultivated in kentucky and the midwest  during world war ii  the u s  produced a short 1942 film  hemp for victory  promoting hemp as a necessary crop to win the war 
historical cultivation edit 
hemp has been grown for millennia in asia and the middle east for its fibre  commercial production of hemp in the west took off in the eighteenth century  but was grown in the sixteenth century in eastern england  145  because of colonial and naval expansion of the era  economies needed large quantities of hemp for rope and oakum  in the early 1940s  world production of hemp fiber ranged from 250 000 to 350 000 metric tonnes  russia was the biggest producer  44 
in western europe  the cultivation of hemp was not legally banned by the 1930s  but the commercial cultivation stopped by then  due to decreased demand compared to increasingly popular artificial fibers  146  speculation about the potential for commercial cultivation of hemp in large quantities has been criticized due to successful competition from other fibers for many products  the world production of hemp fiber fell from over 300,000 metric tons 1961 to about 75,000 metric tons in the early 1990s and has after that been stable at that level  147 
japan edit 
japanese shinto shrine with rope made of hemp
in japan  hemp was historically used as paper and a fiber crop  there is archaeological evidence cannabis was used for clothing and the seeds were eaten in japan back to the jmon period  10,000 to 300 bce   many kimono designs portray hemp  or asa  japanese     as a beautiful plant  in 1948  marijuana was restricted as a narcotic drug  the ban on marijuana imposed by the united states authorities was alien to japanese culture  as the drug had never been widely used in japan before  though these laws against marijuana are some of the world s strictest  allowing five years imprisonment for possession of the drug  they exempt hemp growers  whose crop is used to make robes for buddhist monks and loincloths for sumo wrestlers  because marijuana use in japan has doubled in the past decade  these exemptions have recently been called into question  148 
portugal edit 
the cultivation of hemp in portuguese lands began around the fourteenth century onwards  it was raw material for the preparation of rope and plugs for the portuguese ships  colonies for factories for the production of flax hemp  such as the royal flax hemp factory in brazil 
after the restoration of independence in 1640  in order to recover the ailing portuguese naval fleet  were encouraged its cultivation as the royal decree of d  john iv in 1656  at that time its cultivation was carried out in trs-os-montes  zone tower moncorvo  more precisely in vilaria valley  fertile land for any crop irrigation  and a very large area  flat and very fertile culture still wide until the last century grew up tobacco  a plant that needs a large space to expand and grow  the area lies in the valley of serra de bornes 
in 1971  the cultivation of hemp became illegal  and the production was substantially reduced  because of eu regulations 1308/70  619/71 and 1164/89  this law was revoked  for some certified seed varieties   149
