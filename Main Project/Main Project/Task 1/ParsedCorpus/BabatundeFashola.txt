the eko mega city project edit 
see also  eko atlantic city
the biggest task babatunde raji fashola faced in office as governor of lagos state is his visionary project to transform lagos into a mega city  9  the first of its kind in lagosian history  although initialised under the former governor  bola ahmed tinubu  in june 2002  10  the mega project task accelerated under fashola s governorship  both private and public sectors are involved in fulfilling the project  10  11 
newly added toll gates and roads at the lekki-p expressway 
the crucial part of the mega city project is the rehabilitation of lagos  infrastructures and districts  formerly taken care of by the federal government  they were immediately neglected  as abuja was declared nigeria s new capital since 1991  10  according to lagos rail mass transit  proposed light railways will be consisted of the outskirt blue-line and inner red-line destinations  12  as part of the project  the badagry expressway  which links lagos directly to the south-eastern border of benin republic  is currently being rehabilitated by various contractors  13  with brt and railway networks being established  14 
another ambition is to recover lands at victoria island  being lost to erosion for decades  15  this artificial terrain is the location of the proposed eko atlantic city  this is also to support housing project that would accommodate up to 25 million lagosians by 2015  a population growth from 15 million that could turn lagos into the world s third largest city  16

haiti earthquake fund-raising edit 
see also  2010 haiti earthquake
as soon as haiti was struck by a magnitude 7.0 mw earthquake  babatunde fashola launched an appeal to raise up to one million us dollars  the funds raised were used to assist the victims of the haiti quake  as this was in place  the speaker of the lagos state house of assembly  mr  adeyemi ikuforiji  said nigerians should be prepared in events of natural disasters  18 
water safety edit 
in may 2014  fashola announced the compulsory use of life jackets on lagos waterways  19  in a 2012 accident  ten children from ijora awori  lagos state  drowned while they were being ferried to school  because they were not wearing life jackets  20 
political limbo edit 
by december 2009  there had been rumours and speculation by news media that babatunde fashola was subjected to a possible impeachment from within  primarily because of disagreements with the former governor  ironically  a similar situation played itself out between tinubu and femi pedro  tinubu s former deputy governor  in the run-up to the gubernatorial elections in 2007  it is believed that there was a dispute over fashola s 2.1 billion naira worth of commission with the former governor  bola ahmed tinubu  21  although both fashola and the lagos state house of assembly had earlier denied such plot ever took place  22   23 
but in late january 2010  the lagos state house of assembly launched an investigation into possible mishandling of tax payers  money by fashola  mainly on the ongoing mega city project  24  the accusations range from importing of palm trees from niger  for gardening projects within a rain forest state  to improper usage of contract money involving one of lagos state s contractors  25  the group carrying out the investigation was known as the  true face of lagos   the final reports were due to be submitted on 15 february 2010  24  26  but the true face of lagos was later abolished  there were attempts to re-launch the probes through a petition  27  but they were again being turned down by the court  28 
the action congress of nigeria  acn  finally ended months of speculation over the second term ambition of the lagos state governor babatunde raji fashola  san   when it endorsed him as the party s sole candidate for the 2011 governorship election 
on wednesday  at the party s secretariat  in ikeja lagos  fashola s predecessor  alhaji bola ahmed tinubu who people perceived to be at the centre of the uncertainty over the political future of fashola announced the decision of the party 
before thousands of the party supporters  tinubu  who flew into lagos from abuja because of the emergency stakeholders  meeting raised babatunde fashola s hand and said  today  by the power conferred on me by the acn  in consultation and in agreement with all our party leaders throughout the state and at the national level  i am announcing to you  the final endorsement of raji babatunde fashola for the 2011 election  citation needed  he was re-elected on 26 april 2011 by a massive landslide victory  in lagos  south-west nigeria and nigeria as a whole  babatunde raji fashola remains a reference point in 21st century governance  3
