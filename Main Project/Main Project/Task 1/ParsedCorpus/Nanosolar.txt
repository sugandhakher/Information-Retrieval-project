nanosolar was a developer of solar power technology  based in san jose  ca  nanosolar developed and briefly commercialized a low-cost printable solar cell manufacturing process  the company started selling thin-film cigs panels mid-december 2007  and planned to sell them at 99 cents per watt  much below the market at the time  however  prices for solar panels made of crystalline silicon declined significantly during the following years  reducing most of nanosolar s cost advantage  2  3  4  by february 2013 nanosolar had laid off 75  of its work force  5  nanosolar began auctioning off its equipment in august 2013  6  co-founder of nanosolar martin roscheisen stated on his personal blog that nanosolar  ultimately failed commercially   and that he would not enter this industry again because of slow-development cycle  complex production problems and the impact of cheap chinese solar power production  7  nanosolar ultimately produced less than 50 mw of solar power capacity despite having raised more than  400 million in investment  8

financial backers and manufacturing edit 
nanosolar was started in 2002 and is headquartered in san jose  california  the company has received financing from a number of technology investors including benchmark capital  mohr davidow ventures  and larry page and sergey brin  the founders of google  nanosolar received the largest amount in a round of venture capital technology funding amongst united states companies during q2 2006  with 100 million usd of new funding secured  9  it also received the largest amount of financing of any private company in 2008  usd 300 million in q1  
nanosolar planned to build a large production facility in san jose  and in germany at luckenwalde  berlin   10  with an annual capacity of 430 megawatts  several german energy and venture capital companies have heavily invested in this company as a consequence of the favourable economics for solar energy in germany due to government subsidies  11 
on december 12  2007 the company announced 12  that it had started solar cell production in its san jose factory  with its german facility slated to go into operation in the 1st quarter of 2008  the company said in 2006 that the san jose factory  when fully built  would have the capacity to produce 430 megawatts of cells each year  13 
on december 18  2007 the company began shipping its first solar panels for a one-megawatt municipal power plant in germany  14 
as of 2008 nanosolar had raised about 500 million usd in total funding by private investors benchmark capital  mitsui ventures  mohr davidow ventures  onpoint  capricorn management  firelake capital management  glg partners  grazia equity  swiss re  beck energy  omidyar network  lone pine capital  energy capital partners  riverstone holdings  edf ventures  the skoll foundation  eds  hp  and the carlyle group  15 
on february 17  2012 nanosolar announced they had achieved 115mw capacity   20 million in additional funding to further expand manufacturing capacity and a nrel thin-film solar aperture efficiency of 17.1   16  this capacity is just over one quarter of the 430 megawatts predicted five years previously 
management edit 
on jan  19 2012 former evp of engineering   operations eugenia corrales was named ceo following ceo geoff tate returning to retirement  tate had been ceo of nanosolar since march 22  2010 having been hired out of retirement as an interim ceo for his experience in leading a company into volume production as ceo of rambus  17  tate replaced co-founder martin roscheisen who had been the company s chairman   ceo for the past eight years  no reason was given for roscheisen s exit  18 
on june 25  2012  nano solar hired 3 new sales   marketing executives  stephan hansen  executive vice president of worldwide sales  roy shaw  head of north america sales and stefan zschiegner  vice president of worldwide marketing  prior to joining nanosolar  hansen led the european sales organization of first solar for more than seven years  shaw brings over 25 years of sales management experience in the solar industry  he most recently was director of usa sales at jinko solar  a global pv manufacturer  producing crystalline ingots  wafers  cells  and mono- and multi- crystalline pv panels  prior to jinko solar  he was head of western sales at suntech solar corp   a global producer of silicon solar modules  zschiegner most recently was vice president of global product management and applications at first solar  where he focused on solutions for emerging markets  balance-of-system and module product management 
on sep  11  2012  nanosolar appointed karl steigele to the position of president   coo  eugenia corrales left the company to pursue other ventures  before joining nanosolar  steigele spent more than 30 years in international management and consulting at ibm  where he worked with fortune 500 global manufacturing companies  including intel  hitachi  abb  thomson  siemens  sony and mckesson  among others 
technology edit 
the company used thin film technology to manufacture cigs solar cells  that use a semiconductor material made of copper  indium  gallium and selenium  and achieved an efficiency of up to 19.9  in laboratory samples at the time  19 
the company s technology gained early industry recognition with the presentation of a small times magazine award at a leading nanotech business event in 2005  20  technical details of nanosolar s manufacturing techniques have been disclosed in patent applications  21  some information about their process has become available in a scientific american article  in german   22  these details involve a semiconductor ink that it claims will enable it to produce solar cells with a basic printing process  rather than using slow and expensive high-vacuum based thin-film deposition processes  the ink is deposited on a flexible substrate  the paper   and then nanocomponents in the ink align themselves properly via molecular self-assembly 
nanosolar s solar cells have been verified by nrel to be as efficient as 14.6  in 2006  22  15.3  in 2009  23  and 17.1  in 2011  24  efficiencies for current production panels are said to be 8-9   with plans to submit panels with 10-11  efficiency for iec certification in the fall of 2010  25 
in september 2009  nanosolar announced the launch of production at a rate of 640 mw annually  26  however  ramp-up to volume production after the announcement took an additional six months  25  limiting actual production in 2009 to an estimated 4 mw  27  and as of august 2010 the plant was still ramping up toward its announced capacity  28  since the hiring of new ceo geoff tate  the company has declined to discuss its actual manufacturing capacity  25  27  but has said that its target for 2010 is to ship panels for  several     megawatt-size projects  and   build  panels for projects that have been identified that can help build the case for an operating history and bankability in 2011   25 
nanosolar has developed a suite of in-house capabilities for creating nanostructured components based on various patented and patent-pending techniques  it uses nanostructured components as the basis for creating printable semiconductors  printable transparent electrodes  novel forms of advanced nanocomposite solar-cell design and powerful new forms of barrier films  29 
according to the company   leveraging recent science advances in nanostructured materials  nanosolar has developed a proprietary ink that makes it possible to simply print the semiconductor of a high-performance solar cell  this ink is based on nanosolar developing various proprietary forms of nanoparticles and associated organic dispersion chemistry and processing techniques suitable for delivering a semiconductor of high electronic quality   30  31 
two advantages over earlier technologies is that a printing process is quick and also makes it easy to deposit a uniform layer of the ink  resulting in a layer with the correct ratio of elements everywhere on the substrate  also  the ink is printed only where needed  so there is less waste of material  last  the substrate material on which the ink is printed is much more conductive and less expensive than the stainless steel substrates that are often used in thin-film solar panels 
these solar cells successfully blend the needs for efficiency  low cost  and longevity and will be easy to install due to their flexibility and light weight  estimates by nanosolar of the cost of these cells fall roughly between 1/10 and 1/5 32  the industry standard per kilowatt  however  solar module prices have fallen by 60  since that prediction in 2006  33 
the company implies that their solar cells can last more than 25 years by saying they  achieve a durability compatible with our 25-year warranty   34  they recently commissioned a study by black and veatch that finds their 25-year warranty to be compatible with their module design  25
