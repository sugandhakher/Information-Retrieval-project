carnot s theorem  developed in 1824 by nicolas lonard sadi carnot  also called carnot s rule  is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any heat engine can obtain  the efficiency of a carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs 
carnot s theorem states 
all heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a carnot heat engine operating between the same reservoirs 
every carnot heat engine between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient  regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details 
the formula for this maximum efficiency is

where tc is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir  th is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir  and the efficiency
 
  displaystyle  eta  
is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir 
based on modern thermodynamics  carnot s theorem is a result of the second law of thermodynamics  historically  however  it was based on contemporary caloric theory and preceded the establishment of the second law  1

proof edit 
an impossible situation  a heat engine cannot drive a less efficient  reversible  heat engine without violating the second law of thermodynamics 
the proof of the carnot theorem is a proof by contradiction  or reductio ad absurdum  as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature  the heat engine with more efficiency  
 
m
  displaystyle  eta   m  
  is driving a heat engine with less efficiency  
 
l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
   causing the latter to act as a heat pump  this pair of engines receives no outside energy  and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir  however  if
 
m
 
 
l
  displaystyle  eta   m   eta   l  
  then the net heat flow would be backwards  i e   into the hot reservoir

it is generally agreed that this is impossible because it violates the second law of thermodynamics 
we begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure  first  we must point out an important caveat  the engine with less efficiency  
 
l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
  is being driven as a heat pump  and therefore must be a reversible engine  if the less efficient engine  
 
l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
  is not reversible  then the device could be built  but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid 
by restricting our discussion to cases where engine  
 
l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
  has less efficiency than engine  
 
m
  displaystyle  eta   m  
   we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols 
q
  displaystyle q 
and
w
  displaystyle w 
represent non-negative quantities  since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where
 
l
 
 
m
  displaystyle  eta   l  leqslant  eta   m  
   conservation of energy demands that for each engine  the energy which enters

  must equal the energy which exits

it may seem odd that a hypothetical heat pump with low efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics  but the figure of merit for refrigerator units is not efficiency

  a reversible heat engine with low thermodynamic efficiency

delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump 
having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct  carnot s theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines  3 
reversible engines edit 
to see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs
t
1
  displaystyle t  1  
and
t
2
  displaystyle t  2  
must have the same efficiency  assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of
 
  displaystyle  eta  
  and let the more efficient engine  m  drive the less efficient engine  l  as a heat pump  as the figure shows  this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy  which violates the second law of thermodynamics  therefore both  reversible  heat engines have the same efficiency  and we conclude that 
all reversible engines that operate between the same two heat reservoirs have the same efficiency 
this is an important result because it helps establish the clausius theorem  which implies that the change in entropy is unique for all reversible processes   4

over all paths  from a to b in v-t space   if this integral were not path independent  then entropy  s  would lose its status as a state variable  5 
irreversible engines edit 
if one of the engines is irreversible  it must be the  m  engine  placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible  l  engine  but if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine   i e   if
 
m
 
 
l
  displaystyle  eta   m   eta   l  
   then the second law of thermodynamics is violated  and  since the carnot cycle represents a reversible engine  we have the first part of carnot s theorem 
no irreversible engine is more efficient than the carnot engine operating between the same two reservoirs 
definition of thermodynamic temperature edit

the efficiency of the engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or

where wcy is the work done per cycle  thus  the efficiency depends only on qc qh 
because all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient  any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t2 must have the same efficiency  meaning  the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only

in addition  a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles  one between t1 and another  intermediate  temperature t2  and the second between t2andt3  this can only be the case if

therefore  if thermodynamic temperature is defined by

and the reference temperature t1 has the value 273.16   of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be usedthe choice here corresponds to the kelvin scale

since fuel cells and batteries can generate useful power when all components of the system are at the same temperature  
t
 
t

t

   they are clearly not limited by carnot s theorem  which states that no power can be generated when
t
h
 
t
c
  displaystyle t  h  t  c  
  this is because carnot s theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work  whereas fuel cells and batteries instead convert chemical energy to work  6  nevertheless  the second law of thermodynamics still provides restrictions on fuel cell and battery energy conversion  7
