in geology  the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet or natural satellite  which is chemically distinct from the underlying mantle  the crusts of earth  the moon  mercury  venus  mars  io  and other planetary bodies have been generated largely by igneous processes  and these crusts are richer in incompatible elements than their respective mantles

earth s crust
the internal structure of earth
the crust of the earth is composed of a great variety of igneous  metamorphic  and sedimentary rocks  the crust is underlain by the mantle  the upper part of the mantle is composed mostly of peridotite  a rock denser than rocks common in the overlying crust  the boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the mohorovii discontinuity  a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity  the crust occupies less than 1  of earth s volume  1 
the oceanic crust of the sheet is different from its continental crust 
the oceanic crust is 5km  3mi  to 10km  6mi  thick 2  and is composed primarily of basalt  diabase  and gabbro 
the continental crust is typically from 30km  20mi  to 50km  30mi  thick and is mostly composed of slightly less dense rocks than those of the oceanic crust  some of these less dense rocks  such as granite  are common in the continental crust but rare to absent in the oceanic crust 
both the continental and oceanic crust  float  on the mantle  because the continental crust is thicker  it extends both to greater elevations and greater depth than the oceanic crust  the slightly lower density of felsic continental rock compared to basaltic oceanic rock contributes to the higher relative elevation of the top of the continental crust  as the top of the continental crust reaches elevations higher than that of the oceanic  water runs off the continents and collects above the oceanic crust  because of the change in velocity of seismic waves it is believed that beneath continents at a certain depth continental crust  sial  becomes close in its physical properties to oceanic crust  sima   and the transition zone is referred to as the conrad discontinuity 
the temperature of the crust increases with depth  reaching values typically in the range from about 200c  392f  to 400c  752f  at the boundary with the underlying mantle  the crust and underlying relatively rigid uppermost mantle make up the lithosphere  because of convection in the underlying plastic  although non-molten  upper mantle and asthenosphere  the lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move  the temperature increases by as much as 30c  about 50f  for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust  but the geothermal gradient is smaller in deeper crust  3 
plates in the crust of earth
partly by analogy to what is known about the moon  earth is considered to have differentiated from an aggregate of planetesimals into its core  mantle and crust within about 100 million years of the formation of the planet  4.6 billion years ago  the primordial crust was very thin and was probably recycled by much more vigorous plate tectonics and destroyed by significant asteroid impacts  which were much more common in the early stages of the solar system 
earth has probably always had some form of basaltic crust  but the age of the oldest oceanic crust today is only about 200 million years  in contrast  the bulk of the continental crust is much older  the oldest continental crustal rocks on earth have ages in the range from about 3.7 to 4.28 billion years  4  5  and have been found in the narryer gneiss terrane in western australia  in the acasta gneiss in the northwest territories on the canadian shield  and on other cratonic regions such as those on the fennoscandian shield  some zircon with age as great as 4.3 billion years has been found in the narryer gneiss terrane 
the average age of the current earth s continental crust has been estimated to be about 2.0 billion years  6  most crustal rocks formed before 2.5 billion years ago are located in cratons  such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in earth and so are not readily destroyed by subduction  formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense orogeny  these periods coincide with the formation of the supercontinents such as rodinia  pangaea and gondwana  the crust forms in part by aggregation of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts  and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle 
composition
main articles  abundance of elements in earth s crust and goldschmidt classification
abundance  atom fraction  of the chemical elements in earth s upper continental crust as a function of atomic number  the rarest elements in the crust  shown in yellow  are not the heaviest  but are rather the siderophile  iron-loving  elements in the goldschmidt classification of elements  these have been depleted by being relocated deeper into earth s core  their abundance in meteoroid materials is higher  additionally  tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides 
the continental crust has an average composition similar to that of andesite  7  continental crust is enriched in incompatible elements compared to the basaltic ocean crust and much enriched compared to the underlying mantle  although the continental crust comprises only about 0.6 weight percent of the silicate on earth  it contains 20  to 70  of the incompatible elements

moon s crust
main article  geology of the moon
a theoretical protoplanet named  theia  is thought to have collided with the forming earth  and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the moon  as the moon formed  the outer part of it is thought to have been molten  a lunar magma ocean  plagioclase feldspar crystallized in large amounts from this magma ocean and floated toward the surface  the cumulate rocks form much of the crust  the upper part of the crust probably averages about 88  plagioclase  near the lower limit of 90  defined for anorthosite   the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the pyroxenes and olivine  but even that lower part probably averages about 78  plagioclase  9  the underlying mantle is denser and olivine-rich 
the thickness of the crust ranges between about 20 and 120km  crust on the far side of the moon averages about 12km thicker than that on the near side  estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about 50 to 60km  most of this plagioclase-rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon  between about 4.5 and 4.3 billion years ago  perhaps 10  or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase-rich material  the best-characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare basalts formed between about 3.9 and 3.2 billion years ago  minor volcanism continued after 3.2 billion years  perhaps as recently as 1 billion years ago  there is no evidence of plate tectonics 
study of the moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than earth  although the radius of the moon is only about a quarter that of earth  the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness  this thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the moon  magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about 3.9 billion years ago  but igneous rocks younger than 3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust  10
