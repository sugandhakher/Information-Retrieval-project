history edit 
stacks emitting smoke from burning discarded automobile batteries  photo taken in houston in 1972 by marc st  gil cs   official photographer of recently founded epa
same smokestacks in 1975 after the plant was closed in a push for greater environmental protection
beginning in the late 1950s 7  and through the 1960s  congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment  a key legislative option to address this concern was the declaration of a national environmental policy  8  advocates of this approach argued that without a specific policy  federal agencies were neither able nor inclined to consider the environmental impacts of their actions in fulfilling the agency s mission  citation needed  the statute that ultimately addressed this issue was the national environmental policy act of 1969  nepa  42 u s c   43214347   9  senator henry m  jackson proposed and helped write s 1075  the bill that eventually became the national environmental policy act  the law was signed by president nixon on january 1  1970  nepa was the first of several major environmental laws passed in the 1970s  it declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a council on environmental quality  ceq  in the executive office of the president  citation needed  to implement the national policy  nepa required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment  the  detailed statement  would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement  eis  
ruckelshaus sworn in as first epa administrator 
in 1970  president richard nixon proposed an executive reorganization that would consolidate many of the federal government s environmental responsibilities under one agency  a new environmental protection agency  that reorganization proposal was reviewed and passed by the house and senate  10 
staff recall that in the early days there was an enormous sense of purpose and excitement and the expectation that there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country  leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up americas environment   11 
for at least 10 years before nepa was enacted  12  bettersourceneeded  congress debated issues that the act would ultimately address  citation needed  the act was modeled on the resources and conservation act of 1959  introduced by senator james e  murray in the 86th congress  13  that bill would have established an environmental advisory counsel in the office of the president  declared a national environmental policy  and required the preparation of an annual environmental report  14  bettersourceneeded  in the years following the introduction of senator murray s bill  similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and congress s potential responses to perceived problems  in 1968  a joint house-senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the senate committee on interior and insular affairs  senator henry m  jackson  and the house committee on science and astronautics  representative george miller  to discuss the need for and potential means of implementing a national environmental policy  in the colloquium  some members of congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment  15 
when epa first began  the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad  and the agencys first administrator  william ruckelshaus  felt pressure to show a public that was deeply skeptical about governments effectiveness that epa could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution   16 
the epa began regulating greenhouse gases  ghgs  from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the clean air act  caa  for the first time on january 2  2011  standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to section 202 of the caa  and ghgs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of part c of title i of the act  see the page regulation of greenhouse gases under the clean air act for further information 
in may 2013  congress renamed the epa headquarters as the william jefferson clinton federal building  after former president bill clinton  17

this section is missing information about several major epa programs  please expand the section to include this information  further details may exist on the talk page   october 2010 
it is worth noting that  in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning  administrator william ruckelshaus observed that a danger for epa was that air  water  waste and other programs would be unconnected  placed in silos  a problem that persists more than 50 years later  albeit less so than at the start   33 
epa safer choice edit 
the epa safer choice label  previously known as the design for the environment  dfe  label  helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients  without sacrificing quality or performance  when a product has the safer choice label  it means that every intentionally - added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by epa scientists  only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the safer choice label 
safer detergents stewardship initiative edit 
through the safer detergents stewardship initiative  sdsi   34  epa s design for the environment  dfe  recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants  safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water  nonylphenol ethoxylates  commonly referred to as npes  are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant 
the design for the environment  which was renamed to epa safer choice in 2015  has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates  these safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available  cleangredients 35  is a source of safer surfactants 
energy star edit 
main article  energy star
in 1992 the epa launched the energy star program  a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency 
smartgrowth edit 
epa s smart growth program helps communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want  epa works with local  state  and national experts to discover and encourage development strategies that protect human health and the environment  create economic opportunities  and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels   36 
pesticides edit 
epa administers the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act  fifra   which is much older than the agency  and registers all pesticides legally sold in the united states 
fuel economy edit 
manufacturers selling automobiles in the united states are required to provide epa fuel economy test results for their vehicles and the manufacturers are not allowed to provide results from alternate sources  the fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicle s clean air act certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests 
the current testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in los angeles during that era  prior to 1984 the epa reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test  in 1984  the epa began adjusting city  aka urban dynamometer driving schedule or udds  results downward by 10  and highway  aka highway fuel economy test or hwfet  results by 22  to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972 and to better correlate the epa test results with real-world driving  in 1996  the epa proposed updating the federal testing procedures 37  to add a new higher speed test  us06  and an air-conditioner on test  sc03  to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports  the updated testing methodology was finalized in december  2006 for implementation with model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures  38 
in february 2005  the organization launched a program called  your mpg  39  that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the epa s fuel economy website and compare them with others and the original epa test results 
it is important to note that the epa actually conducts these tests on very few vehicles   while the public mistakenly presumes that this federal agency is hard at work conducting complicated tests on every new model of truck  van  car  and suv  in reality  just 18 of the epa s 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in ann arbor  michigan  examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year  or roughly 15 percent of new models  as to that other 85 percent  the epa takes automakers at their wordwithout any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate   40  two-thirds of the vehicles the epa tests themselves are selected randomly  and the remaining third are tested for specific reasons 
although originally created as a reference point for fossil fuelled vehicles  driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will do on a single charge  41 
air quality edit 
the air quality modeling group  aqmg  is in the epa s office of air and radiation  oar  and provides leadership and direction on the full range of air quality models  air pollution dispersion models 42  43  and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing pollution control strategies and the impacts of air pollution sources 
the aqmg serves as the focal point on air pollution modeling techniques for other epa headquarters staff  epa regional offices  and state and local environmental agencies  it coordinates with the epa s office of research and development  ord  on the development of new models and techniques  as well as wider issues of atmospheric research  finally  the aqmg conducts modeling analyses to support the policy and regulatory decisions of the epa s office of air quality planning and standards  oaqps  
the aqmg is located in research triangle park  north carolina 
addressing air quality issues helps diminish the risk of pollution-related diseases 
oil pollution edit 
the spill prevention  control  and countermeasure rule applies to all facilities that store  handle  process  gather  transfer  store  refine  distribute  use or consume oil or oil products  oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as  animal fats  oils and greases  fish and marine mammal oils  and vegetable oils   including oils from seeds  nuts  fruits  and kernels   mandates that a written plan is required for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground  and may reasonably be expected to discharge to navigable waters as defined in the clean water act or adjoining shorelines  secondary containment mandated at oil storage facilities  oil release containment is required at oil development sites 
toxics release inventory edit 
the toxics release inventory  tri  is a resource for learning about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities  tri data support informed decision-making by communities  government agencies  companies  and others   44 
epa watersense edit 
main article  watersense
watersense is an epa program designed to encourage water efficiency in the united states through the use of a special label on consumer products  it was launched in june 2006  45  products include high-efficiency toilets  hets   bathroom sink faucets  and accessories   and irrigation equipment  watersense is a voluntary program  with epa developing specifications for water-efficient products through a public process and product testing by independent laboratories  46 
drinking water edit 
main article  safe drinking water act
epa ensures safe drinking water for the public  by setting standards for more than 160,000 public water systems nationwide  epa oversees states  local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the safe drinking water act  the program includes regulation of injection wells in order to protect underground sources of drinking water  select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water  precipitation  and surface water  in addition to milk and air  are reported on epa s rad net web site in a section entitled envirofacts  in certain cases  readings exceeding epa mcl levels are deleted or not included 47  48  despite mandatory reporting regulations  a draft of revised epa regulations relaxes the regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water  stating that current standards are impractical to enforce  the epa is recommending that intervention is not necessary until drinking water is contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter  the limit for short term exposure set by the international atomic energy agency   which is 27,000 times the current epa limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure  49 
national pollutant discharge elimination system edit 
the national pollutant discharge elimination system  npdes  permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the united states  created in 1972 by the clean water act  the npdes permit program is authorized to state governments by epa to perform many permitting  administrative  and enforcement aspects of the program   50 
radiation protection edit 
epa has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation  51 
radioactive waste management 52 
emergency preparedness and response programs 53 
protective action guides and planning guidance for radiological incidents

tools for schools edit 
the rate of asthma in children is increasing at a pace that underscores the need for schools to address indoor air problems  epa s indoor air quality tools for schools program helps maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants  the program helps school personnel identify  solve  and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment  through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building  schools can also lower their students  and staff s risk of exposure to asthma triggers   60 
environmental education edit 
the national environmental education act of 1990 requires epa to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy  epa established the office of environmental education to implement this program  61 
environmental impact statement reviews edit 
epa is responsible for reviewing environmental impact statements of other federal agencies  projects  under the national environmental policy act  nepa  
clean school bus usa edit 
clean school bus usa is a national partnership to reduce children s exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling  installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones  its goal is to reduce both children s exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses   62 
research vessel edit 
main article  usns bold  t-agos-12 
osv bold docked at port canaveral  fl
on march 3  2004  the united states navy transferred usns bold  a stalwart class ocean surveillance ship  to the epa  now known as osv bold  the ship  previously used in anti-submarine operations during the cold war  is equipped with sidescan sonar  underwater video  water and sediment sampling instruments  used in study of ocean and coastline  one of the major missions of the bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials are dumped from dredging operations in u s  ports  63  in 2013  the bold was awarded to seattle central community college  sccc  by the general services administration  sccc demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose  and acquired the ship at a cost of  5,000  64 
advance identification edit 
advance identification  or adid  is a planning process used by the epa to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material  the epa conducts the process in cooperation with the u s  army corps of engineers and local states or native american tribes  as of february 1993  38 adid projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing  65 
freedom of information act processing performance edit 
in the latest center for effective government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most freedom of information act foia requests  published in 2015  using 2012 and 2013 data  the most recent years available   the epa earned a d by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points  i e  did not earn a satisfactory overall grade  66 
controversies edit 
epa headquarters in washington  d c 
there has been political controversy who   over whether environmental regulations generally increase or decrease national employment  67  68  69  70 
the  lt2  drinking water controversy edit 
in 2005  the epa issued the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule  lt2   71  the rule requires covering open-air reservoirs containing finished drinking water  in order to reduce the incidence of disease caused by microorganisms in drinking water 
to comply with the rule the epa ordered that a cap be placed over the hillview reservoir  the open reservoir where water bound for new york citys receives its final disinfection before entering the pipelines that serve the city  72  a number of city and state officials complained that the project was too costly and unnecessary  73  the hillview project is currently being reviewed by the epa 
in portland  oregon  there was opposition to capping its reservoirs from a local citizens group and city officials  but recently the city has decided to stop fighting and bring its reservoirs into compliance with lt2  74  75 
fiscal mismanagement edit 
epa director anne m  gorsuch resigned under fire in 1983 during a scandal over mismanagement of a  1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps  gorsuch based her administration of the epa on the new federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states  76  she believed that the epa was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective  during her 22 months as agency head  she cut the budget of the epa by 22   reduced the number of cases filed against polluters  relaxed clean air act regulations  and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides  she cut the total number of agency employees  and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating  77  environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters  and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency  78 
in 1982 congress charged that the epa had mishandled the  1.6 billion toxic waste superfund and demanded records from gorsuch  gorsuch refused and became the first agency director in u s  history to be cited for contempt of congress  the epa turned the documents over to congress several months later  after the white house abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoened by congress because they were covered by executive privilege  at that point  gorsuch resigned her post  citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation  79  critics charged that the epa was in a shambles at that time  80 
fuel economy edit 
in july 2005  an epa report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed  the report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it  but at the last minute the epa delayed its release  81 
the state of california sued the epa for its refusal to allow california and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars  82  epa administrator stephen l  johnson claimed that the epa was working on its own standards  but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level  which would then preempt state laws  83  84  85  california governor arnold schwarzenegger  along with governors from 13 other states  stated that the epa s actions ignored federal law  and that existing california standards  adopted by many states in addition to california  were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards  86  it was reported that stephen johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision  87 
after the federal government bailed out general motors and chrysler in the automotive industry crisis of 20082010  the 2010 chevrolet equinox was released with epa fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors  independent road tests 88  89  90  91  found that the vehicle did not out-perform its competitors  which had much lower fuel economy ratings  later road tests 92  93  found better  but inconclusive  results 
palm-based biodiesel and renewable diesel failed to meet the minimum 20  greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions savings threshold requirement to qualify as renewable fuels under the us renewable fuel standard 2  94  palm oil plantations threaten the habitats of the endangered orang-utan and dwarf elephant  95 
global warming edit 
wikinews has related news  epa proposes using clean air act to fight global warming
in december 2007  epa administrator stephen l  johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfarea decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations  associate deputy administrator jason burnett e-mailed the draft to the white house  white house aideswho had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate changeknew the gist of what johnson s finding would be  burnett said  they also knew that once they opened the attachment  it would become a public record  making it controversial and difficult to rescind  so they did not open it  rather  they called johnson and asked him to take back the draft  u s  law clearly stated that the final decision was the epa administrator s  not president bush s  johnson rescinded the draft  in july 2008  he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare  burnett resigned in protest  96

in 2004  the agency began a strategic planning exercise to develop plans for a more virtual approach to library services  the effort was curtailed in july 2005 when the agency proposed a  2.5 million cut in its 2007 budget for libraries  based on the proposed 2007 budget  the epa posted a notice to the federal register  september 20  2006 that epa headquarters library would close its doors to walk-in patrons and visitors on october 1  2006  97  the epa also closed some of its regional libraries and reduced hours in others  98  using the same fy 2007 proposed budget numbers 
on october 1  2008  the agency re-opened regional libraries in chicago  dallas and kansas city and the library at its headquarters in washington  dc  99 
in june 2011  the epa library network published a strategic plan 100  for fiscal years 20122014 
mercury emissions edit 
in march 2005  nine states  california  new york  new jersey  new hampshire  massachusetts  maine  connecticut  new mexico and vermont  sued the epa  the epa s inspector general had determined that the epa s regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the clean air act  and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees  101  102  the epa had suppressed a study it commissioned by harvard university which contradicted its position on mercury controls  103  the suit alleges that the epa s rule allowing exemption from  maximum available control technology  was illegal  and additionally charged that the epa s system of pollution credit trading allows power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions  104  several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations  illinois s proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90  by 2009  105 
9/11 air ratings edit 
main article  epa 9/11 pollution controversy
an august 2003 report released by epa s inspector general claimed that the white house put pressure on the epa to delete cautionary information about the air quality in new york city around ground zero following the september 11  2001 attacks 
an environmental protection agency employee checks one of the many air sampling locations set up around the world trade center site 
very fine airborne particulates edit 
tiny particles  under 2.5 micrometres  are attributed to health and mortality concerns  106  so some health advocates want the epa to regulate it  the science may be in its infancy  although many conferences have discussed the trails of this airborne matter in the air  foreign governments such as australia 107  and most member state of the european union have addressed this issue 
the epa first established standards in 1997  and strengthened them in 2006  as with other standards  regulation and enforcement of the pm2.5 standards is the responsibility of the state governments  through state implementation plans  108 
political pressure and scientific integrity edit 
in april 2008  the union of concerned scientists said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 epa staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work  the survey included chemists  toxicologists  engineers  geologists and experts in other fields of science  about 40  of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years  the highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life  109 
epa research has also been suppressed by career managers  110  supervisors at epa s national center for environmental assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about epa s integrated risk information system  which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication  and the corresponding author  ching-hung hsu  to leave epa  because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing   111  epa subjects employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint  even if those papers are written on personal time  112  a  3 million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by epa management during both the bush and obama administrations  and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps  113  epa employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry 114  115  116  and governmental pressure  and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports  114  117  118 
in 2015  the government accountability office stated that the epa violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms  the social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the waters of the united states rule  including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule  119 
environmental justice edit 
the epa has been criticized for its lack of progress towards environmental justice  administrator christine todd whitman was criticized for her changes to president bill clinton s executive order 12898 during 2001  removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation  and therefore defeating the spirit of the executive order  120  in a march 2004 report  the inspector general of the agency concluded that the epa  has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan  and has not established values  goals  expectations  and performance measurements  for environmental justice in its daily operations  another report in september 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs  policies and activities towards environmental justice  121  studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the epa s superfund program  and that this situation was worsening  120 
barriers to enforcing environmental justice edit 
localization edit 
many issues of environmental justice are localized  and are therefore hard to be addressed by federal agencies such as the epa  without significant media attention  political interest  or  crisis  status  local issues are less likely to be addressed at the local or federal level  with a still developing sector of environmental justice under the epa  small  local incidents are unlikely to be solved compared to larger  well publicized incidents 
conflicting political powers edit 
the white house maintains direct control over the epa  and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power  republicans and democrats differ in their approaches to  and perceived concerns of  environmental justice  while president bill clinton signed the executive order 12898  the bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices  which in turn affected the motivation for environmental enforcement  122 
responsibilities of the epa edit 
the epa is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes  informing the public of environmental enforcement  and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution  water pollution  hazardous wastes and chemicals  while the epa aids in preventing and identifying hazardous situations  it is hard to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities  123  it is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to  the epa answers to various groups  competes for resources  and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment  all of these present challenges  including a lack of resources  its self-policing policy  and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for epa officers  124 
authority of the epa edit 
under different circumstances  the epa faces many limitations to enforcing environmental justice  it does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities  125 
gold king mine waste water spill edit 
main article  2015 gold king mine waste water spill
on august 5  2015  while examining the level of pollutants in the gold king mine  126  epa workers released over three million gallons of toxic waste water  including heavy metals such as lead and arsenic into cement creek  which flowed into the animas river in colorado  127
