history edit 
military use edit 
the airfield was originally opened in 1933 as a civilian facility  but was requisitioned at the outbreak of world war ii and named raf trebelzue to support other bases in the cornwall area  the base was then renamed raf st mawgan 1943  after expansion  the facility was then handed to the usaaf where a number of improvements took place  including the building of a new control tower and expansion of the current runway  the airfield was then put under maintenance in 1947  and reopened as a coastal command base in 1951  since 1951  the base has seen various squadrons based  including 22 sqn   203 sqn  220 sqn   later renamed 201   228 sqn   later renamed 206   both long range reconnaissance squadrons  42 sqn   7 sqn   2625 sqn  royal auxiliary air force  and 1 sqn   raf regiment  - 2625 sqn was disbanded on 1 november 2006  whilst 1 sqn relocated to raf honington  the others relocated or closed  in 2005  raf st mawgan was one of the bases shortlisted to house the new joint combat aircraft  jca  in 2013  but in november 2005 it was announced by minister of state for the armed forces adam ingram that the operation would be based from scotland  helicopter maintenance  hmf  also ceased here in late 2006  citation needed 
flying operations at raf st mawgan  on the opposite side of the runway to the civil terminal  ceased in december 2008 
transition to fully civilian airport edit 
looking over the ramp at some of the airlines that serve nqy in summer 2007
in 2006 the airport introduced a 5 per passenger airport development fee  payable by all departing passengers via an atm type machine prior to passing security  4  this resulted in monarch airlines axing its route from the airport  to mlaga  and ryanair reducing the number of flights  though this was later restored  in 2015  it was announced that the 5 development fee would be scrapped in march 2016 
in 2008 the airport closed from the 1st until 19 december  this allowed extra time for the takeover of the airfield navigation services  i e  air traffic control fire services  from raf st mawgan and to fully meet caa standards  following further inspections by the caa  flights recommenced on 20 december 2008  citation needed 
by virtue of a recent statutory instrument issued on 22 september 2009  newquay airport will  from the coming in force of this instrument on 1 november 2009  be subject to current airport bylaws  as per section 63 of the airports act 1986 5 
the new terminal extension has increased the terminal size by 20   and was opened in 2006  this means the airport can handle as many as 450,000 passengers a year  in january 2008  cornwall county council approved plans for an expanded arrivals hall and departure lounge  a new retail outlet  a business lounge and new airfield structures caa  which were needed to gain the civil licence  in may 2008  the new arrivals and baggage reclaim area was opened  now allowing both domestic and international flights to simultaneously be processed unlike the old arrivals hall  this also added a gate to the departures lounge 
the expansion of the airport was criticised in 2007 by a number of environmental groups  this opposition was based not only on environmental concerns  given that the majority of flights are short-haul and to destinations that could be served by rail   but also socio-economic concerns that airport expansion would lead to a greater demand for second homes in cornwall  adding to already inflated local house prices  6 
in 2006 the irish low cost carrier ryanair pulled out of the airport ceasing flights to london stansted and girona-costa brava airport  7 
in november 2008  amidst the airport troubles  newquay airport released their draft master plan  outlining their plans for the airport until 2030  8 
civil airport operation edit 
in july 2011  the airport s main carrier  air southwest  announced the end of all flights from newquay with effect 30 september 2011  leaving the airport with only three year-round scheduled routes  citation needed 
in may 2013  flybe announced they would cease flying to london-gatwick  leaving newquay with year-round flights to just the isles of scilly and manchester  on 2 december 2013  flybe announced they had agreed a deal with newquay which will secure the future of the gatwick route until the end of october 2014  so that a public service obligation  pso  subsidy can be finalized  under the new deal flybe will operate 2 daily flights with the afternoon service being dropped  9 
aerohub enterprise zone edit 
in august 2011 the uk government announced that the airport s bid to host an enterprise zone for aerospace businesses had been successful  10  the aerohub enterprise zone was launched in april 2012  11  in september 2014  the uk s homes and communities agency and the european regional development fund agreed to fund the construction of a 6million aerohub business park  12  organisations attracted to aerohub by 2014 included classic air force and the bloodhound supersonic car project  11 
from 29 march 2013  classic air force has operated from the airport using a variety of different aircraft  13  including the world s oldest flying british jet aircraft and the only flying gloster meteor t7  14  since april 2013 classic air force has also operated a museum in the 70,000 square feet  6,500m2  hangar 404  which was previously used to service the hawker siddeley nimrods of raf st mawgan  13 
testing of bloodhound at speeds of over 200 miles per hour  320km h  is being performed on the runway in 2015 in preparation for the attempt on the land speed record in 2015/16 in south africa  15 
potential future uses edit 
in september 2013 the national aeronautical centre  nac  at aberporth airport announced it would use newquay as its second airport for testing unmanned aerial vehicles  uavs   16  the nac said it was attracted by the length of the runway and the facilities of aerohub  the test flights would require 3,000 square miles  7,800km2  of segregated airspace over the sea  17  in march 2015  the airport reported that the establishment of this segregated area had not yet been agreed with the department for transport  who stated that negotiations with international bodies to create an appropriate regulatory framework for uavs were still taking place  18 
in july 2014  newquay was one of 8 airports shortlisted by the civil aviation authority as a possible site for a uk commercial spaceport  19  the shortlist was reduced to 6 airports in march 2015  with newquay still a candidate  20
