this article is about the use and knowledge of techniques and processes for producing goods and services  for other uses  see technology  disambiguation  
a steam turbine with the case opened  most electricity is produced by thermal power stations with turbines like this one  electricity consumption and living standards are highly correlated  1  electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century 
technology   science of craft   from greek   techne   art  skill  cunning of hand   and -  -logia 2   is the collection of techniques  skills  methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives  such as scientific investigation  technology can be the knowledge of techniques  processes  and the like  or it can be embedded in machines  computers  devices  and factories  which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings of such things 
the human species  use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools  the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment  developments in historic times  including the printing press  the telephone  and the internet  have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale  the steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power  from clubs to nuclear weapons 
technology has many effects  it has helped develop more advanced economies  including today s global economy  and has allowed the rise of a leisure class  many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earth s environment  various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions  examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity  a term originally applied only to machines  and the challenge of traditional norms 
philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology  with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it  neo-luddism  anarcho-primitivism  and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world  arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people  proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition 
until recently  it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings  but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates 3  and certain dolphin communities 4  have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations

definition and usage
the spread of paper and printing to the west  as in this printing press  helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily  leading to the age of enlightenment  an example of technology as cultural force 
the use of the term  technology  has changed significantly over the last 200 years  before the 20th century  the term was uncommon in english  and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts  5  the term was often connected to technical education  as in the massachusetts institute of technology  chartered in 1861   6 
the term  technology  rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the second industrial revolution  the term s meanings changed in the early 20th century when american social scientists  beginning with thorstein veblen  translated ideas from the german concept of technik into  technology   in german and other european languages  a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english  which usually translates both terms as  technology   by the 1930s   technology  referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves  7 
in 1937  the american sociologist read bain wrote that  technology includes all tools  machines  utensils  weapons  instruments  housing  clothing  communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them   8  bain s definition remains common among scholars today  especially social scientists  but equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science  especially among scientists and engineers  although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition  9  more recently  scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of  technique  to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason  as in foucault s work on technologies of the self  techniques de soi  
dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions  the merriam-webster learner s dictionary offers a definition of the term   the use of science in industry  engineering  etc   to invent useful things or to solve problems  and  a machine  piece of equipment  method  etc   that is created by technology   10  ursula franklin  in her 1989  real world of technology  lecture  gave another definition of the concept  it is  practice  the way we do things around here   11  the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology  or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics  rather than technology as a whole  12  bernard stiegler  in technics and time  1  defines technology in two ways  as  the pursuit of life by means other than life   and as  organized inorganic matter   13 
technology can be most broadly defined as the entities  both material and immaterial  created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value  in this usage  technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems  it is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools  such as a crowbar or wooden spoon  or more complex machines  such as a space station or particle accelerator  tools and machines need not be material  virtual technology  such as computer software and business methods  fall under this definition of technology  14  w  brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as  a means to fulfill a human purpose   15 
the word  technology  can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques  in this context  it is the current state of humanity s knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products  to solve problems  fulfill needs  or satisfy wants  it includes technical methods  skills  processes  techniques  tools and raw materials  when combined with another term  such as  medical technology  or  space technology   it refers to the state of the respective field s knowledge and tools   state-of-the-art technology  refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field 
the invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor  here  an intel 4004 chip from 1971  led to the modern computer revolution 
technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture  16  additionally  technology is the application of math  science  and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known  a modern example is the rise of communication technology  which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures  the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer  17  not all technology enhances culture in a creative way  technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns  as a cultural activity  technology predates both science and engineering  each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor 
science  engineering and technology
antoine lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light
the distinction between science  engineering  and technology is not always clear  science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation  18  technologies are not usually exclusively products of science  because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility  usability  and safety 
engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means  often  but not always  using results and techniques from science  the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge  including scientific  engineering  mathematical  linguistic  and historical knowledge  to achieve some practical result 
technology is often a consequence of science and engineering  although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields  for example  science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge  this new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors  computers  and other forms of advanced technology  in this sense  scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists  the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference  19 
the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists  historians  and policymakers in the late 20th century  in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science  in the immediate wake of world war ii  for example  it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply  applied science  and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time  an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bush s treatise on postwar science policy  sciencethe endless frontier   new products  new industries  and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature    this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research   20  in the late-1960s  however  this view came under direct attack  leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks  initiatives resisted by the scientific community   the issue remains contentious  though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research  21  22

paleolithic  2.5 ma 10 ka 
a primitive chopper
further information  outline of prehistoric technology
the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution  early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal  23  with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans  24  tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history  approximately 50,000 years ago  the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged  believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language  25 
stone tools

hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago  the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock  but approximately 75,000 years ago  26  pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work 
fire
main article  control of fire by early humans
the discovery and utilization of fire  a simple energy source with many profound uses  was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind  27  the exact date of its discovery is not known  evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1 ma  28  scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between 500 and 400 ka  29  30  fire  fueled with wood and charcoal  allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility  improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten  31 
clothing and shelter
other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter  the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly  but they were a key to humanity s progress  as the paleolithic era progressed  dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate  as early as 380 ka  humans were constructing temporary wood huts  32  33  clothing  adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals  helped humanity expand into colder regions  humans began to migrate out of africa by 200 ka and into other continents such as eurasia  34 
neolithic through classical antiquity  10 ka 300 ce 
an array of neolithic artifacts  including bracelets  axe heads  chisels  and polishing tools
man s technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period   new stone age    the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms  agriculture fed larger populations  and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children  as infants no longer needed to be carried  as nomadic ones must  additionally  children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer economy  35  36 
with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization  37  what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities  such as uruk  and the first civilizations  such as sumer  is not specifically known  however  the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor  of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures  and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation  are all thought to have played a role  38 
metal tools
continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided the ability to smelt and forge native metals  naturally occurring in relatively pure form   39  gold  copper  silver  and lead  were such early metals  the advantages of copper tools over stone  bone  and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans  and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times  about 10 ka   40  native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts  but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires  eventually  the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass  about 4000 bce   the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1800 bce  41  42 
energy and transport
the wheel was invented circa 4000 bce 
main article  history of transport
meanwhile  humans were learning to harness other forms of energy  the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat  the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat that dates back to the 8th millenium bce  43  from prehistoric times  egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands  gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and  catch  basins  similarly  the early peoples of mesopotamia  the sumerians  learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes  however  more extensive use of wind and water  and even human  power required another invention 
according to archaeologists  the wheel was invented around 4000 bce probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia  in present-day iraq   the northern caucasus  maykop culture  and central europe  44  estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 bce with most experts putting it closer to 4000 bce  45  the oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about 3500 bce  46  however  the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made  there is also evidence from the same period for the use of the potter s wheel  more recently  the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia  47 
the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war  it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads  fast  rotary  potters  wheels enabled early mass production of pottery  but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy  through water wheels  windmills  and even treadmills  that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources 
medieval and modern history  300 ce present 
main articles  medieval technology  renaissance technology  industrial revolution  second industrial revolution  information technology  and productivity improving technologies  economic history 
innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk  the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire  medieval technology saw the use of simple machines  such as the lever  the screw  and the pulley  being combined to form more complicated tools  such as the wheelbarrow  windmills and clocks  the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations  including the printing press  which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge   and technology became increasingly associated with science  beginning a cycle of mutual advancement  the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food  followed by the wider availability of consumer goods 
the automobile revolutionized personal transportation 
starting in the united kingdom in the 18th century  the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery  particularly in the areas of agriculture  manufacturing  mining  metallurgy  and transport  driven by the discovery of steam power  technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor  light bulb  and countless others  scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine  chemistry  physics  and engineering  the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply  communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph  telephone  radio and television  the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile 
f-15 and f-16 flying over kuwaiti oil fires during the gulf war in 1991 
the 20th century brought a host of innovations  in physics  the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power  computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits  information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet  which ushered in the current information age  humans have also been able to explore space with satellites  later used for telecommunication  and in manned missions going all the way to the moon  in medicine  this era brought innovations such as open-heart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments 
complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies  and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools  modern technology increasingly relies on training and education their designers  builders  maintainers  and users often require sophisticated general and specific training  moreover  these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them  including engineering  medicine  and computer science  and other fields have been made more complex  such as construction  transportation and architecture 
philosophy
technicism
generally  technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies  48  taken to an extreme  technicism  reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality  to resolve all problems with the use of scientific-technological methods and tools   49  in other words  human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology  some  such as stephen v  monsma  50  connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority 
optimism
see also  extropianism
optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism  which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition  in these ideologies  technological development is morally good  some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and techno-utopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support  some have described karl marx as a techno-optimist  51 
skepticism and critics
see also  luddite  neo-luddism  anarcho-primitivism  and bioconservatism
luddites smashing a power loom in 1812
on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan  who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed  they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health 
many  such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger  hold serious  although not entirely  deterministic reservations about technology  see  the question concerning technology  52    according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa   heidegger does not oppose technology  he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that  in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or  what comes to the same thing  to rebel helplessly against it   indeed  he promises that  when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology  we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim   53   what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow  54 
some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics  for example aldous huxley s brave new world and other writings  anthony burgess s a clockwork orange  and george orwell s nineteen eighty-four  and  in faust by goethe  faust s selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world  is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology  more recently  modern works of science fiction  such as those by philip k  dick and william gibson  and films  e g  blade runner  ghost in the shell  project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology s impact on human society and identity 
the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and  finally  what he called  technopolies   that is  societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress  to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices  values and world-views  55 
darin barney has written about technology s impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture  suggesting that technology can be construed as  1  an object of political debate   2  a means or medium of discussion  and  3  a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship  as a setting for democratic culture  barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions  including the question of what a good life consists in  nearly impossible  because they already give an answer to the question  a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology  56 
nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology  such as genetic engineering  nanotechnology  synthetic biology and robotics  he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings  including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature  these concerns are shared by other philosophers  scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues  e g  francis fukuyama  jrgen habermas  william joy  and michael sandel   57 
another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus  who has published books on the internet and what computers still can t do 
another  more infamous anti-technological treatise is industrial society and its future  written by theodore kaczynski  aka the unabomber  and printed in several major newspapers  and later books  as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure 
appropriate technology
see also  technocriticism and technorealism
the notion of appropriate technology  however  was developed in the 20th century  e g   see the work of e  f  schumacher and of jacques ellul  to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere  the eco-village movement emerged in part due to this concern 
optimism and skepticism in the 21st century
this article mainly focusses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries 
the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face        what s the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem 
bernstein  jared   its not a skills gap thats holding wages down  its the weak economy  among other things   in the american prospect  october 2014
in his article  jared bernstein  a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities  58  questions the widespread idea that automation  and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem  his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism  basically  he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and eroding wages 
he uses two main arguments to defend his point  first of all  because of recent technological advances  an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs  yet  scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved  indeed  automationthreatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that  requires flexibility judgment and common sense  59  remain hard to be replaced by machines second  studies have not defined clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades 
therefore  according to jared bernstein  instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and eroding wages  one needs to worry more about  bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand  trade  income and opportunity   59 
complex technological systems
thomas p  hughes pointed out that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems  we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently  60  what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove  can we consider all of them  only a part of them or none of them as technologies 
technology is often considered too narrowly  according to thomas p  hughes  technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity  60  this definition emphasizing on creativity avoids unbounded definition that may mistakenly include cooking technologies  but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems 
yet  because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies  hughes argued that engineers  scientists  and managers often have believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want  they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned  60  for instance  evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts  internet-centrism and solutionism  61  internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces  solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet  in fact  technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations  according to alexis madrigal s critique of morozov s theory  to ignore it will lead to unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address  62  benjamin cohen and gwen ottinger precisely discussed the multivalent effects of technology  63 
therefore  recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed  especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues  gwen ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers new comprehension of their role  such an approach of technology and science   require  technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently   they have to consider themselves as  collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions   64 
competitiveness
technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function  the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology  and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage 
technology-based planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii  e g   dow  dupont  gm  and it what was used to transform the us into a superpower  it was not economic-based planning

in 1983 project socrates was initiated in the us intelligence community to determine the source of declining us economic and military competitiveness  project socrates concluded that technology exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage and that declining us competitiveness was from decision-making in the private and public sectors switching from technology exploitation  technology-based planning  to money exploitation  economic-based planning  at the end of world war ii 
project socrates determined that to rebuild us competitiveness  decision making throughout the us had to readopt technology-based planning  project socrates also determined that countries like china and india had continued executing technology-based  while the us took its detour into economic-based  planning  and as a result had considerably advanced the process and were using it to build themselves into superpowers  to rebuild us competitiveness the us decision-makers needed to adopt a form of technology-based planning that was far more advanced than that used by china and india 
project socrates determined that technology-based planning makes an evolutionary leap forward every few hundred years and the next evolutionary leap  the automated innovation revolution  was poised to occur  in the automated innovation revolution the process for determining how to acquire and utilize technology for a competitive advantage  which includes r d  is automated so that it can be executed with unprecedented speed  efficiency and agility 
project socrates developed the means for automated innovation so that the us could lead the automated innovation revolution in order to rebuild and maintain the country s economic competitiveness for many generations  65  66  67 
other animal species
see also  tool use by animals  structures built by animals  and ecosystem engineer
this adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the water s depth  an example of technology usage by non-human primates 
the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans  these include primates such as chimpanzees  some dolphin communities  68  69  and crows  70  71  considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control  we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams  or bees and their honeycombs 
the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo  72  however  the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans  for example  researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging  some of the tools used include leaf sponges  termite fishing probes  pestles and levers  73  west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts  74  as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista  brazil  75
