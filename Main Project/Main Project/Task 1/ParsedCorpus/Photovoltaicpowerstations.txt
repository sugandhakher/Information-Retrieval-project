the 25.7 mw lauingen energy park in bavarian swabia  germany
a photovoltaic power station  also known as a solar park  is a large-scale photovoltaic system  pv system  designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid  they are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level  rather than to a local user or users  they are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches  especially when sited in agricultural areas  the generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project 
the solar power source is via photovoltaic modules that convert light directly to electricity  however  this differs from  and should not be confused with concentrated solar power  the other large-scale solar generation technology  which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems  both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages  but to date  for a variety of reasons  photovoltaic technology has seen much wider use in the field  as of 2013 update   pv systems outnumber concentrators by about 40 to 1 
in some countries  the nameplate capacity of a photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak  mwp   which refers to the solar array s dc power output  however  canada  japan  spain and some parts of the united states often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in mwac  a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation  a third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes  mva   most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1mwp  as of 2015  the world s largest operating photovoltaic power stations have capacities of close to 600 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned  as at the end of 2015  about 3,400 projects with a combined capacity of 60gwac were solar farms larger than 4mw  1 
most of the existing large-scale photovoltaic power stations are owned and operated by independent power producers  but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing  to date  almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits  but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets  it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist

history edit 
the first 1 mwp solar park was built by arco solar at lugo near hesperia  california at the end of 1982  2  followed in 1984 by a 5.2 mwp installation in carrizo plain  3  both have since been decommissioned  though carrizo plain is the site for several large plants now being constructed 4  or planned  the next stage followed the 2004 revisions 5  to the feed-in tariffs in germany 6  when a substantial volume of solar parks were constructed  6 
serpa solar park built in portugal in 2006
several hundred installations over 1 mwp have been since been installed in germany  of which more than 50 are over 10 mwp  7  with its introduction of feed-in tariffs in 2008  spain became briefly the largest market  with some 60 solar parks over 10 mw  8  but these incentives have since been withdrawn  9  the usa  10  china 11  india  12  france  13  canada  14  and italy  15  amongst others  have also become major markets as shown on the list of photovoltaic power stations 
the largest sites under construction have capacities of hundreds of mwp and projects at a scale of 1 gwp are being planned  4  16  17 
siting and land use edit 
the land area required for a desired power output  varies depending on the location  18  and on the efficiency of the solar modules  19  the slope of the site 20  and the type of mounting used  fixed tilt solar arrays using typical modules of about 15  efficiency 21  on horizontal sites  need about 1 hectare mw in the tropics and this figure rises to over 2 hectares in northern europe  18 
because of the longer shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle  22  this area is typically about 10  higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis tracker  and 20  higher for a 2-axis tracker  23  though these figures will vary depending on the latitude and topography  24 
the best locations for solar parks in terms of land use are held to be brown field sites  or where there is no other valuable land use  25  even in cultivated areas  a significant proportion of the site of a solar farm can also be devoted to other productive uses  such as crop growing 26  27  or biodiversity  28 
agrivoltaics edit 
agrivoltaics is co-developing the same area of land for both solar photovoltaic power as well as for conventional agriculture  a recent study found that the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30  increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture   29 
co-location edit 
in some cases several different solar power stations  with separate owners and contractors  are developed on adjacent sites  30  this can offer the advantage of the projects sharing the cost and risks of project infrastructure such as grid connections and planning approval  31  solar farms can also be co-located with wind farms  32  sometimes the title  solar park  is used  rather than an individual solar power station  33  34 
some examples of such solar clusters are the charanka solar park  where there are 17 different generation projects  neuhardenberg  35  36  with eleven plants  and the golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500mw  37  38  an extreme example is calling all of the solar farms in the gujarat state of india a single solar park  the gujarat solar park 
technology edit 
most solar parks are ground mounted pv systems  also known as free-field solar power plants  39  they can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker  40  while tracking improves the overall performance  it also increases the system s installation and maintenance cost  41  42  a solar inverter converts the array s power output from dc to ac  and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage  three phase step up transformer of typically 10kv and above  43  44 
solar array arrangements edit 
the solar arrays are the subsystems which convert incoming light into electrical energy  45  they comprise a multitude of solar modules  mounted on support structures and interconnected to deliver a power output to electronic power conditioning subsystems  46 
a minority of utility-scale solar parks are configured on buildings 47  and so use building-mounted solar arrays  the majority are  free field  systems using ground-mounted structures  39  usually of one of the following types 
fixed arrays edit 
double glass photovoltaic solar modules  installed on a fixed support structure 
many projects use mounting structures where the solar modules are mounted at a fixed inclination calculated to provide the optimum annual output profile  40  the modules are normally oriented towards the equator  at a tilt angle slightly less than the latitude of the site  48  in some cases  depending on local climatic  topographical or electricity pricing regimes  different tilt angles can be used  or the arrays might be offset from the normal east-west axis to favour morning or evening output  49 
a variant on this design is the use of arrays  whose tilt angle can be adjusted twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output  40  they also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle  22  because the increased output is typically only a few percent  it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design  23 
dual axis trackers edit 
bellpuig solar park near lerida  spain uses pole-mounted 2-axis trackers
to maximise the intensity of incoming direct radiation  solar panels should be orientated normal to the sun s rays  50  to achieve this  arrays can be designed using two-axis trackers  capable of tracking the sun in its daily orbit across the sky  and as its elevation changes throughout the year  51 
these arrays need to be spaced out to reduce inter-shading as the sun moves and the array orientations change  so need more land area  52  they also require more complex mechanisms to maintain the array surface at the required angle  the increased output can be of the order of 30  53  in locations with high levels of direct radiation  but the increase is lower in temperate climates or those with more significant diffuse radiation  due to overcast conditions  for this reason  dual axis trackers are most commonly used in subtropical regions  52  and were first deployed at utility scale at the lugo plant  2 
single axis trackers edit 
a third approach achieves some of the output benefits of tracking  with a lesser penalty in terms of land area  capital and operating cost  this involves tracking the sun in one dimension  in its daily journey across the sky  but not adjusting for the seasons  54  the angle of the axis is normally horizontal  though some  such as the solar park at nellis airforce base  which have a 20 tilt  55  incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation  effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt  56 
single axis tracking systems are aligned along axes roughly north-south  57  some use linkages between rows so that the same actuator can adjust the angle of several rows at once  54 
power conversion edit 
solar panels produce direct current  dc  electricity  so solar parks need conversion equipment 46  to convert this to alternating current  ac   which is the form transmitted by the electricity grid  this conversion is done by inverters  to maximise their efficiency  solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers  either within the inverters or as separate units  these devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point  58 
there are two primary alternatives for configuring this conversion equipment  centralised and string inverters  59  although in some cases individual  or micro-inverters are used  60  single inverters allows optimizing the output of each panel  and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails  61 
centralised inverters edit 
waldpolenz solar park 62  is divided into blocks  each with a centralised inverter
these units have relatively high capacity  typically of the order of 1 mw  63  so they condition that the output of a substantial block of solar arrays  up to perhaps 2 hectares  4.9 acres  in area  64  solar parks using centralised inverters are often configured in discrete rectangular blocks  with the related inverter in one corner  or the centre of the block  65  66  67 
string inverters edit 
string inverters are substantially lower in capacity  of the order of 10kw  63  68  and condition the output of a single array string  this is normally a whole  or part of  a row of solar arrays within the overall plant  string inverters can enhance the efficiency of solar parks  where different parts of the array are experiencing different levels of insolation  for example where arranged at different orientations  or closely packed to minimise site area  61 
transformers edit 
the system inverters typically provide power output at voltages of the order of 480 vac  69  70  electricity grids operate at much higher voltages of the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of volts  71  so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid  44  due to the long lead time  the long island solar farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite  as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period  72  transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years  and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station  73 
system performance edit 
the performance of a solar park is a function of the climatic conditions  the equipment used and the system configuration  the primary energy input is the global light irradiance in the plane of the solar arrays  and this in turn is a combination of the direct and the diffuse radiation  74 
a key determinant of the output of the system is the conversion efficiency of the solar modules  which will depend in particular on the type of solar cell used  75 
there will be losses between the dc output of the solar modules and the ac power delivered to the grid  due to a wide range of factors such as light absorption losses  mismatch  cable voltage drop  conversion efficiencies  and other parasitic losses  76  a parameter called the  performance ratio  77  has been developed to evaluate the total value of these losses  the performance ratio gives a measure of the output ac power delivered as a proportion of the total dc power which the solar modules should be able to deliver under the ambient climatic conditions  in modern solar parks the performance ratio should typically be in excess of 80   78  79 
system degradation edit 
early photovoltaic systems output decreased as much as 10  year  3  but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5  year  with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate  so that a system would lose only 12  of its output performance in 25 years  a system using modules which degrade 4  year will lose 64  of its output during the same period  80  many panel makers offer a performance guarantee  typically 90  in ten years and 80  over 25 years  the output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3  during the first year of operation  81 
the business of developing solar parks edit 
westmill solar park 82  is the world s largest community-owned solar power station 83 
solar power plants are developed to deliver merchant electricity into the grid as an alternative to other renewable  fossil or nuclear generating stations  84 
the plant owner is an electricity generator  most solar power plants today are owned by independent power producers  ipp s   85  though some are held by investor- or community-owned utilities  86 
some of these power producers develop their own portfolio of power plants  87  but most solar parks are initially designed and constructed by specialist project developers  88  typically the developer will plan the project  obtain planning and connection consents  and arrange financing for the capital required  89  the actual construction work is normally contracted to one or more epc  engineering  procurement and construction  contractors  90 
major milestones in the development of a new photovoltaic power plant are planning consent  91  grid connection approval  92  financial close  93  construction  94  connection and commissioning  95  at each stage in the process  the developer will be able to update estimates of the anticipated performance and costs of the plant and the financial returns it should be able to deliver  96 
planning approval edit 
photovoltaic power stations occupy at least one hectare for each megawatt of rated output  97  so require a substantial land area  which is subject to planning approval  the chances of obtaining consent  and the related time  cost and conditions  varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and location to location  many planning approvals will also apply conditions on the treatment of the site after the station has been decommissioned in the future  70  a professional health  safety and environment assessment is usually undertaken during the design of a pv power station in order to ensure the facility is designed and planned in accordance with all hse regulations 
grid connection edit 
the availability  locality and capacity of the connection to the grid is a major consideration in planning a new solar park  and can be a significant contributor to the cost  98 
most stations are sited within a few kilometres of a suitable grid connection point  this network needs to be capable of absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity  the project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection  in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid  so it can accommodate the output from the plant  99 
operation and maintenance edit 
once the solar park has been commissioned  the owner usually enters into a contract with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance  o m   100  in many cases this may be fulfilled by the original epc contractor  101 
solar plants  reliable solid-state systems require minimal maintenance  compared to rotating machinery for example  102  a major aspect of the o m contract will be continuous monitoring of the performance of the plant and all of its primary subsystems  103  which is normally undertaken remotely  104  this enables performance to be compared with the anticipated output under the climatic conditions actually experienced  93  it also provides data to enable the scheduling of both rectification and preventive maintenance  105  a small number of large solar farms use a separate inverter 106  107  or maximizer 108  for each solar panel  which provide individual performance data that can be monitored  for other solar farms  thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non-performing panels for replacement  109 
power delivery edit 
a solar park s income derives from the sales of electricity to the grid  and so its output is metered in real-time with readings of its energy output provided  typically on a half-hourly basis  for balancing and settlement within the electricity market  110 
income is affected by the reliability of equipment within the plant and also by the availability of the grid network to which it is exporting  111  some connection contracts allow the transmission system operator to constrain the output of a solar park  for example at times of low demand or high availability of other generators  112  some countries make statutory provision for priority access to the grid 113  for renewable generators  such as that under the european renewable energy directive  114 
economics and finance edit 
in recent years  pv technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency  reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time  epbt   and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets by 2014  115  116  photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power  117  however  prices for pv systems show strong regional variations  much more than solar cells and panels  which tend to be global commodities  in 2013  utility-scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as china and germany were significantly lower   1.40 w  than in the united states   3.30 w   the iea explains these discrepancies due to differences in  soft costs   which include customer acquisition  permitting  inspection and interconnection  installation labor and financing costs  118  14

grid parity edit 
main article  grid parity
solar generating stations have become progressively cheaper in recent years  and this trend is expected to continue  119  meanwhile  traditional electricity generation is becoming progressively more expensive  120  these trends are expected to lead to a crossover point when the levelised cost of energy from solar parks  historically more expensive  matches the cost of traditional electricity generation  121  this point is commonly referred to as grid parity  122 
for merchant solar power stations  where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network  the levelised cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price  this point is sometimes called  wholesale grid parity  or  busbar parity   123 
some photovoltaic systems  such as rooftop installations  can supply power directly to an electricity user  in these cases  the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption  this situation is sometimes called  retail grid parity    socket parity  or  dynamic grid parity   124  research carried out by un-energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices  such as italy  spain and australia  and areas using diesel generators  have reached retail grid parity  123 
incentive mechanisms edit 
because the point of grid parity has not yet been reached in many parts of the world  solar generating stations need some form of financial incentive to compete for the supply of electricity  125  many legislatures around the world have introduced such incentives to support the deployment of solar power stations  126 
feed-in tariffs edit 
main article  feed-in tariff
feed in tariffs are designated prices which must be paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid  127  these tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project  128 
renewable portfolio standards and supplier obligations edit 
main article  renewable portfolio standard
these standards are obligations on utility companies to source a proportion of their electricity from renewable generators  129  in most cases  they do not prescribe which technology should be used and the utility is free to select the most appropriate renewable sources  130 
there are some exceptions where solar technologies are allocated a proportion of the rps in what is sometimes referred to as a  solar set aside   131 
loan guarantees and other capital incentives edit 
main article  loan guarantee
some countries and states adopt less targeted financial incentives  available for a wide range of infrastructure investment  such as the us department of energy loan guarantee scheme  132  which stimulated a number of investments in the solar power plant in 2010 and 2011  133 
tax credits and other fiscal incentives edit 
main article  tax credit
another form of indirect incentive which has been used to stimulate investment in solar power plant was tax credits available to investors  in some cases the credits were linked to the energy produced by the installations  such as the production tax credits  134  in other cases the credits were related to the capital investment such as the investment tax credits 135 
international  national and regional programmes edit 
in addition to free market commercial incentives  some countries and regions have specific programs to support the deployment of solar energy installations 
the european union s renewables directive 136  sets targets for increasing levels of deployment of renewable energy in all member states  each has been required to develop a national renewable energy action plan showing how these targets would be met  and many of these have specific support measures for solar energy deployment  137  the directive also allows states to develop projects outside their national boundaries  and this may lead to bilateral programs such as the helios project  138 
the clean development mechanism 139  of the unfccc is an international programme under which solar generating stations in certain qualifying countries can be supported  140 
additionally many other countries have specific solar energy development programmes  some examples are india s jnnsm  141  the flagship program in australia  142  and similar projects in south africa 143  and israel  144 
financial performance edit 
the financial performance of the solar power plant is a function of its income and its costs  23 
the electrical output of a solar park will be related to the solar radiation  the capacity of the plant and its performance ratio  77  the income derived from this electrical output will come primarily from the sale of the electricity  145  and any incentive payments such as those under feed-in tariffs or other support mechanisms  146 
electricity prices may vary at different times of day  giving a higher price at times of high demand  147  this may influence the design of the plant to increase its output at such times  148 
the dominant costs of solar power plants are the capital cost  and therefore any associated financing and depreciation  149  though operating costs are typically relatively low  especially as no fuel is required  102  most operators will want to ensure that adequate operation and maintenance cover 103  is available to maximise the availability of the plant and thereby optimise the income to cost ratio  150 
geography edit 
main articles  solar power by country and growth of photovoltaics
the first places to reach grid parity were those with high traditional electricity prices and high levels of solar radiation  18  currently  more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility-scale segment  however  the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity  151  this transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants  since the focus of new pv deployment has changed from europe towards the sunbelt markets where ground-mounted pv systems are favored  152  43
because of the economic background  large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes have been the most consistent  or the most advantageous  153  total capacity of worldwide pv plants above 4 mwac was assessed by wiki-solar as 36 gw in c  2,300 installations at the end of 2014 154  and represents about 25 percent of total global pv capacity of 139gw  152  17 the countries which had the most capacity  in descending order  were the united states  china  germany  india  united kingdom  spain  italy  canada and south africa  155  activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below 
china edit 
main article  solar power in china
china was reported in early 2013 to have overtaken germany as the nation with the most utility-scale solar capacity  156  much of this has been supported by the clean development mechanism  157  the distribution of power plants around the country is quite broad  with the highest concentration in the gobi desert 11  and connected to the northwest china power grid  158 
germany edit 
main article  solar power in germany
the first multi-megawatt plant in europe was the 4.2 mw community-owned project at hemau  commissioned in 2003  159  but it was the revisions to the german feed-in tariffs in 2004  5  which gave the strongest impetus to the establishment of utility-scale solar power plants  160  the first to be completed under this programme was the leipziger land solar park developed by geosol  161  several dozen plants were built between 2004 and 2011  several of which were at the time the largest in the world  the eeg  the law which establishes germanys feed-in tariffs  provides the legislative basis not just for the compensation levels  but other regulatory factors  such as priority access to the grid  113  the law was amended in 2010 to restrict the use of agricultural land  162  since which time most solar parks have been built on so-called development land  such as former military sites  35  partly for this reason  the geographic distribution of photovoltaic power plants in germany 7  is biased towards the former eastern germany  163  164  as of february 2012  germany had 1.1 million photovoltaic power plants  most are small kw roof mounted   165 
india edit 
main article  solar power in india
india has been rising up the leading nations for the installation of utility-scale solar capacity  156  the charanka solar park in gujarat was opened officially in april 2012 166  and was at the time the largest group of solar power plants in the world  geographically the majority of the stations are located in gujarat and maharashtra  12  rajasthan has successfully been attempting to attract solar development  167  it and gujarat share the thar desert  along with pakistan 
italy edit 
main article  solar power in italy
italy has a very large number of photovoltaic power plants  the largest of which is the 84 mw montalto di castro project  168 
spain edit 
main article  solar power in spain
the majority of the deployment of solar power stations in spain to date occurred during the boom market of 2007-8  169  the stations are well distributed around the country  with some concentration in extremadura  castile-la mancha and murcia  8 
united kingdom edit 
main article  solar power in the united kingdom
the introduction of feed-in tariffs in the united kingdom in 2010 stimulated the first wave of utility-scale projects  170  with c  20 plants being completed 171  before tariffs were reduced on 1 august 2011 following the  fast track review   172  a second wave of installations was undertaken under the uk s renewables obligation  with the total number of plants connected by the end of march 2013 reaching 86  173  this is reported to have made the uk europe s best market in the first quarter of 2013  174 
uk projects were originally concentrated in the south west  but have more recently spread across the south of england and into east anglia and the midlands  175  the first solar park in wales came on stream in 2011 at rhosygilwen  north pembrokeshire  176  as of june 2014 there were 18 schemes generating more than 5mw and 34 in planning or construction in wales  177 
united states edit 
main article  solar power in the united states
the us deployment of photovoltaic power stations is largely concentrated in southwestern states  10  the renewable portfolio standards in california 178  and surrounding states 179  180  provide a particular incentive  the volume of projects under construction in early 2013 has led to the forecast that the us will become the leading market  156
