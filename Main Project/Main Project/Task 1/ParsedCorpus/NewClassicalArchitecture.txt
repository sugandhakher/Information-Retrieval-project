schermerhorn symphony center in nashville - opened in 2006
new classical architecture is a contemporary movement in architecture that continues the practice of classical and traditional architecture  the design and construction of buildings in these traditions is continuous throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries  even as modernist and other post-classical theories of architecture have been more dominant  since new classical architecture is not an architectural style and can appear in various forms  contemporary classical buildings might be also  although not correctly  be described with the terms traditionalism  neo-historism  or historicism revivalism   or simply neoclassical architecture  implying the continuation of a specific historical style  1

development edit 
richmond riverside in london by quinlan terry  198487  
at the beginning of the 20th century  historicism and jugendstil were still dominant styles in germany  the austrian architect adolf loos criticized his time s architecture as too  grandiloquent  and  opulent   and longed for a complete abandonment of architectural ornaments in his 1910 essay ornament and crime  2  as early as the first major modernist movements like werkbund and bauhaus gained momentum in germany  the desire to continue and develop classical styles sprouted  3  from 1904 until around 1955 the heimatschutz style prospered in germany  which focused on vernacular traditions and can be roughly translated to cultural protection style  examples of this early new classical style are the hamburg museum  the prinzipalmarkt in mnster and the market square of freudenstadt  after heavy allied bombing of germany in world war ii  architects such as adolf abel  roderich fick  konstanty gutschow  werner march  paul schmitthenner  julius schulte-frohlinde  and rudolf wolters assisted in the postwar rebuilding of destroyed german cities using heimatschutz and other traditional design methods  in britain  architect raymond erith continued to design classical houses into the late 1960s and early 1970s  quinlan terry  a new classical architect who continues to practice  was an employee  later a partner and now the successor of the late raymond erith  in the late 1970s several young architects in europe began challenging modernist proposals in architecture and planning  to broadcast them  leon krier and maurice culot founded the archives d architecture moderne in brussels and began publishing texts and counterprojects to modernist proposals in architecture and planning  4  it received a boost from the sponsorship of charles  prince of wales  especially with the prince s foundation for building community  5

with the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture  several phd programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history phd programs  where architectural historians had previously trained  in the us  mit and cornell were the first  created in the mid-1970s  followed by columbia  berkeley  and princeton  among the founders of new architectural history programs were bruno zevi at the institute for the history of architecture in venice  stanford anderson and henry millon at mit  alexander tzonis at the architectural association  anthony vidler at princeton  manfredo tafuri at the university of venice  kenneth frampton at columbia university  and werner oechslin and kurt forster at eth zrich  7  the creation of these programs was paralleled by the hiring  in the 1970s  of professionally trained historians by schools of architecture  margaret crawford  with a phd from u c l a  at sci-arc  elisabeth grossman  phd  brown university  at rhode island school of design  christian otto 8   phd  columbia university  at cornell university  richard chafee  phd  courtauld institute  at roger williams university  and howard burns  m a  kings college  at harvard 
in these years postmodern architecture developed a critique of modernist architectural aesthetics  9  among them were certain influential postmodernist architects such as charles moore  robert venturi  10  and michael graves  who used classical elements as ironic motifs in order to criticize modernism s sterility  a broad spectrum of more than two dozen architects  theorists  and historians presented other alternatives to modernism  11  among them were several serious new classical architects who saw classicism as a legitimate mode of architectural expression  several of whom would later become driehaus prize laureates  including some such as thomas beeby and robert a m  stern  who practice both in post modern as well as classical modes  some postmodernist firms  such as stern and albert  righter    tittman  fully moved from postmodern design to new interpretations of traditional architecture  9  thomas gordon smith  the 1979 rome prize laureate from the american academy in rome  was a devotee of charles moore  in 1988 smith published  classical architecture - rule and invention  and in 1989 was appointed to be chair of the university of notre dame department of architecture  which is now the school of architecture  12  today other programs exist which teach in part new classical architecture at the university of miami  judson university  andrews university and beginning in 2013  13  the center for advanced research in traditional architecture at the university of colorado denver 
alongside these academic and scholarly developments  a populist and professional manifestation of new classicism has existed and continues to develop  the 1963 demolition of mckim  meade and white s pennsylvania railroad station in new york city provoked the formation of classical america and its regional chapters  led by henry hope reed  jr   14  classical america advocated the appreciation of classically inspired buildings and for the practice of contemporary classical and traditional design by teaching architects to draw the classical orders  hosting walking tours  educational events  conferences and publishing the classical america series in art and architecture  15  in 2002  the then-named institute of classical architecture merged with classical america to form the institute of classical architecture   classical america  now the institute of classical architecture   art   the icaa currently supports and is supported by regional chapters across the united states  almost all of which host awards programs  16  which recognize significant accomplishments in new classical and traditional design and construction  the icaa publishes the classicist  17  a peer-reviewed journal exclusively dedicated to the theory and practice of contemporary classicism in architecture  urbanism  and the allied arts  the icaa offers educational programs to architecture and design professionals  many of which follow the methodologies of the cole des beaux-arts  the icaa also teaches courses to educate the general public  18  and has created programs such as the beaux arts atelier  the advanced program in residential design for the american institute of building designers  and many other unique programs 
in 2003  chicago philanthropist richard h  driehaus established 19  a prize in architecture to be given to an architect  whose work embodies the principles of classical and traditional architecture and urbanism in society  and creates a positive  long lasting impact   awarded by the university of notre dame school of architecture  the driehaus architecture prize is seen as the alternative to the modernist pritzker prize  the driehaus prize is given in conjunction with the reed award  for an individual working outside the practice of architecture who has supported the cultivation of the traditional city  its architecture and art through writing  planning or promotion  20  other high-profiled classical architecture awards are the us-american palladio award  21  the edmund n  bacon prize  22  and the rieger graham prize 23  of the institute of classical architecture and art  icaa  for architecture graduates 
philosophy edit 
see also  sustainable architecture
fundamental tenets of the new classicism is that it is not limited to neoclassical architecture and that  classical  is not a style in itself  but a way of elevating the art of building to the art of architecture  24  a classical building uses imitation to express its tectonic truth  which is not the same as the facts of its construction  and finds its beauty not in originality and style but in the handling of the traditional forms that have always been its vehicles  classical buildings also always account for the differences between the public and the private realms in addressing the urban and rural conditions where they are built  new classical architects also emphasize the awareness of sustainability  the aim is to create long-lasting  well-crafted buildings of great quality  with an efficient use of natural resources  25 
education edit
