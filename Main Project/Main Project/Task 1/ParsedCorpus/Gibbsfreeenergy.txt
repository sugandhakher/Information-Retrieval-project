in thermodynamics  the gibbs free energy  iupac recommended name  gibbs energy or gibbs function  also known as free enthalpy 1  to distinguish it from helmholtz free energy  is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum or reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure  isothermal  isobaric   just as in mechanics  where the decrease in potential energy is defined as maximum useful work that can be performed  similarly different potentials have different meanings  the decrease in gibbs free energy  kj in si units  is the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system  one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings  but not matter   this maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process  when a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state  the decrease in gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings  minus the work of the pressure forces  2 
the gibbs energy  also referred to as g  is also the thermodynamic potential that is minimized when a system reaches chemical equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature  its derivative with respect to the reaction coordinate of the system vanishes at the equilibrium point  as such  a reduction in g is a necessary condition for the spontaneity of processes at constant pressure and temperature 
the gibbs free energy  originally called available energy  was developed in the 1870s by the american scientist josiah willard gibbs  in 1873  gibbs described this  available energy  as
the greatest amount of mechanical work which can be obtained from a given quantity of a certain substance in a given initial state  without increasing its total volume or allowing heat to pass to or from external bodies  except such as at the close of the processes are left in their initial condition  3 
the initial state of the body  according to gibbs  is supposed to be such that  the body can be made to pass from it to states of dissipated energy by reversible processes   in his 1876 magnum opus on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances  a graphical analysis of multi-phase chemical systems  he engaged his thoughts on chemical free energy in full

overview edit 
the reaction c s diamondc s graphite has a negative change in gibbs free energy and is therefore thermodynamically favorable at 25c and 1 atm  however  even though favorable  it is so slow that it is not observed  whether a reaction is thermodynamically favorable does not determine its rate 
according to the second law of thermodynamics  for systems reacting at stp  or any other fixed temperature and pressure   there is a general natural tendency to achieve a minimum of the gibbs free energy 
a quantitative measure of the favorability of a given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the change g in gibbs free energy that is  or would be  caused by the reaction  as a necessary condition for the reaction to occur at constant temperature and pressure  g must be smaller than the non-pv clarification needed   e g  electrical  work  which is often equal to zero  g equals the maximum amount of non-pv work that can be performed as a result of the chemical reaction for the case of reversible process  if the analysis indicated a positive g for the reaction  then energy in the form of electrical or other non-pv work would have to be added to the reacting system for g to be smaller than the non-pv work and make it possible for the reaction to occur  4  298299
the equation can be also seen from the perspective of the system taken together with its surroundings  the rest of the universe   first assume that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring  then the entropy released or absorbed by the system equals the entropy that the environment must absorb or release  respectively  the reaction will only be allowed if the total entropy change of the universe is zero or positive  this is reflected in a negative g  and the reaction is called exergonic 
if we couple reactions  then an otherwise endergonic chemical reaction  one with positive g  can be made to happen  the input of heat into an inherently endergonic reaction  such as the elimination of cyclohexanol to cyclohexene  can be seen as coupling an unfavourable reaction  elimination  to a favourable one  burning of coal or other provision of heat  such that the total entropy change of the universe is greater than or equal to zero  making the total gibbs free energy difference of the coupled reactions negative 
in traditional use  the term  free  was included in  gibbs free energy  to mean  available in the form of useful work   2  the characterization becomes more precise if we add the qualification that it is the energy available for non-volume work clarification needed   5   an analogous  but slightly different  meaning of  free  applies in conjunction with the helmholtz free energy  for systems at constant temperature   however  an increasing number of books and journal articles do not include the attachment  free   referring to g as simply  gibbs energy   this is the result of a 1988 iupac meeting to set unified terminologies for the international scientific community  in which the adjective free was supposedly banished  6  7  8  this standard  however  has not yet been universally adopted 
history edit 
see also  thermodynamic free energy
the quantity called  free energy  is a more advanced and accurate replacement for the outdated term affinity  which was used by chemists in the earlier years of physical chemistry to describe the force that caused chemical reactions 
in 1873  willard gibbs published a method of geometrical representation of the thermodynamic properties of substances by means of surfaces  in which he sketched the principles of his new equation that was able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact  by studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact  i e   bodies composed of part solid  part liquid  and part vapor  and by using a three-dimensional volume-entropy-internal energy graph  gibbs was able to determine three states of equilibrium  i e    necessarily stable    neutral   and  unstable   and whether or not changes would ensue  further  gibbs stated  9 
if we wish to express in a single equation the necessary and sufficient condition of thermodynamic equilibrium for a substance when surrounded by a medium of constant pressure p and temperature t  this equation may be written 
   t   p    0
when  refers to the variation produced by any variations in the state of the parts of the body  and  when different parts of the body are in different states  in the proportion in which the body is divided between the different states  the condition of stable equilibrium is that the value of the expression in the parenthesis shall be a minimum 
in this description  as used by gibbs   refers to the internal energy of the body   refers to the entropy of the body  and  is the volume of the body 
thereafter  in 1882  the german scientist hermann von helmholtz characterized the affinity as the largest quantity of work which can be gained when the reaction is carried out in a reversible manner  e g   electrical work in a reversible cell  the maximum work is thus regarded as the diminution of the free  or available  energy of the system  gibbs free energy g at t   constant  p   constant or helmholtz free energy f at t   constant  v   constant   whilst the heat given out is usually a measure of the diminution of the total energy of the system  internal energy   thus  g or f is the amount of energy  free  for work under the given conditions 
until this point  the general view had been such that   all chemical reactions drive the system to a state of equilibrium in which the affinities of the reactions vanish   over the next 60 years  the term affinity came to be replaced with the term free energy  according to chemistry historian henry leicester  the influential 1923 textbook thermodynamics and the free energy of chemical substances by gilbert n  lewis and merle randall led to the replacement of the term  affinity  by the term  free energy  in much of the english-speaking world  10  206
graphical interpretation edit 
gibbs free energy was originally defined graphically  in 1873  american scientist willard gibbs published his first thermodynamics paper   graphical methods in the thermodynamics of fluids   in which gibbs used the two coordinates of the entropy and volume to represent the state of the body  in his second follow-up paper   a method of geometrical representation of the thermodynamic properties of substances by means of surfaces   published later that year  gibbs added in the third coordinate of the energy of the body  defined on three figures  in 1874  scottish physicist james clerk maxwell used gibbs  figures to make a 3d energy-entropy-volume thermodynamic surface of a fictitious water-like substance  11  thus  in order to understand the very difficult concept of gibbs free energy one must be able to understand its interpretation as gibbs defined originally by section ab on his figure 3 and as maxwell sculpted that section on his 3d surface figure 
american scientist willard gibbs  1873 figures two and three  above left and middle  used by scottish physicist james clerk maxwell in 1874 to create a three-dimensional entropy  x   volume  y   energy  z  thermodynamic surface diagram for a fictitious water-like substance  transposed the two figures of gibbs  above right  onto the volume-entropy coordinates  transposed to bottom of cube  and energy-entropy coordinates  flipped upside down and transposed to back of cube   respectively  of a three-dimensional cartesian coordinates  the region ab being the first-ever three-dimensional representation of gibbs free energy  or what gibbs called  available energy   the region ac being its capacity for entropy  what gibbs defined as  the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume 
definitions edit 
willard gibbs 1873 available energy  free energy  graph  which shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of v  volume  and passing through point a  which represents the initial state of the body  mn is the section of the surface of dissipated energy  q and q are sections of the planes    0 and    0  and therefore parallel to the axes of   internal energy  and   entropy   respectively  ad and ae are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state  ab and ac its available energy  gibbs free energy  and its capacity for entropy  the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume  respectively

where 
i is the chemical potential of the ith chemical component   si unit  joules per particle 12  or joules per mole 2  
ni is the number of particles  or number of moles  composing the ith chemical component 
this is one form of gibbs fundamental equation  13  in the infinitesimal expression  the term involving the chemical potential accounts for changes in gibbs free energy resulting from an influx or outflux of particles  in other words  it holds for an open system  for a closed system  this term may be dropped 
any number of extra terms may be added  depending on the particular system being considered  aside from mechanical work  a system may  in addition  perform numerous other types of work  for example  in the infinitesimal expression  the contractile work energy associated with a thermodynamic system that is a contractile fiber that shortens by an amount dl under a force f would result in a term f dl being added  if a quantity of charge de is acquired by a system at an electrical potential   the electrical work associated with this is de  which would be included in the infinitesimal expression  other work terms are added on per system requirements  14 
each quantity in the equations above can be divided by the amount of substance  measured in moles  to form molar gibbs free energy  the gibbs free energy is one of the most important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system  it is a factor in determining outcomes such as the voltage of an electrochemical cell  and the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction  in isothermal  isobaric systems  gibbs free energy can be thought of as a  dynamic  quantity  in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic clarification needed  and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process

but notice that to obtain equation  1  from equation  2  we must assume that t is constant  thus  gibbs free energy is most useful for thermochemical processes at constant temperature and pressure  both isothermal and isobaric  such processes don t move on a p-t diagram  such as phase change of a pure substance  which takes place at the saturation pressure and temperature  chemical reactions  however  do undergo changes in chemical potential  which is a state function  thus  thermodynamic processes are not confined to the two dimensional p-v diagram  there is an additional dimension for the extent of the chemical reaction  associated with the changes of the amounts of the substances in the system  for the study of explosive chemicals  the processes are not necessarily isothermal and isobaric  for these studies  helmholtz free energy is used

gibbs free energy  the second law of thermodynamics  and metabolism edit 
a chemical reaction will  or can  proceed spontaneously if the change in the total entropy of the universe that would be caused by the reaction is nonnegative  as discussed in the overview  if the temperature and pressure are held constant  the gibbs free energy is a  negative  proxy for the change in total entropy of the universe  it is  negative  because s appears with a negative coefficient in the expression for g  so the gibbs free energy moves in the opposite direction from the total entropy  thus  a reaction with a positive gibbs free energy will not proceed spontaneously  however  in biological systems  among others   energy inputs from other energy sources  including the sun and exothermic chemical reactions  are  coupled  with reactions that are not entropically favored  i e  have a gibbs free energy above zero   taking into account the coupled reactions  the total entropy in the universe increases  this coupling allows endergonic reactions  such as photosynthesis and dna synthesis  to proceed without decreasing the total entropy of the universe  thus biological systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics 
standard energy change of formation edit 
the standard gibbs free energy of formation of a compound is the change of gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole of that substance from its component elements  at their standard states  the most stable form of the element at 25 degrees celsius and 100 kilopascals   its symbol is fg 
all elements in their standard states  diatomic oxygen gas  graphite  etc   have standard gibbs free energy change of formation equal to zero  as there is no change involved 
fg   fg   rt ln qf  qf is the reaction quotient 
at equilibrium  fg   0 and qf   k so the equation becomes fg   rt ln k  k is the equilibrium constant
