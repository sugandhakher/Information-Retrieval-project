coal-burning factories in 19th-century manchester  england  improved technology allowed coal to fuel the industrial revolution  greatly increasing the consumption of coal 
in economics  the jevons paradox   dvnz   sometimes jevons effect  occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used  reducing the amount necessary for any one use   but the rate of consumption of that resource rises because of increasing demand  1  the jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics  2  however  governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption  ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising  3 
in 1865  the english economist william stanley jevons observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries  he argued that  contrary to common intuition  technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption  4  5 
the issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption rebound effects from improved energy efficiency  in addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use  improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource  which increases the quantity demanded  this counteracts  to some extent  the reduction in use from improved efficiency  additionally  improved efficiency accelerates economic growth  further increasing the demand for resources  the jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates  and better efficiency leads to more resources being used  5 
considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of jevons paradox to energy conservation  some dismiss the paradox  while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency  3  environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same  or higher  to avoid the jevons paradox  6  conservation policies  such as cap and trade  do not display the paradox  and can be used to control the rebound effect  7

history edit 
william stanley jevons  after whom the paradox is named
the jevons paradox was first described by the english economist william stanley jevons in his 1865 book the coal question  jevons observed that england s consumption of coal soared after james watt introduced the watt steam engine  which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired steam engine from thomas newcomen s earlier design  watt s innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source  leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries  this in turn increased total coal consumption  even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell  jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase  rather than decrease  fuel use  writing   it is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption  the very contrary is the truth   4 
at that time  many in britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling  but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption  jevons argued that this view was incorrect  as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal  hence  improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which england s coal deposits were being depleted  and could not be relied upon to solve the problem  4  5 
although jevons originally focused on the issue of coal  the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource  including  for example  water usage  8  it is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics  2 
cause edit 
elastic demand  a 20  increase in efficiency causes a 40  increase in travel  fuel consumption increases and the jevons paradox occurs 
inelastic demand  a 20  increase in efficiency causes a 10  increase in travel  the jevons paradox does not occur 
main article  rebound effect  conservation 
economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient  causing a  rebound  in the demand for fuel  9  an increase in the efficiency with which a resource  e g  fuel  is used  causes a decrease in the cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve  e g  travel   generally speaking  a decrease in the cost  or price  of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded  the law of demand   with a lower cost for travel  consumers will travel more  increasing the demand for fuel  this increase in demand is known as the rebound effect  and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency  the jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100   exceeding the original efficiency gains  5 
the size of the rebound effect is determined by the price elasticity of demand for the good  in a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used  if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled  the effective price of travel would be halved  twice as much travel can be purchased   if in response  the amount of travel purchased more than doubles  i e  demand is price elastic   then fuel consumption would increase  and the jevons paradox would occur  if demand is price inelastic  the amount of travel purchased would less than double  and fuel consumption would decrease  however  goods and services generally use more than one type of input  e g  fuel  labour  machinery   and other factors besides input cost may also affect price  these factors tend to reduce the rebound effect  making the jevons paradox less likely to occur  5 
khazzoombrookes postulate edit 
main article  khazzoombrookes postulate
in the 1980s  economists daniel khazzoom and leonard brookes revisited the jevons paradox for the case of society s energy use  brookes  then chief economist at the uk atomic energy authority  argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole  khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the california energy commission  10  11 
in 1992  the economist harry saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in energy efficiency work to increase  rather than decrease  energy consumption the khazzoombrookes postulate  and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory  the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation  technological progress and long-run economic growth   saunders showed that the khazzoombrookes postulate occurs in the neoclassical growth model under a wide range of assumptions  10  12 
according to saunders  increased energy efficiency tends to increase energy consumption by two means  first  increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper  thus encouraging increased use  the direct rebound effect   second  increased energy efficiency leads to increased economic growth  which pulls up energy use for the whole economy  at the microeconomic level  looking at an individual market   even with the rebound effect  improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption  13  that is  the rebound effect is usually less than 100   however  at the macroeconomic level  more efficient  and hence comparatively cheaper  energy leads to faster economic growth  which increases energy use throughout the economy  saunders argued that  taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects  technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use  10

jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use  but this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless  higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life  14  for example  a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the industrial revolution  however  if the khazzoombrookes postulate is correct  increased fuel efficiency  by itself  will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels  10 
there is considerable debate about whether the khazzoom-brookes postulate is correct  and of the relevance of jevons paradox to energy conservation policy  most governments  environmentalists and ngos pursue policies that improve efficiency  holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems  others  including many environmental economists  doubt this  efficiency strategy  towards sustainability  and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption  they hold that for resource use to fall  efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use  3  12  15 
the jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that energy conservation efforts are futile  for example  that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand  and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil  this argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency  e g  if cars are more efficient  it will simply lead to more driving   16  17  several points have been raised against this argument  first  in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries  the direct rebound effect is usually small  and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use  other conditions remaining constant  9  13  18  second  even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used  there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency  for example  increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases  shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil  19  third  environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention  e g  a fuel tax  that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher  6 
the jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use  and that sustainable energy policy must rely on other types of government interventions  7  20  as the jevons paradox applies only to technological improvements that increase fuel efficiency  the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase costs do not display the paradox and can be used to control the rebound effect  7  to ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use  efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand  e g  green taxes  cap and trade  or higher emissions standards   the ecological economists mathis wackernagel and william rees have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be  taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation  preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in natural capital rehabilitation   6  by mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities  efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable  and more likely to be implemented  21
