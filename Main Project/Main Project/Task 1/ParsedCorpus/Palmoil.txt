palm oil  also known as dend oil  from portuguese  is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp  reddish pulp  of the fruit of the oil palms  primarily the african oil palm elaeis guineensis  1  and to a lesser extent from the american oil palm elaeis oleifera and the maripa palm attalea maripa 
palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high beta-carotene content  it is not to be confused with palm kernel oil derived from the kernel of the same fruit  2  or coconut oil derived from the kernel of the coconut palm  cocos nucifera   the differences are in color  raw palm kernel oil lacks carotenoids and is not red   and in saturated fat content  palm mesocarp oil is 41  saturated  while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81  and 86  saturated fats  respectively 
along with coconut oil  palm oil is one of the few highly saturated vegetable fats and is semi-solid at room temperature  3 
palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of africa  southeast asia and parts of brazil  its use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is widespread because of its lower cost 4  and the high oxidative stability  saturation  of the refined product when used for frying  5  6 
the use of palm oil in food products has attracted the concern of environmental activist groups  the high oil yield of the trees has encouraged wider cultivation  leading to the clearing of forests in parts of indonesia and malaysia in order to make space for oil-palm monoculture  7  this has resulted in significant acreage losses of the natural habitat of the orangutan  of which both species are endangered  one species in particular  the sumatran orangutan  has been listed as critically endangered  8  in 2004  an industry group called the roundtable on sustainable palm oil  rspo  was formed to work with the palm oil industry to address these concerns  9  additionally  in 1992  in response to concerns about deforestation  the government of malaysia pledged to limit the expansion of palm oil plantations by retaining a minimum of half the nation s land as forest cover  10  11

history edit 
oil palms  elaeis guineensis  
human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years  in the late 1800s  archaeologists discovered a substance that they concluded was originally palm oil in a tomb at abydos dating back to 3,000 bce  12  it is believed that arab traders brought the oil palm to egypt  13  some argue that it is not possible that arab traders could have brought the oil palm to ancient egypt  as the arabs did not settle in africa until the 8th century ce  it is more likely that the oil palm was brought to ancient egypt  kemet  by its founding peoples who migrated from other regions of the african continent  14 
palm oil from elaeis guineensiss has long been recognized in west and central african countries  and is widely used as a cooking oil  european merchants trading with west africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in europe 
palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by british traders  for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery during britain s industrial revolution  15 
palm oil formed the basis of soap products  such as lever brothers   now unilever   sunlight  soap  and the american palmolive brand  16 
by around 1870  palm oil constituted the primary export of some west african countries  such as ghana and nigeria  although this was overtaken by cocoa in the 1880s  citation needed 
composition edit 
fatty acids edit 
main article  fatty acid
palm oil  like all fats  is composed of fatty acids  esterified with glycerol  palm oil has an especially high concentration of saturated fat  specifically  of the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid palmitic acid  to which it gives its name  monounsaturated oleic acid is also a major constituent of palm oil  unrefined palm oil is a significant source of tocotrienol  part of the vitamin e family  17  18 
the approximate concentration of fatty acids in palm oil is  19

carotenes edit 
red palm oil is rich in carotenes  such as alpha-carotene  beta-carotene and lycopene  which give it a characteristic dark red color  18  20 
processing and use edit 
many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients derived from it  21 
refining edit 
see also  cooking oil refinement
after milling  various palm oil products are made using refining processes  first is fractionation  with crystallization and separation processes to obtain solid  stearin   and liquid  olein  fractions  22  then melting and degumming removes impurities  then the oil is filtered and bleached  physical refining clarification needed  removes smells and coloration to produce  refined  bleached and deodorized palm oil   rbdpo  and free sheer fatty acids  clarification needed  which are used in the manufacture of soaps  washing powder and other products  rbdpo is the basic palm oil product sold on the world s commodity markets  many companies fractionate it further to produce palm olein for cooking oil  or process it into other products  22 
red palm oil edit 
since the mid-1990s  red palm oil has been cold-pressed and bottled for use as cooking oil  and blended into mayonnaise and salad oil  23 
butter and trans fat substitute edit 
the highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions  making it a cheap substitute for butter or trans fats in uses where solid fat is desirable  such as the making of pastry dough and baked goods  a recent rise in the use of palm oil in the food industry has partly come from changed labelling requirements that have caused a switch away from using trans fats  24  palm oil has been found to be a reasonable replacement for trans fats  25  however  a small study conducted in 2009 found that palm oil may not be a good substitute for trans fats for individuals with already-elevated ldl levels  26  the usda agricultural research service states that palm oil is not a healthy substitute for trans fats  27 
biomass and bioenergy edit 
palm oil is used to produce both methyl ester and hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel  28  palm oil methyl ester is created through a process called transesterification  palm oil biodiesel is often blended with other fuels to create palm oil biodiesel blends  29  palm oil biodiesel meets the european en 14214 standard for biodiesels  28  hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel is produced by direct hydrogenolysis of the fat into alkanes and propane  the world s largest palm oil biodiesel plant is the finnish-operated neste oil biodiesel plant in singapore  which opened in 2011 and produces hydrodeoxygenated nexbtl biodiesel  30 
the organic waste matter that is produced when processing oil palm  including oil palm shells and oil palm fruit bunches  can also be used to produce energy  this waste material can be converted into pellets that can be used as a biofuel  31  additionally  palm oil that has been used to fry foods can be converted into methyl esters for biodiesel  the used cooking oil is chemically treated to create a biodiesel similar to petroleum diesel  32 
in wound care edit 
although palm oil is applied to wounds for its supposed antimicrobial effects  research does not confirm its effectiveness  33 
production edit 
in 2012  the annual revenue received by indonesia and malaysia together  the top two producers of palm oil  was  40 billion  34  between 1962 and 1982 global exports of palm oil increased from around half a million to 2.4 million tonnes annually and in 2008 world production of palm oil and palm kernel oil amounted to 48 million tonnes  according to fao forecasts by 2020 the global demand for palm oil will double  and triple by 2050  35

indonesia edit 
main article  palm oil production in indonesia
indonesia is the world s largest producer of palm oil  surpassing malaysia in 2006  producing more than 20.9 million tonnes  34  36  indonesia expects to double production by the end of 2030  9  at the end of 2010  60 percent of the output was exported in the form of crude palm oil  37  fao data show production increased by over 400  between 1994 and 2004  to over 8.66 million metric tonnes 
malaysia edit

nigeria edit 
as of 2011  nigeria was the third-largest producer  with approximately 2.3million hectares  5.710 6 acres  under cultivation  until 1934  nigeria had been the world s largest producer  both small- and large-scale producers participated in the industry  42  43 
thailand edit 
in 2013  thailand produced 2.0 million tonnes of crude palm oil on roughly 626 thousand hectares  thailand expects to produce 11 million tonnes of fresh palm nuts in 2016  down from more than 12 million in 2015  the shortfall due to thailand s drought  44 
colombia edit 
in the 1960s  about 18,000 hectares  69sqmi  were planted with palm  colombia has now become the largest palm oil producer in the americas  and 35  of its product is exported as biofuel  in 2006  the colombian plantation owners  association  fedepalma  reported that oil palm cultivation was expanding to 1,000,000 hectares  3,900sqmi   this expansion is being funded  in part  by the united states agency for international development to resettle disarmed paramilitary members on arable land  and by the colombian government  which proposes to expand land use for exportable cash crops to 7,000,000 hectares  27,000sqmi  by 2020  including oil palms  fedepalma states that its members are following sustainable guidelines  45 
some afro-colombians claim that some of these new plantations have been expropriated from them after they had been driven away through poverty and civil war  while armed guards intimidate the remaining people to further depopulate the land  with coca production and trafficking following in their wake  46 
other countries edit 
a satellite image showing deforestation in malaysian borneo to allow the plantation of oil palm 
benin edit 
palm is native to the wetlands of western africa  and south benin already hosts many palm plantations  its  agricultural revival programme  has identified many thousands of hectares of land as suitable for new oil palm export plantations  in spite of the economic benefits  non-governmental organisations  ngos   such as nature tropicale  claim biofuels will compete with domestic food production in some existing prime agricultural sites  other areas comprise peat land  whose drainage would have a deleterious environmental impact  they are also concerned genetically modified plants will be introduced into the region  jeopardizing the current premium paid for their non-gm crops  47  48 
cameroon edit 
cameroon had a production project underway initiated by herakles farms in the us  49  however  the project was halted under the pressure of civil society organizations in cameroon  before the project was halted  herakles left the roundtable on sustainable palm oil early in negotiations  50  the project has been controversial due to opposition from villagers and the location of the project in a sensitive region for biodiversity 
kenya edit 
kenya s domestic production of edible oils covers about a third of its annual demand  estimated at around 380,000 metric tonnes  the rest is imported at a cost of around us 140 million a year  making edible oil the country s second most important import after petroleum  since 1993 a new hybrid variety of cold-tolerant  high-yielding oil palm has been promoted by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations in western kenya  as well as alleviating the country s deficit of edible oils while providing an important cash crop  it is claimed to have environmental benefits in the region  because it does not compete against food crops or native vegetation and it provides stabilisation for the soil  51 
ghana edit 
ghana has a lot of palm nut species  which may become an important contributor to the agriculture of the region  although ghana has multiple palm species  ranging from local palm nuts to other species locally called agric  it was only marketed locally and to neighboring countries  production is now expanding as major investment funds are purchasing plantations  because ghana is considered a major growth area for palm oil 
markets edit

according to the hamburg-based oil world trade journal  citation needed  in 2008 global production of oils and fats stood at 160 million tonnes  palm oil and palm kernel oil were jointly the largest contributor  accounting for 48 million tonnes  or 30  of the total output  soybean oil came in second with 37 million tonnes  23    about 38  of the oils and fats produced in the world were shipped across oceans  of the 60.3 million tonnes of oils and fats exported around the world  palm oil and palm kernel oil made up close to 60   malaysia  with 45  of the market share  dominated the palm oil trade 
food label regulations edit 
previously  palm oil could be listed as  vegetable fat  or  vegetable oil  on food labels in the european union  eu   from december 2014  food packaging in the eu is no longer allowed to use the generic terms  vegetable fat  or  vegetable oil  in the ingredients list  food producers are required to list the specific type of vegetable fat used  including palm oil  vegetable oils and fats can be grouped together in the ingredients list under the term  vegetable oils  or  vegetable fats  but this must be followed by the type of vegetable origin  e g  palm  sunflower or rapeseed  and the phrase  in varying proportions   52 
supply chain institutions edit 
the roundtable on sustainable palm oil  rspo  was established in 2004 53  following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts resulting from palm oil production  the organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production  54  products containing certified sustainable palm oil  cspo  can carry the rspo trademark  55  members of the rspo include palm oil producers  environmental groups  and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products  53  54 
the rspo is applying different types of programmes to supply palm oil to producers  56 
book and claim  no guarantee that the end product contains certified sustainable palm oil  supports rspo-certified growers and farmers
identity preserved  the end user is able to trace the palm oil back to a specific single mill and its supply base  plantations 
segregated  this option guarantees that the end product contains certified palm oil
mass balance  the refinery is only allowed to sell the same amount of mass balance palm oil as the amount of certified sustainable palm oil purchased
greenpalm is one of the retailers executing the book and claim supply chain and trading programme  it guarantees that the palm oil producer is certified by the rspo  through greenpalm the producer can certify a specified amount with the greenpalm logo  the buyer of the oil is allowed to use the rspo and the greenpalm label for sustainable palm oil on his products  56 
nutrition and health edit 
palm oil is also an important source of calories and a food staple in poor communities  57  58  59  however its overall health impacts  particularly in relation to cardiovascular disease  are controversial and subject to ongoing research 
much of the palm oil that is consumed as food is cooking oil  to some degree oxidized rather than in the fresh state  and this oxidation appears to be responsible for the health risk associated with consuming palm oil  60 
cardiovascular disease edit 
several studies have linked palm oil to higher risks of cardiovascular disease including a 2005 study conducted in costa rica which indicated that replacing palm oil in cooking with polyunsaturated non-hydrogenated oils could reduce the risk of heart attacks  61  and a 2011 analysis of 23 countries which showed that for each kilogram of palm oil added to the diet annually there was an increase in ischemic heart disease deaths  68 deaths per 100,000 increase  though the increase was much smaller in high-income countries  62 
palmitic acid edit 
according to studies reported on by the center for science in the public interest  cspi   excessive intake of palmitic acid  which makes up 44 percent of palm oil  increases blood cholesterol levels and may contribute to heart disease  63  the cspi also reported that the world health organization and the us national heart  lung and blood institute have encouraged consumers to limit the consumption of palmitic acid and foods high in saturated fat  57  63  according to the world health organization  evidence is convincing that consumption of palmitic acid increases risk of developing cardiovascular diseases  placing it in the same evidence category as trans fatty acids  64 
comparison to trans fats edit 
in response to negative reports on palm oil many food manufacturers transitioned to using hydrogenated vegetable oils in their products  which have also come under scrutiny for the impact these oils have on health  65  a 2006 study supported by the national institutes of health and the usda agricultural research service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats  trans fats  in the food industry  because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of ldl cholesterol and apolipoprotein b just as trans fat does  26  66  however  according to two reports published in 2010 by the journal of the american college of nutrition palm oil is again an accepted replacement for hydrogenated vegetable oils 65  and a natural replacement for partially hydrogenated vegetable oils  which are a significant source of trans fats  67 
comparison with animal saturated fat edit 
not all saturated fats have equally cholesterolemic effects  68  studies have indicated that consumption of palm olein  which is more unsaturated  reduces blood cholesterol when compared to sources of saturated fats like coconut oil  dairy and animal fats  68  69 
acrolein edit 
a 2009 study 70  tested the emission rates of acrolein  a toxic and malodorous breakdown product from glycerol  from the deep-frying of potatoes in red palm  olive  and polyunsaturated sunflower oils  the study found higher acrolein emission rates from the polyunsaturated sunflower oil  the scientists characterized red palm oil as  mono-unsaturated   and lower rates from both palm and olive oils  the world health organization established a tolerable oral acrolein intake of 7.5mg day per kilogram of body weight  although acrolein occurs in french fries  the levels are only a few micrograms per kilogram  a 2011 study concluded a health risk from acrolein in food is unlikely  71 
social and environmental impacts edit

social edit 
in borneo  the forest  f   is being replaced by oil palm plantations  g   these changes are irreversible for all practical purposes  h  
the palm oil industry has had both positive and negative impacts on workers  indigenous peoples and residents of palm oil-producing communities  palm oil production provides employment opportunities  and has been shown to improve infrastructure  social services and reduce poverty  72  73  74  however  in some cases  oil palm plantations have developed lands without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land  resulting in social conflict  75  76  77  the use of illegal immigrants in malaysia has also raised concerns about working conditions within the palm oil industry  78  79  80 
some social initiatives use palm oil cultivation as part of poverty alleviation strategies  examples include the un food and agriculture organisation s hybrid oil palm project in western kenya  which improves incomes and diets of local populations  81  and malaysia s federal land development authority and federal land consolidation and rehabilitation authority  which both support rural development  82 
food vs  fuel edit 
main article  food vs  fuel
the use of palm oil in the production of biodiesel has led to concerns that the need for fuel is being placed ahead of the need for food  leading to malnourishment in developing nations  this is known as the food versus fuel debate  according to a 2008 report published in the renewable and sustainable energy reviews  palm oil was determined to be a sustainable source of both food and biofuel  the production of palm oil biodiesel does not pose a threat to edible palm oil supplies  83  according to a 2009 study published in the environmental science and policy journal  palm oil biodiesel might increase the demand for palm oil in the future  resulting in the expansion of palm oil production  and therefore an increased supply of food  84 
environmental edit

palm oil cultivation has been criticized for impacts on the natural environment  85  86  including deforestation  loss of natural habitats  87  which has threatened critically endangered species such as the orangutan 88  89  and sumatran tiger  90  and increased greenhouse gas emissions  86  91  many palm oil plantations are built on top of existing peat bogs  and clearing the land for palm oil cultivation contributes to rising greenhouse gas emissions  91  92 
efforts to portray palm oil cultivation as sustainable have been made by organizations including the roundtable on sustainable palm oil  93  an industry group  and the malaysian government  which has committed to preserve 50 percent of its total land area as forest  10  according to research conducted by the tropical peat research laboratory  a group studying palm oil cultivation in support of the industry  94  oil palm plantations act as carbon sinks  converting carbon dioxide into oxygen 95  and  according to malaysia s second national communication to the united nations framework convention on climate change  the plantations contribute to malaysia s status as a net carbon sink  96 
environmental groups such as greenpeace and friends of the earth oppose the use of palm oil biofuels  claiming that the deforestation caused by oil palm plantations is more damaging for the climate than the benefits gained by switching to biofuel and utilizing the palms as carbon sinks  92  97  98 
roundtable on sustainable palm oil  rspo  edit 
main article  roundtable on sustainable palm oil
roundtable no 2  rt2  in zurich in 2005 
the roundtable on sustainable palm oil  rspo  was created in 2004 53  following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts related to palm oil production  the organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production  54  products containing certified sustainable palm oil  cspo  can carry the rspo trademark  55  members of the rspo include palm oil producers  environmental groups and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products  53  54 
palm oil growers who produce certified sustainable palm oil have been critical of the organization because  though they have met rspo standards and assumed the costs associated with certification  the market demand for certified palm oil remains low  54  55  low market demand has been attributed to the higher cost of certified sustainable palm oil  leading palm oil buyers to purchase cheaper non-certified palm oil  palm oil is mostly fungible  in 2011  12  of palm oil produced was certified  sustainable   though only half of that had the rspo label  99  even with such a low proportion being certified  greenpeace has argued that confectioners are avoiding responsibilities on sustainable palm oil  because it says that rspo standards fall short of protecting rain forests and reducing greenhouse gases  100
