nevada solar one is a concentrated solar power plant  with a nominal capacity of 64mw and maximum steam turbine power output up to 72mw net  75mw gross   spread over an area of 400 acres  160ha   the projected co2 emissions avoided is equivalent to taking approximately 20,000 cars off the road annually  the project required an investment of  266 million usd  1  and the project officially went to operation in june 2007  2  electricity production is estimated to be 134 million kilowatt hours per year  3 
it is the second solar thermal energy  ste  power plant built in the united states in more than 16 years  4  and the largest ste plant built in the world since 1991  5  it is located in eldorado valley in the southwest fringe of boulder city  nevada  and was built in that city s energy resource zone  which requires renewable generation as part of plant development permits  nevada solar one was approved as part of duke energy s larger el dorado energy project that built 1 gw of electrical generation capacity  the solar trough generation was built by acciona solar power  a partially owned subsidiary of spanish conglomerate acciona energy  6  lauren engineers   constructors  abilene  tx  was the epc contractor for the project  7  acciona purchased a 55 percent stake in solargenix  formerly duke solar  and acciona owns 95 percent of the project  8  nevada solar one is unrelated to the solar one power plant in california

history edit 
in 2006  located 30 miles north of tucson  arizona public service s saguaro solar facility opened  with 1 mwof electrical generation capacity  9  nevada solar one went online for commercial use on june 27  2007  it uses similar technology and was constructed over a period of 16 months  the total project site is approximately 400 acres  0.6mi   1.6km   while the solar collectors cover 300 acres  1.2km2  
technology edit 
nevada solar one uses proprietary technology to track the suns location and concentrate its rays during peak demand hours  the plant uses 760 parabolic trough concentrators with more than 182,000 mirrors that concentrate the suns rays onto more than 18,240 receiver tubes placed at the focal axis of the troughs and containing a heat transfer fluid  solar receivers   fluid that heats up to 735f  391c  flows through these tubes and is used to produce steam that drives a siemens sst-700 10  steam turbine  adapted to the specific requirements of the csp technology  11  which is connected to a generator to produce electricity 
the mirrors are manufactured by flabeg ag in germany  12  in contrast to the power tower concentrator concept that california s original solar one project uses  the specially coated tubes  made of glass and steel  were designed and produced by solel solar systems 13  as well as by schott glass in germany  14  motion control was supplied by parker hannifin  from components by ansco machine company 
solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands  such as the southwestern united states  using thermal energy storage systems  solar thermal operating periods can be extended to meet base load needs  15  given nevada s land and sun resources the state has the theoretical ability to have more than 600gw of electrical generation capacity using solar thermal concentrators like those used by nevada solar one  16  it has been proposed that massive expansion of solar plants such as nevada solar one has the potential to provide sufficient electricity to power the entire united states  17 
parabolic concentrator facilities have been successfully operating in california s mojave desert commercially since 1984 with a combined generating capacity of 354mw from the solar energy generating systems  about 30 parabolic trough power plants are operating in spain  see solar power in spain  and more are in construction or proposed  and two 110mw plants in israel  18  19

nevada solar one in fiction edit 
in the video game fallout  new vegas the station is named  helios one  and is under the control of the new california republic  the station is depicted to be in bad shape and under the command of an uncompetent scientist called  fantastic   who mentions that the station s output is at 1  of its full capacity
