community choice aggregation  abbreviated cca  is a system adopted into law in the united states states of massachusetts  new york  ohio  california  new jersey  rhode island  and illinois  which allows cities  counties  and some special districts  to aggregate the buying power of individual customers within a defined jurisdiction in order to secure alternative energy supply contracts on a community-wide basis  but allowing consumers not wishing to participate to opt out  also known as community choice energy  cce   municipal aggregation  governmental aggregation  electricity aggregation  and community aggregation  ccas now serve nearly 5  of americans in over 1300 municipalities as of 2014  1 
ccas are local  not-for-profit  public agencies that take on the decision-making role about sources of energy for electricity generation  once established  ccas become the default service provider for the power mix delivered to customers  in a cca service territory  the incumbent utility continues to own and maintain the transmission and distribution infrastructure  metering  and billing  in some states  ccas may be considered de facto public utilities of a new form that aggregate regional energy demand and negotiate with competitive suppliers and developers  rather than the traditional utility business model based on monopolizing energy supply  in california  ccas are by legal definition  not utilities  and are legally defined in california law as electric service providers

significance edit 
ccas have set a number of national green power and climate protection records while reducing power bills  a rare combination that has won national renewable energy laboratory  nrel  and environmental protection agency  epa  recognition for achieving significantly higher renewable energy portfolios while maintaining rates that are competitive with conventional fossil and nuclear-based utility power  several major u s  population centers under cca have switched to energy portfolios that are an order of magnitude greener than local utilities or other direct access providers  but charge no premium above utility or direct access rates  ccas are therefore already conspicuous leaders in green power innovation  receiving u s  environmental protection agencys green power leadership awards for achievements in renewable energy  mce clean energy  oak park  il  cincinnati  oh   newer ccas in california like sonoma clean power and san francisco s cleanpowersf are increasingly focused on using the policy as a platform for financing and integrating a transition to local renewable energy sources rather than grid power  2 
early days edit 
in massachusetts  where the nation s first cca bill  senate 447  montigny  was first drafted by massachusetts senate energy committee director paul fenn in 1995 3  and enacted in 1997  4  the towns of cape cod and martha s vineyard formed the cape light compact and successfully lobbied for passage of the seminal cca legislation  two of the cape light compact founders  falmouth selectman matthew patrick and barnstable county commissioner rob o leary  were subsequently elected to the massachusetts house of representatives and senate respectively  between 1995 and 2000  fenn formed the american local power project and worked with patrick to draft and pass similar laws in ohio  new jersey  and other states  5 
former ferc commissioner nora brownell has called community choice aggregations the only great exceptions to the failure of electric deregulation in the u s  with every cca yet formed still in operation and charging ratepayers less per kilowatt hour than their investor-owned-utilities  ccas have proven to be reliable and capable of delivering greener power at competitive prices  ohios office of the consumers council has said that cca is the greatest success story in ohios competitive market  and new legislation to re-regulate utility rates in ohio will preserve cca even if other forms of competition are eliminated  in massachusetts  the success of the cape light compact has led to the formation of new ccas used in towns such as marlborough  massachusetts 
massachusetts edit 
the nation s first cca  the cape light compact  currently serves 200,000 customers  running aggressive and transparent energy efficiency programs and installing solar installations on cape cod schools  fire stations and libraries  the hampshire council of governments has filed petitions for municipal aggregation of electricity on behalf of 44 communities in berkshire  franklin  hampden  hampshire  and worcester counties  after approval by state regulators  the council will arrange supply for those customers who have not chosen an independent supplier  these include great barrington and washington in berkshire county  blandford  hampden  holland  monson  and montgomery in hampden county  chesterfield  cummington  goshen  granby  hadley  hatfield  huntington  middlefield  northampton  pelham  plainfield  westhampton  and williamsburg in hampshire county  charlemont  conway  deerfield  gill  heath  leverett  montague  northfield  rowe  warwick  wendell  and whately in franklin county  and barre  brookfield  charlton  east brookfield  hardwick  leicester  mendon  millville  new braintree  north brookfield  upton  and west brookfield in worcester county 
other towns and cities are working to complete the initial process  in addition to these communities  which have a combined population of over 165,000 people 
ohio edit 
in ohio  the nation s largest cca was formed shortly after 1999 when the state legislature adopted a cca law - the northeast ohio public energy council  nopec   made up of approximately 500,000 customers in 138 cities and towns across eight counties  procured a power supply contract that switched electric generation fuel supply from a mix of coal and nuclear power to a mix of natural gas and a small percentage of renewably powered electricity  announcing a 70  air pollution reduction in the region s power mix  the contract also included solar photovoltaic demonstration projects in each of the eight counties  nopec s contracting process was led by scott ridley  an energy consultant who had worked with fenn to develop community choice aggregation in massachusetts and was a consultant for the cape light compact 
california edit 
in 2002  california state legislature passed assembly bill 117  enabling community choice aggregation  cca   not only did the bill allow ccas  but it mandated that customers be automatically enrolled in their local cca  with an option to opt out 
in the early days of the california energy crisis  paul fenn  the massachusetts senate energy committee director who conducted the legal research and drafting of the original cca legislation  formed local power inc  6  and drafted new cca legislation for california  7  in a campaign organized by local power  the city and county of san francisco led oakland  berkeley  marin county  and a group of los angeles municipalities in adopting resolutions asking for a state cca law in response to the failure of california s deregulated electricity market  fenn s bill was sponsored by then assembly member carole migden  d-san francisco  in 2001  and the bill became law  ab117  in september  2002  8 
cca formation in california was delayed by initial political opposition by the state s investor-owned utilities  in june 2010  pacific gas   electric sponsored a proposition  proposition 16  to make it more difficult for local entities to form either municipal utilities or ccas by requiring a two-thirds vote of the electorate rather than a simple majority  for a public agency to enter the retail power business  9  although pg e contributed over  46 million in an effort to pass the initiative  prop 16 s opponents  led by local power inc  and the utility reform network  10  had access to less than  100,000   11  12  proposition 16 was defeated 
san francisco adopted a cca ordinance drafted by fenn  86-04  tom ammiano  in 2004  creating a cca program to build 360 megawatts  mw  of solar  green distributed generation  wind generation  and energy efficiency and demand response to serve san francisco ratepayers using solar bonds  13  specifically  the ordinance combined the power purchasing authority of cca with a revenue bond authority also developed by fenn to expand the power of cca  known as the h bond authority  san francisco charter section 9.107.8  ammiano   to allow the cca to finance new green power infrastructure  worth approximately  1 billion  in 2007 the city adopted a detailed cca plan also written primarily by fenn  ordinance 447-07  ammiano and mirkarimi   which established a 51  renewable portfolio standard by 2017 for san francisco  14  over the following decade  sonoma and san francisco worked with fenn s company  local power inc  on program designs focused on achieving energy localization through renewables and energy efficiency  15 
inspired by climate protection efforts  cca has spread to cities throughout the bay area and the state  in 2007  40 california local governments were in the process of exploring cca  virtually all of them seeking to double  triple or quadruple the green power levels  renewable portfolio standard  or  rps  of the state s three investor-owned utilities 
in april  2014  assemblymember steve bradford  d-gardena  introduced legislation  ab 2145  that would sharply limit the ability of ccas to enroll customers  cca advocates and a broad coalition of local governments  business  and environmental organization rose up in opposition and defeated ab 2145  16  ab 2145 passed in the california assembly but died in the senate on august 30  2014 when the senate s legislative session was ended without it coming up for a vote  17 
marin clean energy edit 
marin county launched california s first cca program  marin clean energy  on may 7  2010  offering 50 -100  renewable energy at competitive prices  marin clean energy  mce  now serves approximately 175,000 customers in marin county  unincorporated napa county and the cities of benicia  el cerrito  san pablo  and richmond 
mce is helping to strengthen and democratize california s energy economy  as california s first cca program  mce is charting the course for a new  highly innovative approach to electricity service in the bay area  the organization s mission is to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by expanding access to affordable  renewable energy and energy efficiency programs while creating local economic and workforce benefits 
sonoma clean power edit 
the sonoma county-based center for climate protection formally introduced the idea of pursuing cca in sonoma county in the 2008 community climate action plan  in 2011  the sonoma county water agency funded the production of a feasibility study to study the question  the feasibility study was favorable and after much public review and the formation of a joint powers authority to administer the agency  sonoma clean power launched service on may 1  2014 18  offering power that is both greener and more locally sourced  at a lower cost than incumbent utility pg e  19  20  the county and all eight eligible cities in the county eventually joined  this includes cloverdale  cotati  petaluma  rohnert park  santa rosa  sebastopol  sonoma  and windsor  21 
in 2016 mendocino county voted to join sonoma clean power and the sonoma clean power governing board voted to accept mendocino county and the cities of fort bragg  willits  and point arena into the joint powers authority 
growing strength and expansion edit 
in 2016 the six existing community choice agencies  mce clean energy  sonoma clean power  lancaster choice energy  cleanpowersf  peninsula clean energy  and silicon valley clean energy formed a 501 c  6  non-profit trade association  the california community choice association  cal-cca  cal-cca s mission is to protect the interests of californias community choice electricity providers and their customers  cal-cca held its first meeting in san francisco on october 20  2016 
according to the clean power exchange  a project of the center for climate protection that tracks community choice expansion in california  by the close of 2016 26 of the 58 counties in california either had operating ccas  were on schedule to launch service  or were at some earlier stage of evaluation  over 300 cities are similarly engaged in operational or emerging ccas  an interactive map on the cleanpowerexhange org website updates cca developments in the state on a weekly basis 
illinois edit 
the state of illinois adopted a cca law in 2009  which has led to an explosion of communities providing electricity services to over 2/3 of the state s population as of 2014  including the city of chicago  whose mayor  rahm emanuel  is focusing the program on reducing coal power production and increasing renewable energy  22 
as of october 2013  671 illinois cities and towns  representing 80  of the state s residential electricity market  have utilized cca  23 
by the end of 2013  91 local governments in illinois  representing 1.7 million state residents  used the state s 2009 cca law to purchase 100  renewable electricity for their communities  24 
new jersey edit 
new jersey adopted a cca law in 2003  but did not see active formation of aggregations until 2013  when bergen county  jackson county  and fifteen other cities and counties started cca programs  focused on both lowering electric bills and in some cases greening their power supply  or both  25 
new york edit 
the new york state public service commission  psc  has identified cca as consistent with the stated goals of the regulatory reform reforming the energy vision  rev   and has stated that local energy planning gives municipalities better opportunities to realize the benefits of distributed energy resources enabled by rev  26  cca legislation had been filed in the new york state assembly in february 2014  27  followed by governor andrew cuomo s order directing the psc to implement cca directly under its own authority in december 2014  28 
in december 2014  non-profit organization sustainable westchester submitted a petition to the psc on behalf of its member municipalities to implement a cca demonstration program in westchester county  the psc granted the order on february 26  2015 authorizing sustainable westchester to put out an rfp and award contracts for both electric and natural gas supply for residents and small businesses within municipalities in the county that pass a resolution to join the cca   the sustainable westchester pilot is expected to provide valuable experience on cca design and outcomes that  in addition to the many comments in that proceeding  will assist the commission in making a determination on statewide implementation of cca   29 
the program launched in 2015  becoming the first operational cca in new york state  30  similar local cca organizing efforts are underway in ulster county  sullivan county  hudson highlands  and other communities  31
