a sketch of the pearl street station
pearl street station was the first central power plant in the united states  it was located at 255-257 pearl street in manhattan on a site measuring 50 by 100 feet  15 by 30m   1  just south of fulton street and fired by coal  it began with one direct current generator  and it started generating electricity on september 4  1882  serving an initial load of 400 lamps at 82 customers  2  by 1884  pearl street station was serving 508 customers with 10,164 lamps  1  the station was built by the edison illuminating company  which was headed by thomas edison  the station was originally powered by custom-made porter-allen high-speed steam engines designed to provide 175 horsepower at 700 rpm  3  but these proved to be unreliable with their sensitive governors  they were removed and replaced with new engines from armington   sims that proved to be much more suitable for edison s dynamos  4 
pearl street station not only holds the distinction of being the world s first central power plant  but it was also the world s first cogeneration plant  5  while the steam engines provided grid electricity  edison made use of the thermal byproduct by distributing steam to local manufacturers  and warming nearby buildings on the same manhattan block 
the station burned down in 1890  destroying all but one dynamo that is now kept in the greenfield village museum in dearborn  michigan  6 
in 1929 the edison company constructed three scale working models of the station  when a button was pushed  a motor turned the engines  generators  and other equipment in the model  a set of lamps connected to labelled buttons identified the various areas of the building  cut-outs in the side of the model building allowed examination of the boilers on the first level  reciprocating steam engines and dynamos on the reinforced second level  and the control and test gear on the third and fourth levels  the models were constructed to a scale of one-half inch to the foot and were 62 inches long  34 inches high and 13 inches wide  the models still exist and are on display at the smithsonian institution national museum of american history in washington  at the consolidated edison learning center in long island city  new york and at the henry ford museum in dearborn  michigan  up to 31 people worked on constructing the models which took about 6 months to complete  7
