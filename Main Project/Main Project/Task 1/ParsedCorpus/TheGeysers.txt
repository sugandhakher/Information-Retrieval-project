history edit 
the geysers resort hotel  ca 1880
for about 12,000 years  native american tribes built steambaths at the geysers and used the steam and hot water for healing purposes and cooking  1  when euro americans first entered the area  six indian tribes inhabited the area around the geysers  three bands of pomo people  two bands of wappo people  and the lake miwok people  1  the wappo also collected sulfur which they called te ke and a wappo village  named tekena ntsonoma  teke sulphur   nan well containing water   tso ground   no ma village  was located about 12 miles  19km  southeast of cloverdale and on the present-day sulphur creek  1 
the geysers were first seen by euro americans and named in 1847 during john fremont s survey of the sierra mountains and the great basin by william bell elliot who called the area  the geysers   although the geothermal features he discovered were not technically geysers  but fumaroles  2  between 1848 and 1854  1 
archibald c  godwin developed the geysers into a spa named the geysers resort hotel  which attracted tourists including ulysses s  grant  theodore roosevelt and mark twain  2  3  the resort declined in popularity in the mid 1880s  and rebranded itself to appeal to lower-income people  1  in 1938  the main building was destroyed in a landslide although the bar restaurant  small cabins and the swimming pool stayed open  despite another fire in march 1957  until about 1979  1  unocal corporation dismantled the remains of the resort in 1980  1 
five of the geysers facilities were damaged in the valley fire of september 2015  suffering  severe  damage to their cooling towers  the main power houses were not damaged  4 
geothermal development edit 
drilling a geothermal well  1977  usgs 
the geysers is the world s largest geothermal field 5  spanning an area of around 30 square miles  78km2  in sonoma  lake and mendocino counties in california  centered in the area of geyser canyon and cobb mountain  power from the geysers provides electricity to sonoma  lake  mendocino  marin  and napa counties  it is estimated that the development meets 60  of the power demand for the coastal region between the golden gate bridge and the oregon state line  6  unlike most geothermal resources  the geysers is a dry steam field which mainly produces superheated steam  5 
steam used at the geysers is produced from a greywacke sandstone reservoir  capped by a heterogeneous mix of low permeability rocks and underlaid by a silicic intrusion  2  7  gravity and seismic studies suggest that the source of heat for the steam reservoir is a large magma chamber over 4 miles  6.4km  beneath the surface  and greater than 8 miles  13km  in diameter  8 
the first geothermal wells drilled in geyser canyon were the first in the western hemisphere  1  the first power plant at the geysers was privately developed by the owner of the geysers resort 1  and opened in 1921  producing 250 kilowatts of energy to light the resort  2  in 1960  pacific gas and electric began operation of their 11-megawatt plant at the geysers  9  the original turbine lasted for more than 30years and produced 11mw net power  10 
by 1999 the steam to power extraction had begun to deplete the geysers steam field and production began to drop  2  however  since october 16  1997  the geysers steam field has been recharged by injection of treated sewage effluent  producing approximately 77 megawatts of capacity in 2004  11  the effluent is piped up to 50 miles  80km  from its source at the lake county sanitation waste water treatment plants and added to the geysers steam field via geothermal injection  11  in 2004  85  of the effluent produced by four waste-water treatment plants serving 10 lake county communities was diverted to the geysers steam field  11  injecting treated water into the geysers field increases the amount of power that can be generated  11 
the injection of wastewater to the geysers protects local waterways and clear lake by diverting effluent which used to be put into surface waters  11  and has produced electricity without releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere  2 
seismicity edit 
according to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory earth sciences division  seismicity was very low prior to the use of the geyser steam field for geothermal energy  although this may have been the result of low seismic coverage of the area  12  before 1969  there were no earthquakes above magnitude 2 recorded by the united states geological survey  usgs  in an approximately 70 square miles  180km2  area around the geysers  12  studies have shown that injecting water into the geysers field produces earthquakes from magnitude 0.5 to 3.0  although a 4.6 occurred in 1973 and magnitude four events increased thereafter  12  even with increasing injection rates over time  the rate of magnitude 3 earthquakes has remained relatively unchanged since the 1980s  12  although the amount of earthquakes has increased significantly  2  a magnitude 4.5 earthquake struck near the geysers on january 12  2014  13  despite the increases in the number of earthquakes and the fears of local residents  it is unlikely that a large earthquake will occur at the geysers since there is no large earthquake fault or fracture nearby  2 
geochemistry edit 
in 2005  abatement equipment was installed at two of the geysers plants to reduce the amount of mercury released by the waste vapor even though the amount released was below the legal limit for such releases  5  the geysers air monitoring programs  gamp  has shown limited releases of arsenic  but again below a significant level  5 
production edit 
power plants at the geysers are of the dry steam power plant type  where the steam directly powers the generator  5  in general  the geysers has 1517 mw 14  of active installed capacity with an average production factor of 63   955mw   15 
of nearly two dozen active plants in the geysers in 2013  calpine corporation operated 19 plants in 2004 16  but only 15 in 2013  17  two other plants are owned jointly by the northern california power agency and the city of santa clara s municipal electric utility  now called silicon valley power   the bottle rock power plant  owned by the u s  renewables group  was reopened in 2007  18  in july 2009  altarock energy planned to drill more than 2 miles  3.2km  down to create an  enhanced geothermal  project which was abandoned when federal agencies asked for review  2  another plant was under development by ram power corporation  formerly western geopower  in 2010  but after ram power lost both its ceo and cfo in 2013  it was seeking a buyer for its geysers property  19
