population growth rate edit 
the  population growth rate  is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period  expressed as a fraction of the initial population  specifically  population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period  often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period  this can be written as the formula  valid for a sufficiently small time interval

a positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing  while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing  a growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the perioda growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the birth rates  death rates  immigration rates  and age distribution between the two times  3 
a related measure is the net reproduction rate  in the absence of migration  a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing  while a net reproduction rate less than one  sub-replacement fertility  indicates that the population of females is decreasing

estimates of population evolution in different continents between 1950 and 2050  according to the united nations  the vertical axis is logarithmic and is in millions of people 
growth rate of world population  19502050  
in 2009  the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1   4  the cia world factbook gives the world annual birthrate  mortality rate  and growth rate as 1.86   0.78   and 1.08  respectively  5  the last 100years have seen a massive fourfold increase in the population  due to medical advances  lower mortality rates  and an increase in agricultural productivity 6  made possible by the green revolution 
the annual increase in the number of living humans peaked at 88.0million in 1989  then slowly declined to 73.9million in 2003  after which it rose again to 75.2million in 2006  in 2009  the human population increased by 74.6million  4  generally  developed nations have seen a decline in their growth rates in recent decades  though annual growth rates remain above 2  in poverty-stricken countries of the middle east and sub-saharan africa  and also in south asia  southeast asia  and latin america  7 
in some countries the population is declining  especially in eastern europe  mainly due to low fertility rates  high death rates and emigration  in southern africa  growth is slowing due to the high number of aids-related deaths  some western europe countries might also experience population decline  8  japan s population began decreasing in 2005  it now has the highest standard of living in the world  9 
the united nations population division projects world population to peak at over 10billion at the end of the 21st century  but sanjeev sanyal has argued that global fertility will fall below the replacement rate in the 2020s and that world population will peak below 9billion by 2050  followed by a long decline  10 
growth by country edit 
according to united nations population statistics  the world population grew by 30   or 1.6billion humans  between 1990 and 2010  11  in number of people the increase was highest in india  350million  and china  196million   population growth was among highest in the united arab emirates  315   and qatar  271    11

estimated size of human population from 10,000 bce to 2000 ce 
the majority of world population growth today is occurring in less developed countries 
according to the un s 2010 revision to its population projections  world population is projected to peak at 10.1 billion in 2100 compared to 7 billion in 2011  69  a 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the united nations population division projected that the world s population would reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter  70  however  some experts dispute the un s figures and have argued that birth rates will fall below replacement rate in the 2020s  according to their projections  population growth will be only sustained till the 2040s by rising longevity  but will peak below 9 bn by 2050  10
