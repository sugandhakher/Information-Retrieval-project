the german national action plan on energy efficiency  nape   german  nationale aktionsplan energieeffizienz  is the national energy efficiency action plan  neeap  for germany  1  the plan was commissioned under eu energy efficiency directive 2012/27 eu of the european union and released on 3 december 2014  2  under the plan  the german government offers an average increase of 2.1  year in macroeconomic energy productivity from 2008 to 2020  a  1  7 the exact reduction in primary energy use is therefore dependent on the rate of economic growth  the nape is part of the climate action programme2020  also approved on 3december 2014  4

targets edit 
the german government target under the national action plan on energy efficiency is specified in terms of energy productivity relative to gross domestic product  gdp   under the plan  the german government offers an average annual increase of 2.1  in macroeconomic energy productivity from 2008 to 2020  1  7 assuming an annual increase in gdp of 1.1   this represents a reduction in the energy-related share of primary energy consumption  in million tonnes crude oil equivalent  from 314.3mtoe  13.2ej  in 2008 to 276.6mtoe  11.6ej  in 2020  and corresponds to a reduction in final energy consumption from 220.7mtoe  9.24ej  in 2008 to 194.3mtoe  8.13ej  in 2020  these projections are covered by a caveat on economic and physical influences beyond the control of the government  1  7
this macroeconomic target is concurrent with other official energy efficiency and consumption targets not included in the national action plan on energy efficiency  in particular that of reducing primary energy consumption from 2008 levels by 20  in 2020 and by 50  in 2050  3  4
policy and monitoring edit 
the areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings  energy conservation for companies  consumer energy efficiency  and transport energy efficiency  the policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures  the central short-term measures of nape include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency  the raising of funding for building renovation  the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector  and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry  german industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution  5  6 
the government s fourth energy transition monitoring report  published in 2015  briefly reviews the national action plan on energy efficiency  3  813
government progress on its energy efficiency targets under nape and elsewhere  and on the energiewende more generally  is subject to external review  the 2015 review found energy efficiency developments in electricity and space heating were roughly on track  although developments in transport were not  but because the various instruments introduced specifically under nape were still in planning  testing  or early introduction  the review panel was unable to analyse their effectiveness  these instruments will be covered in future reviews  7  811
the 2016 annual report on nape  submitted to the eu on 28 april 2016  presented the major legislative and non-legislative energy efficiency measures adopted in the previous year  these include the energy efficiency network initiative aimed at companies  new obligations on non-smes to carry out regular energy audits  increased funding for energy efficient commercial renovation and new-build  and a new energy efficiency strategy for buildings  esg  that may result in an  almost climate-neutral building stock   8  3 in addition  the government is in the process of developing a scheme to promote heating optimization  an energy efficiency program for waste heat  programs to increase the energy efficiency in municipalities  and measures to improve the use of energy in rail transport  the report also noted that final energy consumption in the transport sector rose by 3.9pj between 2013 and 2014  as a result of the increase in passenger-kilometres by around 2.0  and tonne-kilometres by around 1.3   despite improvements in the final energy consumption per kilometre  8
