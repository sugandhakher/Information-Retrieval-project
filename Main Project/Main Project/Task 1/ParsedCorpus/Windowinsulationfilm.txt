window insulation film is a plastic film which can be applied to glass windows to reduce heat transfer  there are two types in common use designed to reduce heat flow via radiation and convection respectively

solar control film edit 
this works by reflecting the infra-red component of solar energy  often 700w sq m  and absorbing the uv component  some films are also silvered or tinted to reduce visible light 
typical absorption for a silvered film is 65  for visible and infra red with 99  for uv  this type of film sticks directly onto the glass 
convection control film edit 
a film is attached to the window frame to trap a pocket of air between the glass and the film  creating a double-glazed system with an insulating gap of still air  thermal conductivity of still air is 0.024 w m k and much lower than that of glass  0.96 w m k   1  factors which limit the performance of a double glazed window are gap width  convection within the cavity and radiative heat transfer across the gap which is largely independent of its width 
optimal gap width depends on the temperature difference imposed across the gap  a european standard  en 673  uses 20c difference between the inside and outside temperature which results in an optimal simulated gap width of about 17mm for a standard double glazed window  a us standard  nfrc  uses a 39c difference which yields a smaller optimal gap width of about 13mm  using the european standard a window with an ideal gap of 17mm has a simulated u-value of about 2.8 w m k  a window with a much smaller gap of 6mm has a u-value of about 3.3 w m k  while a single glazed window has a u-value of about 5.5 w m k  2   see also insulated glazing

one commonly used film is a heat-shrink plastic which is attached to the window frame using double-sided pressure-sensitive tape  a hair dryer is used to remove creases and improve optical clarity 
reduced heat flow also helps prevent condensation  3  4  5  which is triggered when the temperature of the inside surface falls below the dew point  assuming an outside temperature of 0c with wind velocity 15mph and inside temperature 20c condensation occurs at only 30 rh relative humidity with a single-glazed system compared with 60 rh for a double-glazed system  6  condensation also transfers additional heat  which can be significant 
applications edit 
 low-e  glass was introduced to the north american residential building market in the 1980s by a collaboration between rob hammon  now with biraenergy  and a windshield glass manufacturer  7  8 
solar control film is an effective way to control excessive sunshine during the summer months 
convection control film is often used in winter when the outgoing heat flow is more important  especially for single-glazed windows where the temperature difference is often sufficient to cause condensation
