schematics of a hybrid system
a stand-alone power system  saps or sps   also known as remote area power supply  raps   is an off-the-grid electricity system for locations that are not fitted with an electricity distribution system  typical saps include one or more methods of electricity generation  energy storage  and regulation 
electricity is typically generated by one or more of the following methods 
photovoltaic system using solar panels
wind turbine
geothermal source
micro combined heat and power
micro hydro
diesel or biofuel generator
storage is typically implemented as a battery bank  but other solutions exist including fuel cells  power drawn directly from the battery will be direct current extra low voltage  dc elv   and this is used especially for lighting as well as for dc appliances  an inverter is used to generate ac low voltage  which more typical appliances can be used with

stand-alone photovoltaic power systems are independent of the utility grid and may use solar panels only or may be used in conjunction with a diesel generator  a wind turbine or batteries  1  2

types edit 
the two types of stand-alone photovoltaic power systems are direct-coupled system without batteries and stand alone system with batteries 
direct-coupled system edit 
the basic model of a direct coupled system consists of a solar panel connected directly to a dc load  as there are no battery banks in this setup  energy is not stored and hence it is capable of powering common appliances like fans  pumps etc  only during the day  mppts are generally used to efficiently utilize the sun s energy especially for electrical loads like positive-displacement water pumps  impedance matching is also considered as a design criterion in direct-coupled systems  1  3 
stand alone system with batteries edit 
schematic of a stand-alone pv system with battery and charger
in stand-alone photovoltaic power systems  the electrical energy produced by the photovoltaic panels cannot always be used directly  as the demand from the load does not always equal the solar panel capacity  battery banks are generally used  the primary functions of a storage battery in a stand-alone pv system are 
energy storage capacity and autonomy  to store energy when there is an excess is available and to provide it when required 
voltage and current stabilization  to provide stable current and voltage by eradicating transients 
supply surge currents  to provide surge currents to loads like motors when required  4 
hybrid system edit

the hybrid power plant is a complete electrical power supply system that can be easily configured to meet a broad range of remote power needs  there are three basic elements to the system - the power source  the battery  and the power management center  sources for hybrid power include wind turbines  diesel engine generators  and solar pv systems  the battery allows autonomous operation by compensating for the difference between power production and use  the power management center regulates power production from each of the sources  controls power use by classifying loads  and protects the battery from service extremes  5  6 
system monitoring edit 
monitoring photovoltaic systems can provide useful information about their operation and what should be done to improve performance  but if the data are not reported properly  the effort is wasted  to be helpful  a monitoring report must provide information on the relevant aspects of the operation in terms that are easily understood by a third party  appropriate performance parameters need to be selected  and their values consistently updated with each new issue of the report  in some cases it may be beneficial to monitor the performance of individual components in order to refine and improve system performance  or be alerted to loss of performance in time for preventative action  for example  monitoring battery charge discharge profiles will signal when replacement is due before downtime from system failure is experienced  7 
iec standard 61724 edit 
iec has provided a set of monitoring standards called the  standard for photovoltaic system performance monitoring   iec 61724   it focusses on the photovoltaic system s electrical performance and it does not address hybrids or prescribe a method for ensuring that performance assessments are equitable  8 
performance assessment edit 
performance assessment involves 
data collection  which is a straightforward process of measuring parameters 
evaluation of that data in a manner that provides useful information 
dissemination of useful information to the end user  7 
load related problems edit 
the wide range of load related problems identified are classified into the following types 
wrong selection  some loads cannot be used with stand-alone pv systems 
house wiring  inadequate or low quality wiring and protection devices can affect the system s response 
low efficiency  low efficiency loads may increase energy consumption 
stand-by loads  stand-by mode of some loads waste energy 
start-up  high current drawn by some loads during start-up current spikes during the start-up can overload the system temporarily 
reactive power  the circulating current can differ from the current consumed when capacitive or inductive loads are used 
harmonic distortion  non-linear loads may create distortion of the inverter waveform 
mismatch between load and inverter size  when a higher rated inverter is used for a lower capacity load  overall efficiency is reduced  9
