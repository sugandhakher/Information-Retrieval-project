sustainable markets can be loosely defined as those that contribute to stronger livelihoods and more sustainable environments  in linking with the pursuit of sustainable development  such markets have a multiple focus on social  environmental and economic outcomes  sustainable markets aim to reflect the true costs  or externalities  of natural resource degradation  environmental pollution  and promote just and safe labour practices  1

key tools edit 
in transitioning to sustainable markets  formal rules sometimes called market governance mechanisms  mgms are key potential tools to shape and govern markets  examples could include fairtrade certification  sustainable reporting and metrics  payments for ecosystem services or other market-based instruments  mgms change the behaviour of consumers  investors or producers so that their decisions result in more sustainable outcomes  2  mgms could provide economic signals or incentives  for example in pricing externalities  regulatory mechanisms could prohibit or require certain practices by consumers or producers  or cooperative mechanisms could create voluntary or more formal partnerships around environmental norms or standards 
debates edit 
there are a number of contentious issues and ongoing debates around sustainable markets  particularly in how to achieve sustainable markets  there are questions around the appropriate mix of policy instruments or mechanisms  and for which context for example  a developing world country may require specific mechanisms to build sustainable markets  particularly where more informal or fledging economies exists  these also involve wider debates over how economic globalisation and trade can benefit countries where local capacities or institutions are weak 
furthermore  there are unresolved debates over how much regulation or government intervention is appropriate in order to govern sustainable markets  for example  in pricing pollution like greenhouse gases  ghgs   there are competing arguments over whether there should be government-mandated taxes to limit pollution by economic disincentives or whether a market should determine the price to pollute  in many cases a mixture of both may be favourable 
broader questions remain over whether sustainable markets can ever fully account for environmental externalities  such as those associated with pollution  this relates to whether an economic model focused on gdp rather than wellbeing can truly bring about the transformation outlined in sustainable development  there have been suggestions that a move away from a pure focus on gdp is required  towards an emphasis represented in methods such as natural capital accounting
