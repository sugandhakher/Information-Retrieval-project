suds pond with reed-bed near housing  dunfermline  scotland 
a sustainable drainage system  suds  1  suds  suds 2  3   is designed to reduce the potential impact of new and existing developments with respect to surface water drainage discharges  the term sustainable urban drainage system 1  4  is not the accepted name  the  urban  reference having been removed so as to accommodate rural sustainable water management practices  5  6  7

background edit 
increasing urbanization has caused problems with increased flash flooding after sudden rain  as areas of vegetation are replaced by concrete  asphalt  or roofed structures  the area loses its ability to absorb rainwater  this rain is instead directed into surface water drainage systems  often overloading them and causing floods 
the idea behind suds is to try to replicate natural systems that use cost effective solutions with low environmental impact to drain away dirty and surface water run-off through collection  storage  and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment  such as into water courses  this is to counter the effects of conventional drainage systems that often allow for flooding  pollution of the environment  with the resultant harm to wildlife  and contamination of groundwater sources used to provide drinking water  the paradigm of suds solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage  requiring little or no energy input  except from environmental sources such as sunlight  etc    resilient to use  and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive  examples of this type of system are basins  shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it s not raining   rain-gardens  shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting   swales  shallow normally-dry  wide-based ditches   filter drains  gravel filled trench drain   bioretention basins  shallow depressions with gravel and or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium   reed beds and other wetland habitats that collect  store  and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife 
originally the term suds described the uk approach to sustainable urban drainage systems  these developments may not necessarily be in  urban  areas  and thus the  urban  part of suds is now usually dropped to reduce confusion  other countries have similar approaches in place using a different terminology such as best management practice  bmp  and low-impact development in the united states  8  and water-sensitive urban design in australia  
suds use the following techniques 
source control
permeable paving such as pervious concrete
storm water detention
storm water infiltration
evapo-transpiration  e g  from a green roof 
a common misconception of suds systems is that they reduce flooding on the development site  in fact the suds system is designed to reduce the impact that the surface water drainage system of one site has on other sites  for instance  sewer flooding is a problem in many places  paving or building over land can result in flash flooding  this happens when flows entering a sewer exceed its capacity and it overflows  the suds system aims to minimise or eliminate discharges from the site  thus reducing the impact  the idea being that if all development sites incorporated suds then urban sewer flooding would be less of a problem  unlike traditional urban stormwater drainage systems  suds can also help to protect and enhance ground water quality 
history edit 
the first sustainable drainage system to utilise a full management train including source control in the uk was oxford services designed by robert bray associates  specialist suds consultants  9
