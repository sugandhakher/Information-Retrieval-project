etymology
statue representing africa at palazzo ferreria  in valletta  malta
afri was a latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of africa  which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the mediterranean  ancient libya   9  10  this name seems to have originally referred to a native libyan tribe  see terence biography for discussion  the name is usually connected with hebrew or phoenician afar  dust   but a 1981 hypothesis 11  has asserted that it stems from the berber ifri  plural ifran   cave   in reference to cave dwellers  12  the same word 12  may be found in the name of the banu ifran from algeria and tripolitania  a berber tribe originally from yafran  also known as ifrane  in northwestern libya  13 
under roman rule  carthage became the capital of the province of africa proconsularis  which also included the coastal part of modern libya  14  the latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land  e g   in celtica from celtae  as used by julius caesar   the later muslim kingdom of ifriqiya  modern-day tunisia  also preserved a form of the name 
according to the romans  africa lay to the west of egypt  while  asia  was used to refer to anatolia and lands to the east  a definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer ptolemy  85165 ad   indicating alexandria along the prime meridian and making the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and africa  as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent  the idea of  africa  expanded with their knowledge 
other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name  africa  
the 1st-century jewish historian flavius josephus  ant  1.15  asserted that it was named for epher  grandson of abraham according to gen  25 4  whose descendants  he claimed  had invaded libya 
isidore of seville in etymologiae xiv 5.2  suggests  africa comes from the latin aprica  meaning  sunny  
massey  in 1881  stated that africa is derived from the egyptian af-rui-ka  meaning  to turn toward the opening of the ka   the ka is the energetic double of every person and the  opening of the ka  refers to a womb or birthplace  africa would be  for the egyptians   the birthplace   15 
michle fruyt proposed 16  linking the latin word with africus  south wind   which would be of umbrian origin and mean originally  rainy wind  
robert r  stieglitz of rutgers university proposed   the name africa  derived from the latin  aphir-ic-a  is cognate to hebrew ophir   17

prehistory
main article  recent african origin of modern humans
lucy  an australopithecus afarensis skeleton discovered 24 november 1974 in the awash valley of ethiopia s afar depression
africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on earth  with the human species originating from the continent  18  19  during the mid-20th century  anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago  bp before present   fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man  such as australopithecus afarensis  radiometrically dated to approximately 3.93.0million years bp  20  paranthropus boisei  c  2.31.4million years bp  21  and homo ergaster  c  1.9million600,000 years bp  have been discovered  2 
after the evolution of homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years bp in africa  the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers  22  23  24  these first modern humans left africa and populated the rest of the globe during the out of africa ii migration dated to approximately 50,000 years bp  exiting the continent either across bab-el-mandeb over the red sea  25  26  the strait of gibraltar in morocco  27  or the isthmus of suez in egypt  28 
other migrations of modern humans within the african continent have been dated to that time  with evidence of early human settlement found in southern africa  southeast africa  north africa  and the sahara  29 
the size of the sahara has historically been extremely variable  with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climactic conditions  30  at the end of the ice ages  estimated to have been around 10,500 bc  the sahara had again become a green fertile valley  and its african populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-saharan africa  with rock art paintings depicting a fertile sahara and large populations discovered in tassili n ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia  31  however  the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 bc  the sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile  around 3500 bc  due to a tilt in the earth s orbit  the sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification  32  the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the second cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements  a major climatic recession occurred  lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern africa  since this time  dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and  increasingly during the last 200 years  in ethiopia 
the domestication of cattle in africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures  it is speculated that by 6000 bc  cattle were domesticated in north africa  33  in the sahara-nile complex  people domesticated many animals  including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from algeria to nubia 
around 4000 bc  the saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace  34  this climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification  this  in turn  decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of west africa  34 
by the first millennium bc  ironworking had been introduced in northern africa and quickly spread across the sahara into the northern parts of sub-saharan africa  35  and by 500 bc  metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa  ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa  although other regions didn t begin ironworking until the early centuries ad  copper objects from egypt  north africa  nubia  and ethiopia dating from around 500 bc have been excavated in west africa  suggesting that trans-saharan trade networks had been established by this date  34

following the conquest of north africa s mediterranean coastline by the roman empire  the area was integrated economically and culturally into the roman system  roman settlement occurred in modern tunisia and elsewhere along the coast  the first roman emperor native to north africa was septimius severus  born in leptis magna in present-day libyahis mother was italian roman and his father was punic  44 
christianity spread across these areas at an early date  from judaea via egypt and beyond the borders of the roman world into nubia  45  by ad 340 at the latest  it had become the state religion of the aksumite empire  syro-greek missionaries  who arrived by way of the red sea  were responsible for this theological development  46 
in the early 7th century  the newly formed arabian islamic caliphate expanded into egypt  and then into north africa  in a short while  the local berber elite had been integrated into muslim arab tribes  when the umayyad capital damascus fell in the 8th century  the islamic centre of the mediterranean shifted from syria to qayrawan in north africa  islamic north africa had become diverse  and a hub for mystics  scholars  jurists  and philosophers  during the above-mentioned period  islam spread to sub-saharan africa  mainly through trade routes and migration  47

in the forested regions of the west african coast  independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the muslim north  the kingdom of nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first  it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day nigeria and was ruled by the eze nri  the nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes  found at the town of igbo-ukwu  the bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century  50

slavery had long been practised in africa  55  56  between the 7th and 20th centuries  arab slave trade  also known as slavery in the east  took 18 million slaves from africa via trans-saharan and indian ocean routes  between the 15th and the 19th centuries  500 years   the atlantic slave trade took an estimated 712 million slaves to the new world  57  58  59  more than 1 million europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa between the 16th and 19th centuries  60 
in west africa  the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities  the gradual decline of slave-trading  prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the new world  increasing anti-slavery legislation in europe and america  and the british royal navy s increasing presence off the west african coast  obliged african states to adopt new economies  between 1808 and 1860  the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 africans who were aboard  61

in the late 19th century  the european imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent  creating many colonial territories  and leaving only two fully independent states  ethiopia  known to europeans as  abyssinia    and liberia  egypt and sudan were never formally incorporated into any european colonial empire  however  after the british occupation of 1882  egypt was effectively under british administration until 1922 
berlin conference
the berlin conference held in 188485 was an important event in the political future of african ethnic groups  it was convened by king leopold ii of belgium  and attended by the european powers that laid claim to african territories  it sought to end the european powers  scramble for africa  by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence  they set up the political divisions of the continent  by spheres of interest  that exist in africa today 
independence struggles
imperial rule by europeans would continue until after the conclusion of world war ii  when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence  independence movements in africa gained momentum following world war ii  which left the major european powers weakened  in 1951  libya  a former italian colony  gained independence  in 1956  tunisia and morocco won their independence from france  64  ghana followed suit the next year  march 1957   65  becoming the first of the sub-saharan colonies to be granted independence  most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade 
portugal s overseas presence in sub-saharan africa  most notably in angola  cape verde  mozambique  guinea-bissau and so tom and prncipe  lasted from the 16th century to 1975  after the estado novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in lisbon  rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the united kingdom in 1965  under the white minority government of ian smith  but was not internationally recognized as an independent state  as zimbabwe  until 1980  when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war  although south africa was one of the first african countries to gain independence  the state remained under the control of the country s white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994 
post-colonial africa
mobutu sese seko  zaire s longtime dictator  embezzled over  5 billion from his country 
today  africa contains 54 sovereign countries  most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of european colonialism  since colonialism  african states have frequently been hampered by instability  corruption  violence  and authoritarianism  the vast majority of african states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule  however  few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis  and many have instead cycled through a series of coups  producing military dictatorships 
great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups  and graft under these leaders  for political gain  many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts  some of which had been exacerbated  or even created  by colonial rule  in many countries  the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order  and it ruled many nations in africa during the 1970s and early 1980s  during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s  africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations  border and territorial disputes were also common  with the european-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts 
south african paratroops on a raid in angola during the south african border war
cold war conflicts between the united states and the soviet union  as well as the policies of the international monetary fund  citation needed  also played a role in instability  when a country became independent for the first time  it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers  many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid  while others in central and southern africa were supported by the united states  france or both  the 1970s saw an escalation of cold war intrigues  as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned themselves with the soviet union  and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements  in rhodesia  soviet and chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the zimbabwe patriotic front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country s white government  there was a major famine in ethiopia  when hundreds of thousands of people starved  some claimed that marxist economic policies made the situation worse  66  67  68  the most devastating military conflict in modern independent africa has been the second congo war  this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people  69  since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster  another notable tragic event is the 1994 rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered  aids in post-colonial africa has also been a prevalent issue 
in the 21st century  however  the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined  for instance  the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years  this has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms  the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations  mainly from china  70  which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries  seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline  several african economies are among the world s fastest growing as of 2016  a significant part of this growth  which is sometimes referred to as africa rising  can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone  71

the african union  au  is a 54-member federation consisting of all of africa s states except morocco  the union was formed  with addis ababa  ethiopia  as its headquarters  on 26 june 2001  the union was officially established on 9 july 2002 84  as a successor to the organisation of african unity  oau   in july 2004  the african union s pan-african parliament  pap  was relocated to midrand  in south africa  but the african commission on human and peoples  rights remained in addis ababa  there is a policy in effect to decentralize the african federation s institutions so that they are shared by all the states 
the african union  not to be confused with the au commission  is formed by the constitutive act of the african union  which aims to transform the african economic community  a federated commonwealth  into a state under established international conventions  the african union has a parliamentary government  known as the african union government  consisting of legislative  judicial and executive organs  it is led by the african union president and head of state  who is also the president of the pan-african parliament  a person becomes au president by being elected to the pap  and subsequently gaining majority support in the pap  the powers and authority of the president of the african parliament derive from the constitutive act and the protocol of the pan-african parliament  as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by african treaties and by international treaties  including those subordinating the secretary general of the oau secretariat  au commission  to the pap  the government of the au consists of all-union  federal   regional  state  and municipal authorities  as well as hundreds of institutions  that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution 
political associations such as the african union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent s many countries  extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of africa  often under the oversight of the state  most of such violations occur for political reasons  often as a side effect of civil war  countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the democratic republic of the congo  sierra leone  liberia  sudan  zimbabwe  and cte d ivoire

although it has abundant natural resources  africa remains the world s poorest and most underdeveloped continent  the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations  failed central planning  high levels of illiteracy  lack of access to foreign capital  and frequent tribal and military conflict  ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide   85  according to the united nations  human development report in 2003  the bottom 24 ranked nations  151st to 175th  were all african  86 
poverty  illiteracy  malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation  as well as poor health  affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the african continent  in august 2008  the world bank 87  announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of  1.25 per day  versus the previous measure of  1.00   80.5  of the sub-saharan africa population was living on less than  2.50  ppp  per day in 2005  compared with 85.7  for india  88 
sub-saharan africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty   1.25 per day   some 50  of the population living in poverty in 1981  200 million people   a figure that rose to 58  in 1996 before dropping to 50  in 2005  380 million people   the average poor person in sub-saharan africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day  and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973  89  indicating increasing poverty in some areas  some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments  but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors  90  91  92 
from 1995 to 2005  africa s rate of economic growth increased  averaging 5  in 2005  some countries experienced still higher growth rates  notably angola  sudan and equatorial guinea  all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity  the continent is believed to hold 90  of the world s cobalt  90  of its platinum  50  of its gold  98  of its chromium  70  of its tantalite  93  64  of its manganese and one-third of its uranium  94  the democratic republic of the congo  drc  has 70  of the world s coltan  a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones  the drc also has more than 30  of the world s diamond reserves  95  guinea is the world s largest exporter of bauxite  96  as the growth in africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture  it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels  in fact  the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity  97 
in recent years  the people s republic of china has built increasingly stronger ties with african nations and is africa s largest trading partner  in 2007  chinese companies invested a total of us 1 billion in africa  70

speakers of bantu languages  part of the nigercongo family  are the majority in southern  central and southeast africa  the bantu-speaking peoples from the sahel progressively expanded over most of sub-saharan africa  104  but there are also several nilotic groups in south sudan and east africa  the mixed swahili people on the swahili coast  and a few remaining indigenous khoisan   san  or  bushmen   and pygmy peoples in southern and central africa  respectively  bantu-speaking africans also predominate in gabon and equatorial guinea  and are found in parts of southern cameroon  in the kalahari desert of southern africa  the distinct people known as the bushmen  also  san   closely related to  but distinct from  hottentots   have long been present  the san are physically distinct from other africans and are the indigenous people of southern africa  pygmies are the pre-bantu indigenous peoples of central africa  105 
the peoples of west africa primarily speak nigercongo languages  belonging mostly to its non-bantu branches  though some nilo-saharan and afro-asiatic speaking groups are also found  the nigercongo-speaking yoruba  igbo  fulani  akan and wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential  in the central sahara  mandinka or mande groups are most significant  chadic-speaking groups  including the hausa  are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the sahara  and nilo-saharan communities  such as the songhai  kanuri and zarma  are found in the eastern parts of west africa bordering central africa 
the peoples of north africa consist of three main indigenous groups  berbers in the northwest  egyptians in the northeast  and nilo-saharan-speaking peoples in the east  the arabs who arrived in the 7th century ad introduced the arabic language and islam to north africa  the semitic phoenicians  who founded carthage  and hyksos  the indo-iranian alans  the indo- european greeks  romans  and vandals settled in north africa as well  significant berber communities remain within morocco and algeria in the 21st century  while  to a lesser extent  berber speakers are also present in some regions of tunisia and libya  106  the berber-speaking tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the saharan interior of north africa  in mauritania  there is a small but near-extinct berber community in the north and nigercongo-speaking peoples in the south  though in both regions arabic and arab culture predominates  in sudan  although arabic and arab culture predominate  it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke nilo-saharan  such as the nubians  fur  masalit and zaghawa  who  over the centuries  have variously intermixed with migrants from the arabian peninsula  small communities of afro-asiatic-speaking beja nomads can also be found in egypt and sudan  citation needed

in the horn of africa  some ethiopian and eritrean groups  like the amhara and tigrayans  collectively known as habesha  speak languages from the semitic branch of the afro-asiatic language family  while the oromo and somali speak languages from the cushitic branch of afro-asiatic 
prior to the decolonization movements of the post-world war ii era  europeans were represented in every part of africa  107  decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers  especially from algeria and morocco  1.6 million pieds-noirs in north africa   108  kenya  congo  109  rhodesia  mozambique and angola  110  between 1975 and 1977  over a million colonials returned to portugal alone  111  nevertheless  white africans remain an important minority in many african states  particularly zimbabwe  namibia  runion  and the republic of south africa  112  the country with the largest white african population is south africa  113  dutch and british diasporas represent the largest communities of european ancestry on the continent today  114 
european colonization also brought sizable groups of asians  particularly from the indian subcontinent  to british colonies  large indian communities are found in south africa  and smaller ones are present in kenya  tanzania  and some other southern and southeast african countries  the large indian community in uganda was expelled by the dictator idi amin in 1972  though many have since returned  the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin  often mixed with africans and europeans  the malagasy people of madagascar are an austronesian people  but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu  arab  indian and european origins  malay and indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in south africa as cape coloureds  people with origins in two or more races and continents   during the 20th century  small but economically important communities of lebanese and chinese 70  have also developed in the larger coastal cities of west and east africa  respectively  115

by most estimates  well over a thousand languages  unesco has estimated around two thousand  are spoken in africa  116  most are of african origin  though some are of european or asian origin  africa is the most multilingual continent in the world  and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple african languages  but one or more european ones as well  there are four major language families indigenous to africa 
the afroasiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the horn of africa  north africa  the sahel  and southwest asia 
the nilo-saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people  nilo-saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in chad  ethiopia  kenya  nigeria  sudan  south sudan  uganda  and northern tanzania

main article  culture of africa
some aspects of traditional african cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes  for example  african customs were discouraged  and african languages were prohibited in mission schools  117  leopold ii of belgium attempted to  civilize  africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft  117 
obidoh freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern african art  118  according to authors douglas fraser and herbert m  cole   the precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art    119  fraser and cole assert that  in igboland  some art objects  lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions  119  author chika okeke-agulu states that  the racist infrastructure of british imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign africa and modernist art    120  in soweto  the west rand administrative board established a cultural section to collect  read  and review scripts before performances could occur  121  editors f  abiola irele and simon gikandi comment that the current identity of african literature had its genesis in the  traumatic encounter between africa and europe    122  on the other hand  mhoze chikowero believes that africans deployed music  dance  spirituality  and other performative cultures to  re asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals  to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies    123 
there is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue african traditional cultures  under such movements as the african renaissance  led by thabo mbeki  afrocentrism  led by a group of scholars  including molefi asante  as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of vodou and other forms of spirituality
