the university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms  suites  and on-campus apartments  the university s campus master plan envisions housing about 60  of undergraduates  requiring an addition of 1700 beds  however  the state of new hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings  including dormitories 
undergraduate housing is divided into three areas  the hills  the valley and the timbers  formerly area i  area ii and area iii  respectively   there are also two undergraduate apartment complexes  the gables and woodside apartments  the university offers family housing in the forest park apartments and graduate housing in babcock hall  the second oldest dorm on campus is hetzel hall  named after the university s former president ralph d  hetzel  built in 1925  it is located near downtown durham
