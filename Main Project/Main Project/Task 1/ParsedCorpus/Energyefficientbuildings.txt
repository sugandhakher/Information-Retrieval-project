green building  also known as green construction or sustainable building  refers to both a structure and the using of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building s life-cycle  from siting to design  construction  operation  maintenance  renovation  and demolition  1  in other words  green building design involves finding the balance between homebuilding and the sustainable environment  this requires close cooperation of the design team  the architects  the engineers  and the client at all project stages  2  the green building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy  utility  durability  and comfort  3 
leadership in energy and environmental design  leed  is a set of rating systems for the design  construction  operation  and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the u s  green building council  other certificates system that confirms the sustainability of buildings is the british breeam  building research establishment environmental assessment method  for buildings and large scale developments  currently  world green building council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with world bank to promote green buildings in emerging markets through edge excellence in design for greater efficiencies market transformation program and certification  4 
although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures  the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by 
efficiently using energy  water  and other resources
protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity
reducing waste  pollution and environmental degradation 3 
a similar concept is natural building  which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally  5  other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture  sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs  6  although some green building programs don t address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes  others do  especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment  green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction 
a 2009 report by the u s  general services administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance  in addition  occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildings these are eco-friendly buildings  7

reducing environmental impact edit 
hanging gardens of one central park  sydney
globally buildings are responsible for a huge share of energy  electricity  water and materials consumption  the building sector has the greatest potential to deliver significant cuts in emissions at little or no cost  buildings account for 18   8  of global emissions today  or the equivalent of 9 billion tonnes of co2 annually  if new technologies in construction are not adopted during this time of rapid growth  emissions could double by 2050  according to the united nations environment program green building practices aim to reduce the environmental impact of building  since construction almost always degrades a building site  not building at all is preferable to green building  in terms of reducing environmental impact  the second rule is that every building should be as small as possible  the third rule is not to contribute to sprawl  even if the most energy-efficient  environmentally sound methods are used in design and construction 
buildings account for a large amount of land  according to the national resources inventory  approximately 107million acres  430,000km2  of land in the united states are developed  the international energy agency released a publication that estimated that existing buildings are responsible for more than 40  of the worlds total primary energy consumption and for 24  of global carbon dioxide emissions  9

goals of green building edit

taipei 101  the tallest and largest green building of leed platinum certification in the world since 2011 
the concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy  especially fossil oil  crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s  11  the rachel carson book  silent spring  12  published in 1962  is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building  13  the green building movement in the u s  originated from the need and desire for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly construction practices  there are a number of motives for building green  including environmental  economic  and social benefits  however  modern sustainability initiatives call for an integrated and synergistic design to both new construction and in the retrofitting of existing structures  also known as sustainable design  this approach integrates the building life-cycle with each green practice employed with a design-purpose to create a synergy among the practices used 
green building brings together a vast array of practices  techniques  and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health  it often emphasizes taking advantage of renewable resources  e g   using sunlight through passive solar  active solar  and photovoltaic equipment  and using plants and trees through green roofs  rain gardens  and reduction of rainwater run-off  many other techniques are used  such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of ground water 
while the practices or technologies employed in green building are constantly evolving and may differ from region to region  fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived  siting and structure design efficiency  energy efficiency  water efficiency  materials efficiency  indoor environmental quality enhancement  operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction  14  15  the essence of green building is an optimization of one or more of these principles  also  with the proper synergistic design  individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect 
on the aesthetic side of green architecture or sustainable design is the philosophy of designing a building that is in harmony with the natural features and resources surrounding the site  there are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings  specify  green  building materials from local sources  reduce loads  optimize systems  and generate on-site renewable energy 
life cycle assessment edit 
a life cycle assessment  lca  can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental  social and economic concerns 16  by assessing a full range of impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process  from extraction of raw materials through materials processing  manufacture  distribution  use  repair and maintenance  and disposal or recycling  impacts taken into account include  among others  embodied energy  global warming potential  resource use  air pollution  water pollution  and waste 
in terms of green building  the last few years have seen a shift away from a prescriptive approach  which assumes that certain prescribed practices are better for the environment  toward the scientific evaluation of actual performance through lca 
although lca is widely recognized as the best way to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings  iso 14040 provides a recognized lca methodology   it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes  despite the fact that embodied energy and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings 
in north america  lca is rewarded to some extent in the green globes rating system  and is part of the new american national standard based on green globes  ansi gbi 01-2010  green building protocol for commercial buildings  lca is also included as a pilot credit in the leed system  though a decision has not been made as to whether it will be incorporated fully into the next major revision  the state of california also included lca as a voluntary measure in its 2010 draft green building standards code 
although lca is often perceived as overly complex and time consuming for regular use by design professionals  research organizations such as bre in the uk and the athena sustainable materials institute in north america are working to make it more accessible 
in the uk  the bre green guide to specifications offers ratings for 1,500 building materials based on lca 
in north america  the athena ecocalculator for assemblies provides lca results for several hundred common building assembles based on data generated by its more complex parent software  the athena impact estimator for buildings   the ecocalculator is available free at www athenasmi org   athena software tools are especially useful early in the design process when material choices have far-reaching implications for overall environmental impact  they allow designers to experiment with different material mixes to achieve the most effective combination 
siting and structure design efficiency edit 
see also  sustainable design
the foundation of any construction project is rooted in the concept and design stages  the concept stage  in fact  is one of the major steps in a project life cycle  as it has the largest impact on cost and performance  17  in designing environmentally optimal buildings  the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project 
exterior light shelves - green office building  denver colorado
however  building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process  and varies from one building to the other  never repeating itself identically  in addition  buildings are much more complex products  composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage  a variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building s relevant life-cycle stages  18 
energy efficiency edit 
main articles  low-energy house and zero-energy building

green buildings often include measures to reduce energy consumption  both the embodied energy required to extract  process  transport and install building materials and operating energy to provide services such as heating and power for equipment 
as high-performance buildings use less operating energy  embodied energy has assumed much greater importance  and may make up as much as 30  of the overall life cycle energy consumption  studies such as the u s  lci database project 19  show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick  concrete  or steel  20 
to reduce operating energy use  designers use details that reduce air leakage through the building envelope  the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space   they also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls  ceilings  and floors  another strategy  passive solar building design  is often implemented in low-energy homes  designers orient windows and walls and place awnings  porches  and trees 21  to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter  in addition  effective window placement  daylighting  can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day  solar water heating further reduces energy costs 
onsite generation of renewable energy through solar power  wind power  hydro power  or biomass can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building  power generation is generally the most expensive feature to add to a building 
water efficiency edit 
see also  water conservation
reducing water consumption and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building  one critical issue of water consumption is that in many areas  the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself  to the maximum extent feasible  facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected  used  purified  and reused on-site  the protection and conservation of water throughout the life of a building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars  waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads  bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper  reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site  point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation  the use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer  22 
large commercial buildings with water and energy efficiency can qualify for an leed certification  philadelphia s comcast center is the tallest building in philadelphia  it s also one of the tallest buildings in the usa that is leed certified  their environmental engineering consists of a hybrid central chilled water system which cools floor-by-floor with steam instead of water  burn s mechanical set-up the entire renovation of the 58 story  1.4 million square foot sky scraper 
materials efficiency edit

building materials typically considered to be  green  include lumber from forests that have been certified to a third-party forest standard  rapidly renewable plant materials like bamboo and straw  dimension stone  recycled stone  recycled metal  see  copper sustainability and recyclability   and other products that are non-toxic  reusable  renewable  and or recyclable  for concrete a high performance or roman self-healing concrete is available  23  24  the epa  environmental protection agency  also suggests using recycled industrial goods  such as coal combustion products  foundry sand  and demolition debris in construction projects  25  energy efficient building materials and appliances are promoted in the united states through energy rebate programs 
indoor environmental quality enhancement edit 
see also  indoor air quality
the indoor environmental quality  ieq  category in leed standards  one of the five environmental categories  was created to provide comfort  well-being  and productivity of occupants  the leed ieq category addresses design and construction guidelines especially  indoor air quality  iaq   thermal quality  and lighting quality  26  27  28 
indoor air quality seeks to reduce volatile organic compounds  or vocs  and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants  buildings rely on a properly designed ventilation system  passively naturally or mechanically powered  to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated  filtered air as well as isolated operations  kitchens  dry cleaners  etc   from other occupancies  during the design and construction process choosing construction materials and interior finish products with zero or low voc emissions will improve iaq  most building materials and cleaning maintenance products emit gases  some of them toxic  such as many vocs including formaldehyde  these gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants  health  comfort  and productivity  avoiding these products will increase a building s ieq  leed  29  hqe 30  and green star contain specifications on use of low-emitting interior  draft leed 2012 31  is about to expand the scope of the involved products  breeam 32  limits formaldehyde emissions  no other vocs  mas certified green is a registered trademark to delineate low voc-emitting products in the marketplace  33  the mas certified green program ensures that any potentially hazardous chemicals released from manufactured products have been thoroughly tested and meet rigorous standards established by independent toxicologists to address recognized long term health concerns  these iaq standards have been adopted by and incorporated into the following programs   1  the united states green building council  usgbc  in their leed rating system 34   2  the california department of public health  cdph  in their section 01350 standards 35   3  the collaborative for high performance schools  chps  in their best practices manual 36  and  4  the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association  bifma  in their level sustainability standard  37 
also important to indoor air quality is the control of moisture accumulation  dampness  leading to mold growth and the presence of bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns  water intrusion through a building s envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building s interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth  a well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes  cooking  bathing  cleaning  and other activities 
personal temperature and airflow control over the hvac system coupled with a properly designed building envelope will also aid in increasing a building s thermal quality  creating a high performance luminous environment through the careful integration of daylight and electrical light sources will improve on the lighting quality and energy performance of a structure  22  38 
solid wood products  particularly flooring  are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates  wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet  the asthma and allergy foundation of american recommends hardwood  vinyl  linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet  39  the use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity  40 
interactions among all the indoor components and the occupants together form the processes that determine the indoor air quality  extensive investigation of such processes is the subject of indoor air scientific research and is well documented in the journal indoor air  41 
operations and maintenance optimization edit 
no matter how sustainable a building may have been in its design and construction  it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly  ensuring operations and maintenance o m  personnel are part of the project s planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed at the onset of the project  42  every aspect of green building is integrated into the o m phase of a building s life  the addition of new green technologies also falls on the o m staff  although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design  construction and demolition phases of a building s life-cycle  it is in the o m phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place  o m staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency  resource conservation  ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices  education of building operators and occupants is key to effective implementation of sustainable strategies in o m services  43 
waste reduction edit 
green architecture also seeks to reduce waste of energy  water and materials used during construction  for example  in california nearly 60  of the state s waste comes from commercial buildings 44  during the construction phase  one goal should be to reduce the amount of material going to landfills  well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well  by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going to landfills 
to reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill  neutral alliance  a coalition of government  ngos and the forest industry  created the website dontwastewood com  the site includes a variety of resources for regulators  municipalities  developers  contractors  owner operators and individuals homeowners looking for information on wood recycling 
when buildings reach the end of their useful life  they are typically demolished and hauled to landfills  deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered  waste  and reclaiming it into useful building material  45  extending the useful life of a structure also reduces waste  building materials such as wood that are light and easy to work with make renovations easier  46 
to reduce the impact on wells or water treatment plants  several options exist   greywater   wastewater from sources such as dishwashing or washing machines  can be used for subsurface irrigation  or if treated  for non-potable purposes  e g   to flush toilets and wash cars  rainwater collectors are used for similar purposes 
centralized wastewater treatment systems can be costly and use a lot of energy  an alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer  which avoids these costs and shows other benefits  by collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste  liquid fertilizer can be produced  this concept was demonstrated by a settlement in lubeck germany in the late 1990s  practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  offsetting greenhouse gas emission  producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process  47 
cost and payoff edit 
the most criticized issue about constructing environmentally friendly buildings is the price  photo-voltaics  new appliances  and modern technologies tend to cost more money  most green buildings cost a premium of  2   but yield 10 times as much over the entire life of the building  48  in regards to the financial benefits of green building  over 20 years  the financial payback typically exceeds the additional cost of greening by a factor of 4-6 times  and broader benefits  such as reductions in greenhouse gases  ghgs  and other pollutants have large positive impacts on surrounding communities and on the planet  49  the stigma is between the knowledge of up-front cost 50  vs  life-cycle cost  the savings in money come from more efficient use of utilities which result in decreased energy bills  it is projected that different sectors could save  130 billion on energy bills  51  also  higher worker or student productivity can be factored into savings and cost deductions 
numerous studies have shown the measurable benefit of green building initiatives on worker productivity  in general it has been found that   there is a direct correlation between increased productivity and employees who love being in their work space  52  specifically  worker productivity can be significantly impacted by certain aspects of green building design such as improved lighting  reduction of pollutants  advanced ventilation systems and the use of non-toxic building materials  53  in the business case for green building  the u s  green building council gives another specific example of how commercial energy retrofits increase worker health and thus productivity  people in the u s  spend about 90  of their time indoors  epa studies indicate indoor levels of pollutants may be up to ten times higher than outdoor levels  leed-certified buildings are designed to have healthier  cleaner indoor environmental quality  which means health benefits for occupants   54 
studies have shown over a 20-year life period  some green buildings have yielded  53 to  71 per square foot back on investment  55  confirming the rentability of green building investments  further studies of the commercial real estate market have found that leed and energy star certified buildings achieve significantly higher rents  sale prices and occupancy rates as well as lower capitalization rates potentially reflecting lower investment risk  56  57  58 
regulation and operation edit 
as a result of the increased interest in green building concepts and practices  a number of organizations have developed standards  codes and rating systems that let government regulators  building professionals and consumers embrace green building with confidence  in some cases  codes are written so local governments can adopt them as bylaws to reduce the local environmental impact of buildings 
green building rating systems such as breeam  united kingdom   leed  united states and canada   dgnb  germany   casbee  japan   and verdegbce  spain  help consumers determine a structures level of environmental performance  they award credits for optional building features that support green design in categories such as location and maintenance of building site  conservation of water  energy  and building materials  and occupant comfort and health  the number of credits generally determines the level of achievement  59 
green building codes and standards  such as the international code councils draft international green construction code  60  are sets of rules created by standards development organizations that establish minimum requirements for elements of green building such as materials or heating and cooling 
some of the major building environmental assessment tools currently in use include 
united states  international green construction code  igcc 
international frameworks and assessment tools edit

fidic s psm
the international federation of consulting engineers  fidic  project sustainability management guidelines were created in order to assist project engineers and other stakeholders in setting sustainable development goals for their projects that are recognized and accepted by as being in the interests of society as a whole  the process is also intended to allow the alignment of project goals with local conditions and priorities and to assist those involved in managing projects to measure and verify their progress 
the project sustainability management guidelines are structured with themes and sub-themes under the three main sustainability headings of social  environmental and economic  for each individual sub-theme a core project indicator is defined along with guidance as to the relevance of that issue in the context of an individual project 
the sustainability reporting framework provides guidance for organizations to use as the basis for disclosure about their sustainability performance  and also provides stakeholders a universally applicable  comparable framework in which to understand disclosed information 
the reporting framework contains the core product of the sustainability reporting guidelines  as well as protocols and sector supplements  the guidelines are used as the basis for all reporting  they are the foundation upon which all other reporting guidance is based  and outline core content for reporting that is broadly relevant to all organizations regardless of size  sector  or location  the guidelines contain principles and guidance as well as standard disclosures  including indicators  to outline a disclosure framework that organizations can voluntarily  exibly  and incrementally  adopt 
protocols underpin each indicator in the guidelines and include definitions for key terms in the indicator  compilation methodologies  intended scope of the indicator  and other technical references 
sector supplements respond to the limits of a one-size-ts-all approach  sector supplements complement the use of the core guidelines by capturing the unique set of sustainability issues faced by different sectors such as mining  automotive  banking  public agencies and others 
ipd environment code
the ipd environment code 62  was launched in february 2008  the code is intended as a good practice global standard for measuring the environmental performance of corporate buildings  its aim is to accurately measure and manage the environmental impacts of corporate buildings and enable property executives to generate high quality  comparable performance information about their buildings anywhere in the world  the code covers a wide range of building types  from ofces to airports  and aims to inform and support the following 
creating an environmental strategy
inputting to real estate strategy
communicating a commitment to environmental improvement
creating performance targets
environmental improvement plans
performance assessment and measurement
life cycle assessments
acquisition and disposal of buildings
supplier management
