bard offshore 1 s location in the wind farms of the german bight
bard offshore 1 is a 400 megawatt  mw  north sea offshore wind farm with 80 bard 5.0 turbines  construction was finished in july 2013 1  and the wind farm was officially inaugurated in august 2013  2  the wind farm is located 100 kilometres  62mi  northwest of the isle borkum in 40 metres  130ft  deep water  3 
laying of cables to connect the wind farm started on 23 july 2009  4  the 200km connection is the longest of its kind in the world  it is also the first connection of an offshore wind park realized as hvdc-transmission  construction of the wind turbines began in march 2010  5  the first turbine became operational at the beginning of december 2010  construction was assisted by the purpose-built wind lift1 barge   platform  which placed the 470ton  21 meter foundations on the sea bed 
the project has run into serious and unclear problems  including being three years behind schedule and  at a cost of 3 billion  run significantly over budget  a diver 6  and a worker died during construction  7  8  the farm was supposed to go online in august 2013  but a series of setbacks  including a fire at a transmission station in march 2014  have delayed its activation  9  bard went bankrupt in november 2013  10  problems include overvoltage and harmonics 11  between bard and the borwin 1 grid link and borwin alpha hvdc converter platform  12 
bard s original owner had decided to make all components within the company  and troubles from the custom transformer are unrelated to standard equipment used elsewhere  13 
as of january 2015 update   most of the turbines are not supplying power to shore  costing ratepayers 2million per day  14 
in september 2015  statkraft and ocean breeze extended their contract for two years  15 
by may 2016  the company website stated that the wind farm had produced 3 twh  and was running stable at full capacity  16
