shinjuku is surrounded by chiyoda to the east  bunkyo and toshima to the north  nakano to the west  and shibuya and minato to the south  3 
the current city of shinjuku grew out of several separate towns and villages  which have retained some distinctions despite growing together as part of the tokyo metropolis 
east shinjuku  the area east of shinjuku station and surrounding shinjuku-sanchome station  historically known as naito-shinjuku  houses the city hall and the flagship isetan department store  as well as several smaller areas of interest 
kabukich  tokyo s best-known red-light district  renowned for its variety of bars  restaurants  and sex-related establishments 
golden gai  an area of tiny shanty-style bars and clubs  musicians  artists  journalists  actors and directors gather here  and the ramshackle walls of the bars are literally plastered with film posters 
shinjuku gyoen  a large park  58.3 hectares  3.5km in circumference  blending japanese traditional  english landscape and french formal style gardens 
shinjuku ni-chme  tokyo s best-known gay district 
nishi-shinjuku  the area west of shinjuku station  historically known as yodobashi  is home to tokyo s largest concentration of skyscrapers  several of the tallest buildings in tokyo are located in this area  including the tokyo metropolitan government building  kddi building and park tower 
ochiai  the northwestern corner of shinjuku  extending to the area around ochiai-minami-nagasaki station and the south side of mejiro station  is largely residential with a small business district around nakai station

naturally  most of shinjuku is occupied by the yodobashi plateau  the most elevated portion of which extends through most of the shinjuku station area  the kanda river runs through the ochiai and totsuka areas near sea level  but the toshima plateau also builds elevation in the northern extremities of totsuka and ochiai  the highest point in shinjuku is hakone-san in toyama park  44.6 m above sea level  5 
history edit 
shinjuku at night
street level in shinjuku
in 1634  during the edo period  as the outer moat of the edo castle was built  a number of temples and shrines moved to the yotsuya area on the western edge of shinjuku  in 1698  nait-shinjuku had developed as a new  shin  station  shuku or juku  on the ksh kaid  one of the major highways of that era  nait was the family name of a daimyo whose mansion stood in the area  his land is now a public park  the shinjuku gyoen 
in 1920  the town of nait-shinjuku  which comprised large parts of present-day shinjuku  the neighbourhood  not the municipality   parts of nishi-shinjuku and kabukich was integrated into tokyo city  shinjuku began to develop into its current form after the great kant earthquake in 1923  since the seismically stable area largely escaped the devastation  consequently  west shinjuku is one of the few areas in tokyo with many skyscrapers 
the tokyo air raids from may to august 1945 destroyed almost 90  of the buildings in the area in and around shinjuku station  6  the pre-war form of shinjuku  and the rest of tokyo  for that matter  was retained after the war because the roads and rails  damaged as they were  remained  and these formed the heart of the shinjuku in the post-war construction  only in kabuki-cho was a grand reconstruction plan put into action  7 
the present ward was established on march 15  1947 with the merger of the former wards of yotsuya  ushigome  and yodobashi  it served as part of the athletics 50km walk and marathon course during the 1964 summer olympics  8 
in 1991  the tokyo metropolitan government moved from the marunouchi district of chiyoda to the current building in shinjuku   the tokyo international forum stands on the former site vacated by the government
