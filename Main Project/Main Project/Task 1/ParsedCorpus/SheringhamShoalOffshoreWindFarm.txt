history edit 
in 2004 the crown estate awarded econventures  utrecht  nl  the lease of the round 2 wind farm site at sheringham shoal  1  econventures together with slp energy  lowestoft  uk  formed a joint venture scira offshore energy to develop a c  315mw wind farm  development work for econventures was to be carried out by evelop bv  both subsidiaries of econcern bv  2  in 2005 hydro took a 50  stake in scira  acquiring 25  shareholdings from both slp energy and ecocentures  3 
in 2006 scira submitted a planning application to the department of trade and industry for a 108 turbine  315 mw wind farm  4 
the planned wind farm was approximately 18 kilometres  11mi  off the coast of norfolk at sheringham  just within the 12nm uk territorial water boundary  and 5 kilometres  3.1mi  north of the sand bank known as sheringham shoal  the wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 metres  52 to 72ft  and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines  benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities  lack of any dredging  dumping  oil gas  or mod practice areas  and of cables or pipelines  as well as low visual impact from the coast  and outside any nature conservation areas  5  the seabed at the windfarm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly gravely sand  overlying chalk  6  the electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near muckleburgh collection  via landfall near weybourne hope  7  two routes were considered for the export cable  one avoiding the sand bank atsheringham shoal  8  the connection to the national grid was planned to be made at an electrical substation near salle  norfolk via a 132kv 21.3 kilometres  13.2mi  underground cable  9 
planning consent for the wind farm was given on 8 august 2008  10 
in 2009 statkraft acquired 50  of the shareholding in scira becoming joint  50 50  owners of the development  11  in 2014 the green investment bank took a 240 million 20  stake in the wind farm  12 
the lease on the sea bed given by the crown estate has a duration of 50 years  and the  initial  wind farm has an estimated lifespan of 20 years  the 2004 energy act requires the developer to decommission the wind farm once out of use - the decommissioning plan submitted by the developer included  removal of wind turbines  cutting of foundations at seabed level or lower  whilst interarray cables would be left on the sea bed  13 
construction edit 
turbine installation vessel gms endeavour  30 september 2011 
in april 2008 nexans was awarded a 24m contract for the supply and construction of the 145kv export cables  14  and was awarded a 12m   15.8m  contract in april 2009 to supply 81km of 36kv inter-array cables  15  areva obtained a 50 million contract to supply offshore and onshore substations in late 2008  16  17  design and project management of the offshore substations was sub-contracted to wood group  18 
design work on the turbine and substation foundations was contracted to ramboll  19  the two foundations for the substations and foundations for 88 turbines were supplied by mt hjgaard  20  manufacture of the turbine monopiles and transition pieces was subcontracted to sif group and smulders  21  the substation superstructure and foundations were subcontracted to heerema  topside   bladt industries  transition pieces  and sif group and smulders  piles   22  in 2009 siemens obtained a 450 million contract to supply 88 wind turbines to the wind farm  23 
onshore work began in 2009  24  and construction of the offshore part began march 2010  25  26  turbine foundations installation begain in june 2010  27  mt hjgaard installed the substation piles and 17 of the turbine foundations  using the vessel svanen  halting installation due to a previously scheduled contract for the installation vessel  20  the foundations installed by mt hjgaard used a special method  the support of the foundation on the delivery barge had its motion steadied by a 135t sliding support with hydraulic motors compensating for wave oscillations  28  29  delays of several months of the arrival of foundation transport vessels  coupled with wave conditions limiting the operational window of use of the transport vessels  meant that the vessel svanen was not able to install all the foundations  the delay had an estimated additional cost of 600million nok  citation needed 
export cable installation began late 2010  under contract to visser   smith marine contracting  work was carried out by the ships atlantic guardian  route clearance   team oman  laying   and vos sympathy  trenching   30 
the offshore substations were installed in may 2011 by heerema  31  the remaining pile foundations  and the transition pieces and offshore substation topsides where installed by seaway heavy lifting between may and aug 2011 using the newly built oleg strashnov  32  33  a previous contract with master marine for the substation installation was cancelled and transferred to seaway due to the delays  34  foundation and transition piece installation was complete by aug 2011  32  35 
inter-array cables were laid by team oman  and installed under the sea bed by water jetting by toisa warrior  installation was complete by mar 2012  36  37 
the turbine installation was contracted to gulf marine services in dec 2010  the initial contract with master marine was terminated by mutual agreement after the foundation installation delays  38  turbine installation was carried out by the jackup vessels sea jackand gms endeavour  with sea jack replaced by sea jack leviathan in late 2011  36  39  the first turbine was installed on 3 july 2011  40  and began generating in aug 2011  41  installation was complete by july 2012  42 
operations bases edit 
as part of the development the harbour and channel at wells harbour was dredged to allow wind farm maintenance vessels to be based there  a 150 metres  490ft  pontoon jetty was also built  the work was completed early 2010  43  44  45  an onshore operations base was constructed at egmere  3 miles south of wells-next-the-sea  with building work taking place in 2012  46  47  48 
operation edit 
the wind farm was operational by late 2011  49  an official opening took place on september 27  2012 attended by norway s crown prince haakon and uk secretary of state edward davey  50  51  the cost of development has been estimated at 10billion norwegian krona   1.8 billion   52  wells harbour is used as the operational base for the wind farm  52 
in june 2013 a consortium   blue transmission   macquarie capital group  barclays infrastructure funds  acquired the electrical transmission assets of the wind farm for 193 million  53  in aug 2013 statkraft took over operations and maintenance of the windfarm from scira  54  statoil takes over operation from statkraft  beginning in 2017  while also increasing its share in the proposed dogger bank wind farm  55 
by sep 2013 the wind farm had generated 1.2twh in its first year of operation  56
