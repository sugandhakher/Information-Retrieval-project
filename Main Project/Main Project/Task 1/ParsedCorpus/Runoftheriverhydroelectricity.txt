run-of-the-river hydroelectricity  ror  is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided  run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage  in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as pondage  a plant without pondage has no water storage and is  therefore  subject to seasonal river flows  thus  the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source while a plant with pondage can regulate the water flow at all times and can serve as a peaking power plant or base load power plant

concept edit 
run-of-the-river or ror hydroelectricity is considered ideal for streams or rivers that can sustain a minimum flow or those regulated by a lake or reservoir upstream  1  2  a small dam is usually built to create a headpond ensuring that there is enough water entering the penstock pipes that lead to the turbines which are at a lower elevation  3  projects with pondage  as opposed to those without pondage  can store water for daily load demands  1  in general  projects divert some or most of a river s flow  up to 95  of mean annual discharge  4  through a pipe and or tunnel leading to electricity-generating turbines  then return the water back to the river downstream  3 
ror projects are dramatically different in design and appearance from conventional hydroelectric projects  traditional hydro dams store enormous quantities of water in reservoirs  sometimes flooding large tracts of land  in contrast  run-of-river projects do not have most of the disadvantages associated with dams and reservoirs  which is why they are often considered environmentally friendly  5  in canada no large hydroelectric reservoir has been created since the 1980s 
the use of the term  run-of-the-river  for power projects varies around the world  some may consider a project ror if power is produced with no water storage while limited storage is considered ror by others  developers may mislabel a project ror to soothe public perception about its environmental or social effects  the bureau of indian standards describes run-of-the-river hydroelectricity as  6 
a power station utilizing the run of the river flows for generation of power with sufficient pondage for supplying water for meeting diurnal or weekly fluctuations of demand  in such stations  the normal course of the river is not materially altered  6 
many of the larger ror projects have been designed to a scale and generating capacity rivaling some traditional hydro dams  7  for example  the beauharnois hydroelectric generating station in quebec is rated at 1,853 mw 8  and a 2006 proposal in british columbia  canada has been designed to generate 1027 megawatts capacity  9  some run of the river projects are downstream of other dams and reservoirs  the run of the river project didn t build the reservoir  but does take advantage of the water supplied by it  an example would be the 1995  1,436 mw la grande-1 generating station  previous upstream dams and reservoirs are part of the 1980s james bay project 
advantages edit 
when developed with care to footprint size and location  ror hydro projects can create sustainable energy minimizing impacts to the surrounding environment and nearby communities  3  advantages include 
cleaner power  fewer greenhouse gases edit 
like all hydro-electric power  run-of-the-river hydro harnesses the natural potential energy of water  eliminating the need to burn coal or natural gas to generate the electricity needed by consumers and industry 
less flooding reservoirs edit 
substantial flooding of the upper part of the river is not required for run-of-river projects as a large reservoir is not required  as a result  people living at or near the river don t need to be relocated and natural habitats and productive farmlands are not wiped out 
disadvantages edit 
 unfirm  power edit 
run-of-the-river power is considered an  unfirm  source of power  a run-of-the-river project has little or no capacity for energy storage 10  and hence can t co-ordinate the output of electricity generation to match consumer demand  it thus generates much more power during times when seasonal river flows are high  i e   spring freshet   9  and depending on location  much less during drier summer months or frozen winter months 
availability of sites edit 
the potential power at a site is a result of the head and flow of water  by damming a river  the head is available to generate power at the face of the dam  where a dam may create a reservoir hundreds of kilometers long  in run of the river the head is usually delivered by a canal  pipe or tunnel constructed upstream of the power house  due to the cost of upstream construction  a steep drop in the river is desirable 
environmental impacts edit 
small  well-sited ror projects can be developed with minimal environmental impacts  3  larger projects have more environmental concerns  for example  plutonic power corp  s canceled bute inlet hydroelectric project in bc would have seen three clusters of run-of-river projects with 17 river diversions  7  as proposed  this run-of-river project would divert over 90 kilometres of streams and rivers into tunnels and pipelines  requiring 443km of new transmission line  267km of permanent roads  and 142 bridges to be built in wilderness areas  11 
british columbia s mountainous terrain and wealth of big rivers have made it a global testing ground for run-of-river technology  as of march 2010  there were 628 applications pending for new water licences solely for the purposes of power generation  representing more than 750 potential points of river diversion  12 
concerns edit 
diverting large amounts of river water reduces river flows  affecting water velocity and depth  minimizing habitat quality for fish and aquatic organisms  reduced flows can lead to excessively warm water for salmon and other fish in summer  3 
new access roads and transmission lines can cause extensive habitat fragmentation for many species  allowing the introduction of invasive species and increases in undesirable human activities  like illegal hunting  3 
the lack of reservoir storage may result in intermittent operation  reducing the project s viability
