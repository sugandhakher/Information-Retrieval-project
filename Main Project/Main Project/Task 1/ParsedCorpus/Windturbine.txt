a wind turbine is a device that converts the wind s kinetic energy into electrical power 
wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types  the smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs  slightly larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid  arrays of large turbines  known as wind farms  are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels

main article  history of wind power
james blyth s electricity-generating wind turbine  photographed in 1891
windmills were used in persia  present-day iran  about 500-900 a d  1  the windwheel of hero of alexandria marks one of the first known instances of wind powering a machine in history  2  3  however  the first known practical windmills were built in sistan  an eastern province of iran  from the 7th century  these  panemone  were vertical axle windmills  which had long vertical drive shafts with rectangular blades  4  made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material  these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water  and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries  5 
windmills first appeared in europe during the middle ages  the first historical records of their use in england date to the 11th or 12th centuries and there are reports of german crusaders taking their windmill-making skills to syria around 1190  6  by the 14th century  dutch windmills were in use to drain areas of the rhine delta  advanced wind mills were described by croatian inventor fausto veranzio  in his book machinae novae  1595  he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or v-shaped blades 
the first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in july 1887 by scottish academic james blyth to light his holiday home in marykirk  scotland  7  some months later american inventor charles f  brush was able to build the first automatically operated wind turbine after consulting local university professors and colleagues jacob s  gibbs and brinsley coleberd and successfully getting the blueprints peer-reviewed for electricity production in cleveland  ohio  7  although blyth s turbine was considered uneconomical in the united kingdom 7  electricity generation by wind turbines was more cost effective in countries with widely scattered populations  6 
the first automatically operated wind turbine  built in cleveland in 1887 by charles f  brush  it was 60 feet  18m  tall  weighed 4 tons  3.6 metric tonnes  and powered a 12kw generator  8 
in denmark by 1900  there were about 2500 windmills for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills  producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 mw  the largest machines were on 24-meter  79ft  towers with four-bladed 23-meter  75ft  diameter rotors  by 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators operating in the united states from 5kw to 25kw  around the time of world war i  american windmill makers were producing 100,000 farm windmills each year  mostly for water-pumping  9 
by the 1930s  wind generators for electricity were common on farms  mostly in the united states where distribution systems had not yet been installed  in this period  high-tensile steel was cheap  and the generators were placed atop prefabricated open steel lattice towers 
a forerunner of modern horizontal-axis wind generators was in service at yalta  ussr in 1931  this was a 100kw generator on a 30-meter  98ft  tower  connected to the local 6.3kv distribution system  it was reported to have an annual capacity factor of 32 percent  not much different from current wind machines  10 
in the autumn of 1941  the first megawatt-class wind turbine was synchronized to a utility grid in vermont  the smith-putnam wind turbine only ran for 1,100 hours before suffering a critical failure  the unit was not repaired  because of shortage of materials during the war 
the first utility grid-connected wind turbine to operate in the uk was built by john brown   company in 1951 in the orkney islands  7  11 
despite these diverse developments  developments in fossil fuel systems almost entirely eliminated any wind turbine systems larger than supermicro size  in the early 1970s  however  anti-nuclear protests in denmark spurred artisan mechanics to develop microturbines of 22kw  organizing owners into associations and co-operatives lead to the lobbying of the government and utilities and provided incentives for larger turbines throughout the 1980s and later  local activists in germany  nascent turbine manufacturers in spain  and large investors in the united states in the early 1990s then lobbied for policies that stimulated the industry in those countries  later companies formed in india and china  as of 2012  danish company vestas is the world s biggest wind-turbine manufacturer

a quantitative measure of the wind energy available at any location is called the wind power density  wpd   it is a calculation of the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine  and is tabulated for different heights above ground  calculation of wind power density includes the effect of wind velocity and air density  color-coded maps are prepared for a particular area described  for example  as  mean annual power density at 50 metres   in the united states  the results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as  nrel class   the larger the wpd  the higher it is rated by class  classes range from class 1  200 watts per square meter or less at 50m altitude  to class 7  800 to 2000 watts per square m   commercial wind farms generally are sited in class 3 or higher areas  although isolated points in an otherwise class 1 area may be practical to exploit  12

efficiency edit 
not all the energy of blowing wind can be used  but some small wind turbines are designed to work at low wind speeds  14 
conservation of mass requires that the amount of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal  accordingly  betz s law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16/27  59.3   of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine  15 
the maximum theoretical power output of a wind machine is thus 0.59 times the kinetic energy of the air passing through the effective disk area of the machine  if the effective area of the disk is a  and the wind velocity v  the maximum theoretical power output p is

as wind is free  no fuel cost   wind-to-rotor efficiency  including rotor blade friction and drag  is one of many aspects impacting the final price of wind power  16  further inefficiencies  such as gearbox losses  generator and converter losses  reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine  to protect components from undue wear  extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed  further reducing theoretical efficiency  in 2001  commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75  to 80  of the betz limit of power extractable from the wind  at rated operating speed  17  18  needs update 
efficiency can decrease slightly over time due to wear  analysis of 3128 wind turbines older than 10 years in denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease  while the other half saw a production decrease of 1.2  per year  19  vertical turbine designs have much lower efficiency than standard horizontal designs  20 
types edit 
the three primary types  vawt savonius  hawt towered  vawt darrieus as they appear in operation
wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis  the former being both older and more common  21  they can also include blades  transparent or not  22  or be bladeless  23  vertical designs produce less power and are less common  24 
horizontal axis edit 
components of a horizontal axis wind turbine  gearbox  rotor shaft and brake assembly  being lifted into position
a turbine blade convoy passing through edenfield  uk
horizontal-axis wind turbines  hawt  have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower  and must be pointed into the wind  small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane  while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servo motor  most have a gearbox  which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator  25 
since a tower produces turbulence behind it  the turbine is usually positioned upwind of its supporting tower  turbine blades are made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds  additionally  the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted forward into the wind a small amount 
downwind machines have been built  despite the problem of turbulence  mast wake   because they don t need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind  and because in high winds the blades can be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance  since cyclical  that is repetitive  turbulence may lead to fatigue failures  most hawts are of upwind design 
turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed and pointed into the wind by computer-controlled motors  these have high tip speeds of over 320km h  200mph   high efficiency  and low torque ripple  which contribute to good reliability  the blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from 20 to 40 meters  66 to 131ft  or more  the tubular steel towers range from 60 to 90 meters  200 to 300ft  tall 
the blades rotate at 10 to 22 revolutions per minute  at 22 rotations per minute the tip speed exceeds 90 meters per second  300ft s   26  27  a gear box is commonly used for stepping up the speed of the generator  although designs may also use direct drive of an annular generator  some models operate at constant speed  but more energy can be collected by variable-speed turbines which use a solid-state power converter to interface to the transmission system  all turbines are equipped with protective features to avoid damage at high wind speeds  by feathering the blades into the wind which ceases their rotation  supplemented by brakes 
year by year the size and height of turbines increase  offshore wind turbines are built up to 8mw today and have a blade length up to 80m  onshore wind turbines are installed in low wind speed areas and getting higher and higher towers  usual towers of multi megawatt turbines have a height of 70m to 120m and in extremes up to 160m  with blade tip speeds reaching 80m s to 90m s  higher tip speeds means more noise and blade erosion 
vertical axis edit 
a vertical axis twisted savonius type turbine 
vertical-axis wind turbines  or vawts  have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically  one advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective  which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable  it is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable  also  the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground  using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox  improving accessibility for maintenance  however  these designs produce much less energy averaged over time  which is a major drawback  24  28 
the key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train  the inherently lower power coefficient  the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade  the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train  and the difficulty of modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype  29 
when a turbine is mounted on a rooftop the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine  if the height of a rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50  of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence  wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites  30  31  noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress 
subtypes of the vertical axis design include 
offshore horizontal axis wind turbines  hawts  at scroby sands wind farm  uk
onshore horizontal axis wind turbines in zhangjiakou  china
darrieus wind turbine
 eggbeater  turbines  or darrieus turbines  were named after the french inventor  georges darrieus  32  they have good efficiency  but produce large torque ripple and cyclical stress on the tower  which contributes to poor reliability  they also generally require some external power source  or an additional savonius rotor to start turning  because the starting torque is very low  the torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades which results in greater solidity of the rotor  solidity is measured by blade area divided by the rotor area  newer darrieus type turbines are not held up by guy-wires but have an external superstructure connected to the top bearing  33 
giromill
a subtype of darrieus turbine with straight  as opposed to curved  blades  the cycloturbine variety has variable pitch to reduce the torque pulsation and is self-starting  34  the advantages of variable pitch are  high starting torque  a wide  relatively flat torque curve  a higher coefficient of performance  more efficient operation in turbulent winds  and a lower blade speed ratio which lowers blade bending stresses  straight  v  or curved blades may be used  35 
savonius wind turbine
these are drag-type devices with two  or more  scoops that are used in anemometers  flettner vents  commonly seen on bus and van roofs   and in some high-reliability low-efficiency power turbines  they are always self-starting if there are at least three scoops 
twisted savonius
twisted savonius is a modified savonius  with long helical scoops to provide smooth torque  this is often used as a rooftop windturbine and has even been adapted for ships  36 
another type of vertical axis is the parallel turbine  which is similar to the crossflow fan or centrifugal fan  it uses the ground effect  vertical axis turbines of this type have been tried for many years  a unit producing 10kw was built by israeli wind pioneer bruce brill in the 1980s  37  unreliable source  
vortexis
the most recent advancement in vertical axis wind turbines has been the vortexis vawt  utilizing a pre-swirled augmented vertical axis wind turbine  pa-vawt  designed for the purpose of developing a high efficiency vawt concept that keeps the advantages of vawt s compact size  lack of bias as to incoming wind direction  easy deployment and low radar cross section for use in mobile applications for the military  referred to in special operations as  black swan   38  39

wind turbines are designed to exploit the wind energy that exists at a location  aerodynamic modeling is used to determine the optimum tower height  control systems  number of blades and blade shape 
wind turbines convert wind energy to electricity for distribution  conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components 
the rotor component  which is approximately 20  of the wind turbine cost  includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy 
the generator component  which is approximately 34  of the wind turbine cost  includes the electrical generator  40  41  the control electronics  and most likely a gearbox  e g  planetary gearbox   42  adjustable-speed drive or continuously variable transmission 43  component for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity 
the structural support component  which is approximately 15  of the wind turbine cost  includes the tower and rotor yaw mechanism  44 
a 1.5 mw wind turbine of a type frequently seen in the united states has a tower 80 meters  260ft  high  the rotor assembly  blades and hub  weighs 22,000 kilograms  48,000lb   the nacelle  which contains the generator component  weighs 52,000 kilograms  115,000lb   the concrete base for the tower is constructed using 26,000 kilograms  58,000lb  of reinforcing steel and contains 190 cubic meters  250cuyd  of concrete  the base is 15 meters  50ft  in diameter and 2.4 meters  8ft  thick near the center  45 
among all renewable energy systems wind turbines have the highest effective intensity of power-harvesting surface 46  because turbine blades not only harvest wind power  but also concentrate it  47  dubious  discuss

a ram air turbine  rat  is a special kind of small turbine that is fitted to some aircraft  when deployed  the rat is spun by the airstream going past the aircraft and can provide power for the most essential systems if there is a loss of all on-board electrical power  49  as in the case of the  gimli glider  
the two-bladed turbine scd 6mw offshore turbine designed by aerodyn energiesysteme  built by mingyang wind power has a helideck for helicopters on top of its nacelle  the prototype was erected in 2014 in rudong china 
turbine monitoring and diagnostics edit 
see also  wind turbine prognostics
due to data transmission problems  structural health monitoring of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages attached to the nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipments  currently  digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades  these methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects  dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry  50  three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines  51 
materials and durability edit 
materials that are typically used for the rotor blades in wind turbines are composites  as they tend to have a high stiffness  high strength  high fatigue resistance  and low weight  52  typical resins used for these composites include polyester and epoxy  while glass and carbon fibers have been used for the reinforcing material  53  construction may use manual layup techniques or composite resin injection molding  as the price of glass fibers is only about one tenth the price of carbon fiber  glass fiber is still dominant  one of the predominant ways wind turbines have gain performance is by increasing rotor diameters  and thus blade length  longer blades place more demands on the strength and stiffness of the materials  stiffness is especially important to avoid having blades flex to the degree that they hit the tower of the wind turbine  carbon fiber is between 4 and 6 times stiffer than glass fiber  54  so carbon fiber is becoming more common in wind turbine blades  55 
materials for wind turbine parts other than the rotor blades  including the rotor hub  gearbox  frame  and tower  are largely composed of steel  smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components in an effort to make the turbines more lightweight and efficient  and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved  prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower  but still requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine  additionally  step-up gear boxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators  increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines  52  in particular this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium  reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as china has been main producer of rare earth minerals  96  in 2009  and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials  56  in recent years  however  other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and china has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals  increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale  57 
wind turbines on public display edit

the nordex n50 wind turbine and visitor centre of lamma winds in hong kong  china
a few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display  either with visitor centers around their bases  or with viewing areas farther away  58  the wind turbines are generally of conventional horizontal-axis  three-bladed design  and generate power to feed electrical grids  but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration  public relations  and education 
small wind turbines edit 
main article  small wind turbine
a small quietrevolution qr5 gorlov type vertical axis wind turbine in bristol  england  measuring 3m in diameter and 5m high  it has a nameplate rating of 6.5kw to the grid 
small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences  telecom towers  offshore platforms  rural schools and clinics  remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid  or where the grid is unstable  small wind turbines may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use  hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage  particularly in rural locations  as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point  59  the u s  department of energy s national renewable energy laboratory  nrel  defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts  60  small units often have direct drive generators  direct current output  aeroelastic blades  lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind 
larger  more costly turbines generally have geared power trains  alternating current output  flaps and are actively pointed into the wind  direct drive generators and aeroelastic blades for large wind turbines are being researched 
wind turbine spacing edit 
on most horizontal windturbine farms  a spacing of about 6-10 times the rotor diameter is often upheld  however  for large wind farms distances of about 15 rotor diameters should be more economically optimal  taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs  this conclusion has been reached by research 61  conducted by charles meneveau of the johns hopkins university  62  and johan meyers of leuven university in belgium  based on computer simulations 63  that take into account the detailed interactions among wind turbines  wakes  as well as with the entire turbulent atmospheric boundary layer  moreover  recent research by john dabiri of caltech suggests that vertical wind turbines may be placed much more closely together so long as an alternating pattern of rotation is created allowing blades of neighbouring turbines to move in the same direction as they approach one another  64 
operability edit 
maintenance edit 
wind turbines need regular maintenance to stay reliable and available  reaching 98   65  66 
modern turbines usually have a small onboard crane for hoisting maintenance tools and minor components  however  large heavy components like generator  gearbox  blades and so on are rarely replaced and a heavy lift external crane is needed in those cases  if the turbine has a difficult access road  a containerized crane can be lifted up by the internal crane to provide heavier lifting  67 
repowering edit 
main article  repowering
installation of new wind turbines can be controversial  an alternative is repowering  where existing wind turbines are replaced with bigger  more powerful ones  sometimes in smaller numbers while keeping or increasing capacity 
demolition edit 
older turbines were in some early cases not required to be removed when reaching the end of their life  some still stand  waiting to be recycled or repowered  68  69 
a demolition industry develops to recycle offshore turbines at a cost of dkk 24 million per mw  to be guaranteed by the owner  70
