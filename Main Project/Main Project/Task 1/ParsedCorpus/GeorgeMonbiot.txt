play media
monbiot in conversation with silver donald cameron about his work
after graduating in zoology  monbiot joined the bbc natural history unit as a radio producer  making natural history and environmental programmes  he transferred to the bbc s world service  where he worked briefly as a current affairs producer and presenter  before leaving to research and write his first book  9 
working as an investigative journalist  he travelled in indonesia  brazil  and east africa  his activities led to his being made persona non grata in seven countries 10  and being sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia in indonesia  11  in these places  he was also shot at  12  beaten up by military police  12  shipwrecked 12  and stung into a poisoned coma by hornets  13  he came back to work in britain after being pronounced clinically dead in lodwar general hospital in north-western kenya  having contracted cerebral malaria  14 
in britain  he joined the roads protest movement and was often called to give press interviews  as a result he was denounced as a  media tart  15  by groups such as green anarchist and class war  he was attacked by security guards  who allegedly drove a metal spike through his foot  smashing the middle metatarsal bone  his injuries left him in hospital  sir crispin tickell  a former british diplomat at the united nations  who was then warden at green college  oxford  made the young protester a visiting fellow  16  he was an active member of the pure genius   campaign and co-founded the land is ours  which has occupied land at several locations in britain  its first high-profile success was in 1997  when it occupied thirteen acres  five hectares  of prime real estate on the river in london on which its owner  beverages multinational diageo  intended to build a superstore  the protesters defeated diageo in court  built an  eco-village   and held on to the land for six months  17 
among his best-known articles are his critique of david bellamy s climate science  18  his description of an encounter with a police torturer in brazil  19  his attack on libertarian interpretations of genetics  20  his discussion of the ethics of outsourcing  21  and his attack on the politics of bob geldof and bono  22 
in january 2011  monbiot took the unusual step of publishing an account of his assets  23  in the interests of transparency  monbiot explained that he earned 77,400 a year  gross  from publishing contracts and rents  and urged other journalists to follow suit  he continues to publish his financial accounts on his website  24 
he has held visiting fellowships or professorships at the universities of oxford  environmental policy   bristol  philosophy   keele  politics   oxford brookes  planning   and east london  environmental science   citation needed 
monbiot lived in oxford for many years  but in 2007 moved with his then-wife  writer and campaigner angharad penrhyn jones  and daughter to a low emissions house in the mid-wales market town of machynlleth  25  monbiot s second daughter was born in the spring of 2012  26  because his new partner lives in oxford  monbiot had returned there by 2013  27 
in november 2012  he apologised to lord mcalpine for his  stupidity and thoughtlessness  in implying  in a tweet  that the tory peer was a paedophile  28  29  30  in march 2013  monbiot announced on his blog the details of a settlement reached with lord mcalpine s representatives  monbiot agreed  to carry out  over the next three years  work on behalf of three charities of my choice whose value amounts to 25,000   which he described as an  unprecedented settlement   31 
activism edit 
climate change edit 
monbiot believes that drastic action coupled with strong political will is needed to combat global warming  32  monbiot has written that climate change is the  moral question of the 21st century  and that there is an urgent need for a number of emergency actions he believes will stop climate change  including  setting targets on greenhouse emissions using the latest science  issuing every citizen with a  personal carbon ration   new building regulations with houses built to german passivhaus standards  banning incandescent light bulbs  patio heaters  garden floodlights  and other inefficient technologies and wasteful applications  constructing large offshore wind farms  replacing the national gas grid with a hydrogen pipe network  a new national coach network to make journeys using public transport faster than using a car  all petrol stations to supply leasable electric car batteries with stations equipped with a crane service to replace depleted batteries  scrap road-building and road-widening programmes  redirecting their budgets to tackle climate change  reduce uk airport capacity by 90 percent  closing down all out-of-town superstores and replacing them with warehouses and a delivery system  33 
monbiot says the campaign against climate change is  unlike almost all the public protests  that came before it   it is a campaign not for abundance but for austerity  it is a campaign not for more freedom but for less  strangest of all  it is a campaign not just against other people  but against ourselves   34 
monbiot also thinks that economic recession can be a good thing for the planet   is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land  and should seek to stay there  why would we want to leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse  surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible   35  36  while he does recognize that recession can cause hardship  he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well  for example  the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth  but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution  36 
monbiot purchased a used diesel renault clio after moving to machynlleth in 2007  37  he has travelled through canada and the united states  campaigning on climate change and promoting his book  he contends that this travel was justifiable as it sought to boost the case for much greater carbon cuts there  38  39 
he is the patron of the uk student campaign network people   planet 40  and appears in the film the age of stupid in animated form  in which he says  the very fact that the crisis is taking place within our generation  it s happening right now  means that we are tremendously powerful people  so this position of despair and  i can t do anything  and  there s no point  is completely illogical  it s exactly the opposite   41  42 
monbiot attended the 2009 united nations climate change conference held in copenhagen 
monbiot once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry  43  he finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in march 2011  although he  still loathe s  the liars who run the nuclear industry   44  monbiot now advocates its use  having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the 2011 japan tsunami on nuclear reactors in the region  44  subsequently  he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement  writing that it  has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health   made  claims  ungrounded in science  unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong   he singled out helen caldicott for  he wrote  making unsourced and inaccurate claims  dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up  and overstating the death toll from the chernobyl disaster by a factor of more than 140  45  in october 2013 monbiot criticized the selection of a generation iii reactor design for the hinkley point c nuclear power station due to cost as well as for a half century requirement of uranium mining and transuranic waste production  he contrasted this with two generation iv reactor concepts   if integral fast reactors were deployed  the uk s stockpile of nuclear waste could be used to generate enough low-carbon energy to meet all uk demand for 500 years  these reactors would keep recycling the waste until hardly any remained  solving three huge problemsenergy supply  nuclear waste and climate changeat once  thorium reactors use an element that s already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted byproduct of other mining industries  they recycle their own waste  leaving almost nothing behind   46   cf  similar comments by james hansen 
in 2012  monbiot claimed that there was more than enough oil for  industry and consumer capitalism  to  deep-fry the lot of us   citing a report of 110 million barrels per day in 2020  47  48 
debate with ian plimer edit 
monbiot harshly criticised the book heaven and earth by climate change skeptic ian plimer  saying that  since its publication in australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors  and its fudging and manipulation of the data   49  plimer challenged monbiot to a public debate on the issues covered in the book  monbiot agreed on the condition that plimer first answer a series of written questions for publication on the website of the guardian  so there would be a factual basis to the discussion  50  plimer refused and monbiot labeled plimer a  grandstander  with a  broad yellow streak  who has nowhere answered the accusations of serious errors in his heaven and earth book  and accused him of trying to  drown out the precise refutations published by his book s reviewers   51  plimer then reversed his decision  and agreed to answer written questions in return for a live debate  52  monbiot s response on receiving plimer s contribution was one of disappointment  on the grounds that plimer s response  so far consists not of answers  but of questions addressed to me   53  monbiot told plimer that he is not qualified to answer plimer s questions 53   although gavin schmidt of nasa did answer them   54  on 2 september 2009  monbiot published another column in the guardian asking   is ian plimer ever going to answer my questions   and suggested that plimer was evading the questions by using the chewbacca defence  55  a debate was subsequently held on 15 december  while monbiot was in copenhagen  on the australian broadcasting corporation s lateline programme  moderated by tony jones  56  57 
attempted arrest of john bolton edit 
monbiot made an unsuccessful attempt to carry out a citizen s arrest of john bolton  a former u s  ambassador to the united nations  when the latter attended the hay festival to give a talk on international relations in may 2008  monbiot argued that bolton was one of the instigators of the iraq war  of which monbiot was an opponent  58 
political parties edit 
he was involved initially with the respect political party  but he broke with the organisation when it chose to run candidates against the green party in the 2004 election to the european parliament  59  in an interview with the british political blog third estate in september 2009  monbiot expressed his support for the policies of plaid cymru  saying  i have finally found the party that i feel very comfortable with  thats not to say i feel uncomfortable with the green party  on the whole i support it  but i feel even more comfortable with plaid   60 
in april 2010  he was a signatory to an open letter of support for the liberal democrats  published in the guardian  61  prior to the 2015 uk general election  he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the green party s caroline lucas  62 
indigenous rights edit 
monbiot has been associated with the cause of indigenous rights  and has sought to denounce threats to tribal people  at the face of corporate interests  63  64  he contributed to the 2009 book we are one  a celebration of tribal peoples  65  which explores the culture of peoples around the world  portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces 
published works edit 
monbiot s first book was poisoned arrows  1989   a work of investigative travel journalism exposing what he called the  devastating effects  of the partially world bank-funded transmigration program on the peoples and tribes of papua and west papua in indonesia  it was followed by amazon watershed  1991  which documented expulsions of brazilian peasant farmers from their land and followed them thousands of miles across the forest to the territory of the yanomami indians  and showed how timber sold in britain was being stolen from indigenous and biological reserves in brazil  his third book  no man s land  an investigative journey through kenya and tanzania  1994   documented the seizure of land and cattle from nomadic people in kenya and the tanzania  byamong other forcesgame parks and safari tourism 
in 2000  he published captive state  the corporate takeover of britain  the book examines the role of corporate power in the united kingdom  on both local and national levels  and argues that corporate involvement in politics is a serious threat to democracy  subjects discussed in the book include the building of the skye bridge  corporate involvement in the national health service  the role of business in university research  and the conditions which influence the granting of planning permission 
monbiot at a make poverty history rally in scotland
the age of consent edit 
his fifth book  the age of consent  a manifesto for a new world order  was published in 2003  the book is an attempt to set out a positive manifesto for change for the global justice movement  monbiot criticises anarchism and marxism  arguing that any possible solution to the world s inequalities must be rooted in a democratic parliamentary system  the four main changes to global governance which monbiot argues for are a democratically elected world parliament which would pass resolutions on international issues  a democratised united nations general assembly to replace the unelected un security council  the proposed international clearing union which would automatically discharge trade deficits and prevent the accumulation of debt  and a fair trade organisation which would regulate world trade in a way that protects the economies of poorer countries  66 
the book also discusses ways in which these ideas may be put into practice  he posits that the united states and western european states are heavily dependent on the existence of this debt  and that when faced with a choice between releasing the developing world from debt and the collapse of the global economy  their internal economic interests will dictate that they opt for the  soft landing  option  however  monbiot emphasises that he does not present the manifesto as a  final or definitive  answer to global inequalities but intends that it should open debate and stresses that those who reject it must offer their own solutions  he argues that ultimately the global justice movement  must seek   to provide a coherent programme of alternatives to the concentrated power of the dictatorship of vested interests  
heat edit 
monbiot s next book  heat  how to stop the planet burning  published in 2006  focuses on the issue of climate change  he points out that the public opinion campaign to cast doubt on the reality of climate change is funded by fossil-fuel companies  primarily exxon-mobil   and traces the  network of fake citizens  groups and bogus scientific bodies  campaigning to discredit climate science to origins in a campaign by tobacco companies to create a facade of science to cast doubt on the link between cigarette smoking and disease  67  he argues that a 90 percent reduction in carbon emissions is necessary in developed countries in order to prevent disastrous changes to the climate  he then sets out to demonstrate how such a reduction could be achieved within the united kingdom  without a significant fall in living standards  through changes in housing  power supply  and transport 
feral edit 
feral  searching for enchantment on the frontiers of rewilding was published in 2013  and focuses on the concept of rewilding the planet  monbiot states  rewilding offers a positive environmentalism  environmentalists have long known what they are against  now we can explain what we are for   68 
in the book  monbiot attacks sheep farming as  a slow-burning ecological disaster  which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution  yet scarcely anyone seems to have noticed   69  he particularly looks at sheep farming in wales 
the book received favourable reviews  including in publications normally hostile to his work  such as the spectator 70  and the daily telegraph  69  it won the society of biology book award for general biology in 2014  71
