history edit 
this section needs expansion  you can help by adding to it   november 2013 
in november 1776  methane was first scientifically identified by italian physicist alessandro volta in the marshes of lake maggiore straddling italy and switzerland  volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by benjamin franklin about  flammable air   7  volta captured the gas rising from the marsh  and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas  8  he also demonstrated means to ignite the gas with an electric spark  8 
the name  methane  was coined in 1866 by the german chemist august wilhelm von hofmann  9 
properties and bonding edit 
methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent ch bonds  its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals  mos  resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on c and h  the lowest energy mo is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms  above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of mos that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen  the resulting  three-over-one  bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements 
at room temperature and standard pressure  methane is a colorless  odorless gas  10  the familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an odorant  usually blends containing tert-butylthiol  as a safety measure  methane has a boiling point of 161 c  257.8 f  at a pressure of one atmosphere  11  as a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations  5.417   in air at standard pressure 
solid methane exists in several modifications  presently nine are known  12  cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane i  this substance crystallizes in the cubic system  space group fm3m   the positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane i  i e  methane molecules may rotate freely  therefore  it is a plastic crystal  13 
chemical reactions edit 
the primary chemical reactions of methane are combustion  steam reforming to syngas  and halogenation  in general  methane reactions are difficult to control  partial oxidation to methanol  for example  is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen  the enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane  but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions  14 
acid-base reactions edit 
like other hydrocarbons  methane is a very weak acid  its pka in dmso is estimated to be 56  15  it cannot be deprotonated in solution  but the conjugate base with methyllithium is known 
a variety of positive ions derived from methane have been observed  mostly as unstable species in low-pressure gas mixtures  these include methenium or methyl cation ch 
3  methane cation ch 
4  and methanium or protonated methane ch 
5  some of these have been detected in outer space  methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with superacids  cations with higher charge  such as ch2 
6 and ch3 
7  have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable  16 
despite the strength of its ch bonds  there is intense interest in catalysts that facilitate ch bond activation in methane  and other lower numbered alkanes   17 
combustion edit 
methane s heat of combustion is 55.5 mj kg  18  combustion of methane is a multiple step reaction  the following equations are part of the process  with the net result being

the species m  signifies an energetic third body  from which energy is transferred during a molecular collision  formaldehyde  hcho or h
2co  is an early intermediate  reaction 7   oxidation of formaldehyde gives the formyl radical  hco  reactions 810   which then give carbon monoxide  co   reactions 11  12   13   any resulting h2 oxidizes to h2o or other intermediates  reaction 14  15   finally  the co oxidizes  forming co2  reaction 16   in the final stages  reactions 1719   energy is transferred back to other third bodies  the overall speed of reaction is a function of the concentration of the various entities during the combustion process  the higher the temperature  the greater the concentration of radical species and the more rapid the combustion process  19 
reactions with halogens edit 
given appropriate conditions  methane reacts with halogens as follows 
x2   uv  2 x
x   ch4  hx   ch3
ch3   x2  ch3x   x
where x is a halogen  fluorine  f   chlorine  cl   bromine  br   or iodine  i   this mechanism for this process is called free radical halogenation  it is initiated with uv light or some other radical initiator  a chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine  which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane  resulting in the formation of hydrogen chloride  the resulting methyl radical  ch3  can combine with another chlorine molecule to give methyl chloride  ch3cl  and a chlorine atom  this chlorine atom can then react with another methane  or methyl chloride  molecule  repeating the chlorination cycle  20  similar reactions can produce dichloromethane  ch2cl2   chloroform  chcl3   and  ultimately  carbon tetrachloride  ccl4   depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio 
uses edit 
methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid  liquefied natural gas  or lng   while leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas  the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air  gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas  of which methane is the principal component 
fuel edit 
methane is used as a fuel for ovens  homes  water heaters  kilns  automobiles  21  22  turbines  and other things  it combusts with oxygen to create fire 
natural gas edit 
main article  natural gas
methane is important for electrical generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator  compared to other hydrocarbon fuels  methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released  at about 891 kj mol  methane s heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but the ratio of the heat of combustion  891 kj mol  to the molecular mass  16.0 g mol  of which 12.0 g mol is carbon  shows that methane  being the simplest hydrocarbon  produces more heat per mass unit  55.7 kj g  than other complex hydrocarbons  in many cities  methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking  in this context it is usually known as natural gas  which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter  or 1,000 btu per standard cubic foot 
methane in the form of compressed natural gas is used as a vehicle fuel and is claimed to be more environmentally friendly than other fossil fuels such as gasoline petrol and diesel  22  research into adsorption methods of methane storage for use as an automotive fuel has been conducted  23 
liquefied natural gas edit 
main article  liquefied natural gas
liquefied natural gas  lng  is natural gas  predominantly methane  ch4  that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport 
liquefied natural gas takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state  it is odorless  colorless  non-toxic and non-corrosive  hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state  freezing  and asphyxia 
the liquefaction process involves removal of certain components  such as dust  acid gases  helium  water  and heavy hydrocarbons  which could cause difficulty downstream  the natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure  maximum transport pressure set at around 25kpa or 3.6psi  by cooling it to approximately 162c  260f   citation needed 
lng achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas  cng  so that the energy density of lng is 2.4times greater than that of cng or 60  that of diesel fuel  24  this makes lng cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist  specially designed cryogenic sea vessels  lng carriers  or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport 
lng  when it is not highly refined for special uses  is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets  where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas  it is also beginning to be used in lng-fueled road vehicles  for example  trucks in commercial operation have been achieving payback periods of approximately four years on the higher initial investment required in lng equipment on the trucks and lng infrastructure to support fueling  25  however  it remains more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas  as of 2002 update   the relatively higher cost of lng production and the need to store lng in more expensive cryogenic tanks had slowed widespread commercial use  26 
liquid methane rocket fuel edit 
in a highly refined form  liquid methane is used as a rocket fuel  27 
though methane has been investigated for decades  no production methane engines have yet been used on orbital spaceflights  28  this promises to change as liquid methane has recently been selected for the active development of a variety of bipropellant rocket engines 
since the 1990s  a number of russian rockets using liquid methane have been proposed  29  30  one 1990s russian engine proposal was the rd-192  a methane lox variant of the rd-191  30 
in 2005  us companies  orbitech and xcor aerospace  developed a demonstration liquid oxygen liquid methane rocket engine and a larger 7,500 pounds-force  33kn -thrust engine in 2007 for potential use as the cev lunar return engine  before the cev program was later cancelled  31  32  33 
more recently the american private space company spacex announced in 2012 an initiative to develop liquid methane rocket engines  34  including initially  the very large raptor rocket engine  35  raptor is being designed to produce 4.4 meganewtons  1,000,000lbf  of thrust with a vacuum specific impulse  isp  of 363 seconds and a sea-level isp of 321 seconds  36  and began component-level testing in 2014  37  in february 2014  the raptor engine design was shown to be of the highly efficient and theoretically more reliable full-flow staged combustion cycle type  where both propellant streamsoxidizer and fuelare completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber  prior to 2014  only two full-flow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands  but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle  36  in 2016  a development raptor engine was tested  38 
in october 2013  the china aerospace science and technology corporation  a state-owned contractor for the chinese space program  announced that it had completed a first ignition test on a new lox methane rocket engine  no engine size was provided  39 
in september 2014  another american private space companyblue origin publicly announced that they were into their third year of development work on a large methane rocket engine  the new engine  the blue engine 4  or be-4  has been designed to produce 2,400 kilonewtons  550,000lbf  of thrust  while initially planned to be used exclusively on a blue origin proprietary launch vehicle  it will now be used on a new united launch alliance  ula  engine on an new launch vehicle that is a successor to the atlas v  ula indicated in 2014 that they will make the maiden flight of the new launch vehicle no earlier than 2019  40 
one advantage of methane is that it is abundant in many parts of the solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body  in particular  using methane production from local materials found on mars 41  or titan   providing fuel for a return journey  27  42 
by 2013  nasa s project morpheus had developed a small restartable lox methane rocket engine with 5,000 pounds-force  22kn  thrust and a specific impulse of 321 seconds suitable for inspace applications including landers  small lox methane thrusters 515 pounds-force  2267n  were also developed suitable for use in a reaction control system  rcs   43  44 
spacenews is reporting in early 2015 that the french space agency cnes is working with germany and a few other governments and will propose a lox methane engine on a reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015  needs update  with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026  45 
chemical feedstock edit 
although there is great interest in converting methane into useful or more easily liquefied compounds  the only practical processes are relatively unselective  in the chemical industry  methane is converted to synthesis gas  a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen  by steam reforming  this endergonic process  requiring energy  utilizes nickel catalysts and requires high temperatures  around 7001100c 
ch4   h2o  co   3 h2
related chemistries are exploited in the haber-bosch synthesis of ammonia from air  which is reduced with natural gas to a mixture of carbon dioxide  water  and ammonia 
methane is also subjected to free-radical chlorination in the production of chloromethanes  although methanol is a more typical precursor  46 
in recent years  there have been reports of further commercially viable processes leveraging methane as a chemical feedstock  e g   based on the oxidative coupling of methane  the catalytic oxidation of methane into methanol 47  and the direct reaction of methane with sulfur trioxide  48  49  despite significant research efforts  incl  venture capital financing   efforts continue to focus on pilot and demo plant-level  as of 2016  only the startup of an industrial scale production plant for methanesulfonic acid via direct reaction of methane with sulfur trioxide has been communicated for 2019  49 
production edit 
biological routes edit 
main article  methanogenesis
naturally occurring methane is mainly produced by the process of methanogenesis  this multistep process is used by microorganisms as an energy source  the net reaction is 
co2   8 h    8 e  ch4   2 h2o
the final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme coenzyme-b sulfoethylthiotransferase  methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by organisms that occupy landfill  ruminants  e g   cattle   and the guts of termites 
it is uncertain if plants are a source of methane emissions  50  51  52 
power to gas edit 
main article  power to gas
power to gas is a technology which converts electrical power to a gas fuel  the method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane   see natural gas  using electrolysis and the sabatier reaction  clarification needed  excess and off-peak power generated by wind generators and solar arrays could theoretically be used for load balancing in the energy grid  citation needed 
industrial routes edit 
methane can be produced by hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the sabatier process  methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the fischer-tropsch process  this technology is practiced on a large scale to produce longer chain molecules than methane 
natural gas is so abundant that the intentional production of methane is relatively rare  the only large scale facility of this kind is the great plains synfuels plant  started in 1984 in beulah  north dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low grade lignite  a resource which is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight  ash content  low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport 
laboratory synthesis edit 
methane can also be produced by the destructive distillation of acetic acid in the presence of soda lime or similar  acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process  methane can also be prepared by reaction of aluminium carbide with water or strong acids  it is also made by reducing a solution of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid with iron powder  giving water and ferrous chloride as a byproduct 
on mars edit 
methane has been proposed as a possible rocket propellant on future mars missions due in part to the possibility of synthesizing it on the planet via in situ resource utilization  53 
an adaptation of the sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars  utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere  41 
methane could also be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization a  involving water  carbon dioxide  and the mineral olivine  which is known to be common on mars  54 
occurrence edit 
methane was discovered and isolated by alessandro volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from lake maggiore  it is the major component of natural gas  about 87  by volume  the major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields  with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source  see coal bed methane extraction  a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit  while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams   it is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels  and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen  methane is produced at shallow levels  low pressure  by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the earth s surface  in general  the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil 
methane is generally transported in bulk by pipeline in its natural gas form  or lng carriers in its liquefied form  few countries transport it by truck 
alternative sources edit 
testing australian sheep for exhaled methane production  2001   csiro
apart from gas fields  an alternative method of obtaining methane is via biogas generated by the fermentation of organic matter including manure  wastewater sludge  municipal solid waste  including landfills   or any other biodegradable feedstock  under anaerobic conditions  rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth  methane hydrates clathrates  ice-like combinations of methane and water on the sea floor  found in vast quantities  are a potential future source of methane  cattle belch methane accounts for 16  of the world s annual methane emissions to the atmosphere  55  one study reported that the livestock sector in general  primarily cattle  chickens  and pigs  produces 37  of all human-induced methane  56  early research has found a number of medical treatments and dietary adjustments that help slightly limit the production of methane in ruminants  57  58  a 2009 study found that at a conservative estimate  at least 51  of global greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the life cycle and supply chain of livestock products  meaning all meat  dairy  and by-products  and their transportation  59  more recently  a 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44 percent of human-induced methane and 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions  60  many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production and trap the gas to use as energy  61 
paleoclimatology research published in current biology suggests that flatulence from dinosaurs may have warmed the earth  62 
atmospheric methane edit 
main article  atmospheric methane
methane concentrations up to december 2015  mauna loa 
methane is created near the earth s surface  primarily by microorganisms by the process of methanogenesis  it is carried into the stratosphere by rising air in the tropics  uncontrolled build-up of methane in the atmosphere is naturally checked although human influence can upset this natural regulation by methane s reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor  it has a net lifetime of about 10 years  63  and is primarily removed by conversion to carbon dioxide and water 
in addition  there is a large  but unknown  amount of methane in methane clathrates in the ocean floors as well as the earth s crust 
in 2010  methane levels in the arctic were measured at 1850 nmol mol  a level over twice as high as at any time in the 400,000 years prior to the industrial revolution  historically  methane concentrations in the world s atmosphere have ranged between 300 and 400 nmol mol during glacial periods commonly known as ice ages  and between 600 and 700 nmol mol during the warm interglacial periods  recent research suggests that the earth s oceans are a potentially important new source of arctic methane  64 
methane is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 compared to co2 over a 100-year period  and 72 over a 20-year period  65  66  67 
the earth s atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150  since 1750  and it accounts for 20  of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases  these gases don t include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect   6 
clathrates edit 
methane is essentially insoluble in water  but it can be trapped in ice forming a similar solid  significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of earth at large depths 
arctic methane release from permafrost and methane clathrates is an expected consequence and further cause of global warming  68  69  70 
anaerobic oxidation of methane edit 
there is a group of bacteria that drive methane oxidation with nitrite as the oxidant  the anaerobic oxidation of methane  71 
safety edit 
methane is nontoxic  yet it is extremely flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air  methane is violently reactive with oxidizers  halogen  and some halogen-containing compounds  methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space  asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16  by displacement  as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21  to 16  without ill effects  the concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 515  concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture  methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane  some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building 
methane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters  72  a methane gas explosion was the cause of the upper big branch coal mine disaster in west virginia on april 5  2010  killing 25  73 
extraterrestrial methane edit 
methane has been detected or is believed to exist on all planets of the solar system and most of the larger moons  with the possible exceptions of mars and titan  it is believed to have come from abiotic processes 
mercury  the tenuous atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane  74 
venus  the atmosphere contains a large amount of methane from 60km  37mi  to the surface according to data collected by the pioneer venus large probe neutral mass spectrometer 75 
moon  traces are outgassed from the surface 76 
methane  ch4  on mars  potential sources and sinks 
mars  the martian atmosphere contains 10 nmol mol methane  77  the source of methane on mars has not been determined  recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes  fault lines  or methanogens  78  that it may be a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms  79  or that it may be the result of uv radiation  80  in january 2009  nasa scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas  leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface  81  studies of a weather research and forecasting model for mars  marswrf  and related mars general circulation model  mgcm  suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers  which is within the roving capabilities of future mars rovers  82  the curiosity rover  which landed on mars in august 2012  can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane  83  but even if the mission determines that microscopic martian life is the source of the methane  it probably resides far below the surface  beyond the rover s reach  84  curiosity s sample analysis at mars  sam  instrument is capable of tracking the presence of methane over time to determine if it is constant  variable  seasonal  or random  providing further clues about its source  85  the first measurements with the tunable laser spectrometer  tls  indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site  86  87  88  89 
methane measurements in the atmosphere of mars by the curiosity rover
