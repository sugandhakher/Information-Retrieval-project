the london array is a 175 turbine 630mw round 2 offshore wind farm located 20km off the kent coast in the outer thames estuary in the united kingdom  it is the largest offshore wind farm in the world  and the largest wind farm in europe by megawatt capacity 
construction of phase 1 of the wind farm began in march 2011 and was completed by mid 2013  being formally inaugurated by the prime minister of the united kingdom  david cameron on 4 july 2013 
the second phase of the project was refused planning consent in 2014 due to concerns on the impact to sea birds

description edit 
the wind farm site is more than 20 kilometres  12mi  off the north foreland on the kent coast in the area between long sand and kentish knock  between margate in kent and clacton in essex  2  the site is mostly away from shipping lanes  3 
the first phase consisted of 175 siemens wind power swt-3.6 turbines and two offshore substations  giving a wind farm with a peak rated power of 630mw  4  each turbine and offshore substation is erected on a monopile foundation  and connected together by 210 kilometres  130mi  of 33kv array cables  the two offshore substations are connected to an onshore substation at cleve hill  near graveney  on the north kent coast  by four 150kv subsea export cables  in total 220 kilometres  140mi   4  it is named after london because the power goes to the london grid  5 
the smaller thanet wind farm is to the south of it 
the array is intended to reduce annual co2 emissions by about 900,000 tons  equal to the emissions of 300,000 passenger cars  6 
history edit 
in 2001 environmental studies identified areas of the outer thames estuary as potential sites for offshore wind farm  7  the department of trade and industry published the paper future offshore -a strategic framework for the offshore wind industry  which identified the outer thames estuary as one of three potential areas for future wind farm development  round 2 wind farms   8  the crown estate awarded a 50-year lease to london array ltd   a consortium of e on uk renewables  shell windenergy  and core limited  note 1   in december 2003  7  11  a planning application was submitted in 2005  11  12  which was approved in december 2006  13  planning permission for the onshore electricity substation was received in november 2007  10 
in may 2008  shell announced that it was pulling out of the project  14  it was announced in july 2008 that e on uk and dong energy would buy shell s stake  15  subsequently on 16 october 2008  london array announced the abu dhabi based masdar would join e on as a joint venture party in the scheme  under the agreement  masdar purchased 40  of e on s half share of the scheme  giving masdar a 20  stake in the project overall  16  17  the resultant ownership was 50  dong energy  30  e on uk renewables and 20  masdar  18 
in march 2009  the backers agreed on an initial investment of 2.2billion  19  financing of phase 1 was achieved through the european investment bank and the danish export credit fund with 250 million  18 
in 2013  in response to  offshore transmission owner  regulations  see ofgem   the consortium divested the electrical transmission assets of the wind farm  valued at 459 million  to  blue transmission london array limited   an entity incorporated by barclays infrastructure funds management limited  barclays  and diamond uk transmission corporation  mitsubishi corporation subsidiary   20

in january 2014 dong sold half its stake to quebec public pension plan manager caisse de dpt et placement du qubec   la caisse    21 
at the time of its construction it was the largest offshore wind farm in the world  22 
construction and commissioning edit 
offshore work began in march 2011  23  the first foundation was installed in march 2011 24 
turbines were supplied by siemens wind power  25  their foundations were built by the joint-venture between per aarsleff and bilfinger berger ingenieurbau gmbh  the same company supplied and installed the monopiles  26  generators were installed by mpi and a2sea by using an installation vessel tivmpi adventure and a jack-up barge sea worker  27  two offshore substations were designed  fabricated and installed by future energy  a joint venture between fabricom  iemants and geosea  while electrical systems and onshore substation work was undertaken by siemens transmission   distribution  the subsea export cable was supplied by nexans and array cables by jdr cable systems  the array cables and the export cables were installed by vsmc  26 
the wind farm started producing electricity at the end of october 2012  23  all 175 turbines of phase 1 were confirmed fully operational on 8 april 2013  28  and the wind farm was formally inaugurated by the prime minister david cameron on 4 july 2013  29  in december 2015 it produced 369 gwh  a monthly capacity factor of 78.9   it produced 2.5 twh in 2015  during two days of january 2016  production varied from 3 mw to 619 mw  30  31 
phase 2 edit 
a second phase was planned which would have seen a further 166 turbines installed to increase the capacity to 1000mw  32  however  the second phase was scaled back and finally cancelled in february 2014 after concerns were raised by the royal society for the protection of birds about its effect on a local population of red-throated divers  32  33
