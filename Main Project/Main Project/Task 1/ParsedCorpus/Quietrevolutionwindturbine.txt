quietrevolution turbine at the london olympic stadium
the quietrevolution is a discontinued brand of  vawt  vertical axis helical turbine  the helical design is most similar to the gorlov helical turbine  both are an evolution of the darrieus wind turbine  it has won several awards including the  sustainable innovation award  in 2006 
the turbine consists of three vertical airfoil blades  each having a helical twist of 120 degrees  this feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution  thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill  darrieus turbine   the wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine 
the qr5 turbine  rated for 6 kw  measures 3.0m in diameter by 5m high 
poor performance of a qr5 installed at welsh government offices in aberystwyth has been blamed on poor siting  1  the turbine s overall cost was given as 48,000 and in 2012 it generated an average of 33kwh per month  a value of 5.28 per month
