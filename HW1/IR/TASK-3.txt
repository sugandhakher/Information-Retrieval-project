TASK-3

The first Task had the strategy that	pages	in	a	shallower	depth	are	more important	than deeper	ones,	also,	within	each	individual	webpage, hyperlinks	appearing	earlier	on	in	the	webpage should	be	crawled	first.
And the second task was to depth and breadth crawl into the URL given.

So to merge the two approach would be to take a new seed URL : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power
and breadth search so that instead of going deeper into the link, we are keeping it shallower.
