sustainable forest management  sfm  is the
according to the principles of   sustainable forest management has to keep the balance between three main pillars    economic and socio-cultural  successfully achieving sustainable forest management will provide integrated benefits to all  ranging from safeguarding local livelihoods to protecting the biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests  reducing rural poverty and mitigating some of the effects of climate change 
the    adopted at
in rio de janeiro in 1992 captured the general international understanding of
forest management at that time  a number of sets of
have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of sfm at the global  regional  country and management unit level  these were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment of the degree to which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice  in 2007  the
adopted the   the instrument was the first of its kind  and reflected the strong international commitment to promote implementation of sustainable forest management through a new approach that brings all stakeholders together

definition  
a definition of sfm was developed by the
 forest europe   and has since been adopted by the
 fao   it defines sustainable forest management as 
the stewardship and use of
and forest lands in a way  and at a rate  that maintains their biodiversity  productivity  regeneration capacity  vitality and their potential to fulfill  now and in the future  relevant ecological  economic and social functions  at local  national  and global levels  and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems 
in simpler terms  the concept can be described as the attainment of balance  balance between society s increasing demands for forest products and benefits  and the preservation of forest health and diversity  this balance is critical to the survival of forests  and to the prosperity of forest-dependent communities 
for forest managers  sustainably managing a particular forest tract means determining  in a tangible way  how to use it today to ensure similar benefits  health and productivity in the future  forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors  commercial and non-commercial values  environmental considerations  community needs  even global impact  to produce sound forest plans  in most cases  forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens  businesses  organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed  the tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices 
in 2014  at the request of member states  the food and agriculture organization of the united nations developed and launched the   an online collection of tools  case studies and other resources to support countries implementing sustainable forest management 
because forests and societies are in constant flux  the desired outcome of sustainable forest management is not a fixed one  what constitutes a sustainably managed forest will change over time as values held by the public change

criteria and indicators are tools which can be used to conceptualise  evaluate and implement sustainable forest management  criteria define and characterize the essential elements  as well as a set of conditions or processes  by which sustainable forest management may be assessed  periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion 
criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management  there are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives  which collectively involve more than 150 countries  three of the more advanced initiatives are those of the working group on criteria and indicators for the conservation and sustainable management of temperate and boreal forests  also called the      and the   countries who are members of the same initiative usually agree to produce reports at the same time and using the same indicators  within countries  at the management unit level  efforts have also been directed at developing local level criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management  the   the
and researchers at the
have developed a number of tools and techniques to help forest-dependent communities develop their own local level criteria and indicators  criteria and indicators also form the basis of third-party forest certification programs such as the s
and the
standard 
there appears to be growing international consensus on the key elements of sustainable forest management  seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives  the seven thematic areas are 
extent of forest resources
and vitality
productive functions and forest resources
protective functions of forest resources
socio-economic functions
legal  policy and institutional framework 
this consensus on common thematic areas  or criteria  effectively provides a common  implicit definition of sustainable forest management  the seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the
and the 16th session of the committee on forestry  these thematic areas have since been enshrined in the
as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument 
on january 5  2012  the     the   and the   acknowledging the seven thematic areas  endorsed a
to improve global forest related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens 
ecosystem approach  
the
has been prominent on the agenda of the
 cbd  since 1995   the
definition of the ecosystem approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in
in 1995  known as the malawi principles  the definition  12 principles and 5 points of  operational guidance  were adopted by the fifth conference of parties  cop5  in 2000  the
definition is as follows
the ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land  water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way  application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the convention  an ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization  which encompasses the essential structures  processes  functions and interactions among organisms and their environment  it recognizes that humans  with their   are an integral component of many ecosystems 
sustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the
in 2004  decision vii 11 of cop7  to be a concrete means of applying the ecosystem approach to forest ecosystems  the two concepts  sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach  aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally  socially and economically sustainable  and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations  in europe  the mcpfe and the council for the pan-european biological and landscape diversity strategy  peblds  jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the ecosystem approach in 2006 
independent certification  
main article 
growing
and
for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest
emerge in the 1990s as a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations 
there are many potential users of certification  including  forest managers  scientists  policy makers  investors  environmental advocates  business consumers of wood and paper  and individuals 
with third-party   an independent organization develops standards of good forest management  and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards  forest certification verifies that forests are well-managedas defined by a particular standardand chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale 
this rise of certification led to the emergence of several different systems throughout the world  as a result  there is no single accepted forest management standard worldwide  and each system takes a somewhat different approach in defining standards for sustainable forest management 
in its 20092010 forest products annual market review united nations economic commission for europe food and agriculture organization stated   over the years  many of the issues that previously divided the  certification  systems have become much less distinct  the largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements   
third-party forest certification is an important tool for those seeking to ensure that the paper and wood products they purchase and use come from forests that are well-managed and legally harvested  incorporating third-party certification into forest product procurement practices can be a centerpiece for comprehensive wood and paper policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values  thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products 
the
of the
for certified sustainable forest product 
there are more than fifty certification standards worldwide  addressing the diversity of forest types and tenures  globally  the two largest umbrella certification programs are 
 pefc 
 fsc 
the area of forest certified worldwide is growing slowly  pefc is the world s largest forest certification system  with more than two-thirds of the total global certified area certified to its sustainability benchmarks 
in north america  there are three certification standards endorsed by pefc  the sustainable forestry initiative  the canadian standards associations sustainable forest management standard  and the american tree farm system  fsc has five standards in north america  one in the united states and four in canada 
while certification is intended as a tool to enhance forest management practices throughout the world  to date most certified forestry operations are located in europe and north america  a significant barrier for many forest managers in
is that they lack the capacity to undergo a certification audit and maintain operations to a certification standard

although a majority of forests continue to be owned formally by government  the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership  since neo-liberal ideology in the 1980s and the emanation of the climate change challenges  evidence that the state is failing to effectively manage environmental resources has emerged  under
regimes in the developing countries  the role of the state has diminished and the
have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role  though the critiques of neo-liberal policies have maintained that market forces are not only inappropriate for sustaining the environment  but are in fact a major cause of   hardins tragedy of the common  1968  has shown that the people cannot be left to do as they wish with land or   thus 
of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance 
the shifting of natural resource management responsibilities from central to state and local governments  where this is occurring  is usually a part of broader decentralization process  according to rondinelli and cheema  1983   there are four distinct decentralization options  these are   i  privatization  the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision   ii  delegation  centrally nominated local authority   iii 
 transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and  iv  deconcentration  the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government  the major key to effective decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making  in 2000  the world bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government  while at the same time  it is easier to hold local leaders accountable  from the study of west african tropical forest  it is argued that the downwardly accountable and or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency  development and equity  this collaborates with the world bank report in 2000 which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation  efficiency  accountability and equity by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely 
many reasons point to the advocacy of decentralization of forest   i  integrated rural development projects often fail because they are top-down projects that did not take local people s needs and desires into account   ii  national government sometimes have legal authority over vast forest areas that they cannot control  thus  many protected area projects result in increased biodiversity loss and greater social conflict  within the sphere of forest management  as state earlier  the most effective option of decentralization is devolution-the transfer of power to locally accountable authority  however  apprehension about local governments is not unfounded  they are often short of resources  may be staffed by people with low education and are sometimes captured by local elites who promote clientelist relation rather than democratic participation  enters and anderson  1999  point that the result of community-based projects intended to reverse the problems of past central approaches to conservation and development have also been discouraging 
broadly speaking  the goal of forest conservation has historically not been met when  in contrast with
changes  driven by demand for food  fuel and profit  it is necessary to recognize and advocate for better forest governance more strongly given the importance of forest in meeting basic
in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal  such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of
and greater governance role for local government  civil society  private sector and ngos on behalf of the communities 
national forest funds  
the development of national forest funds is one way to address the issue of financing sustainable forest management  national forest funds  nffs  are dedicated financing mechanisms managed by public institutions designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources  as of 2014  there are 70 nffs operating globally
