the natural environment encompasses all
and non-living things occurring   the term is most often applied to the
or some part of earth  this environment encompasses the interaction of all living species  climate  weather  and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity 
the concept of the natural environment can be distinguished by components 
complete
units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention  including all vegetation          and
that occur within their boundaries and their nature
universal
and
that lack clear-cut boundaries  such as air  water  and   as well as       and   not originating from civilized human activity
in contrast to the natural environment is the   in such areas where man has fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion  the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment  even acts which seem less extreme  such as building a mud
or a
in the   modify the natural environment into an artificial one  though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves  they are not human  hence
and the works of
are thought of as natural 
it is difficult to find absolutely natural environments on earth  and naturalness usually varies in a continuum  from 100  natural in one extreme to 0  natural in the other  more precisely  we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment  and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform  if  for instance  in an agricultural field  the
and the
of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil  but the structure is quite different 
natural environment is often used as a synonym for   for instance  when we say that the natural environment of giraffes is the

the earth s   or   is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying   it has been generated greatly by
processes in which

natural lakes on earth are generally found in
areas    and areas with ongoing or recent   other lakes are found in
or along the courses of mature rivers  in some parts of the world  there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last   all lakes are temporary over geologic time scales  as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them 
ponds

designed for aesthetic ornamentation 
designed for commercial fish breeding  and
designed to store thermal energy  ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via
speed  while currents in streams are easily observed  ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents  these features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features  such as

the
of the earth s atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of
 uv  radiation that reaches the surface  as
is readily damaged by uv light  this serves to protect life at the surface  the atmosphere also retains heat during the night  thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes 
atmospheric layers  
main article 
principal layers  
earth s atmosphere can be divided into five main layers  these layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude  from highest to lowest  these layers are 
  the outermost layer of earth s atmosphere extends from the exobase upward  mainly composed of
and  
  the top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere  called the   its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about 350800km  220500mi  1,150,0002,620,000ft   the
orbits in this layer  between 320 and 380km  200 and 240mi  
  the mesosphere extends from the stratopause to 8085km  5053mi  262,000279,000ft   it is the layer where most
burn up upon entering the atmosphere 
  the stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about 51km  32mi  167,000ft   the   which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere  typically is at 50 to 55km  31 to 34mi  164,000 to 180,000ft  
  the troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between 7km  23,000ft  at the poles and 17km  56,000ft  at the equator  with some variation due to weather  the troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface  so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude  the
is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere 
other layers
within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties 
the
is contained within the stratosphere  it is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 1535km  9.321.7mi  49,000115,000ft   though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically  about 90  of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere 
the   the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation  stretches from 50 to 1,000km  31 to 621mi  160,000 to 3,280,000ft  and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere  it forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere 
the
and   the homosphere includes the troposphere  stratosphere  and mesosphere  the upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen  the lightest element

a significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances  a common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist  methodologically  this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series  while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study

an example of the many

evidence suggests that
has existed for about 3.7
years  all known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms  and based on these observations  theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates  there are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple
via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism 
although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life  scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by         response to

a greater number or variety of species or
of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem  because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus  absorb  or reduce its effects  this reduces the effect before the ecosystem s structure is fundamentally changed to a different state  this is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level 
the term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments  such as
and human-influenced ecosystems  and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment  fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact  although some genuine
areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention

are considered important for the survival of certain   ecological studies    solitude  and   wilderness is deeply valued for cultural  spiritual    and
reasons  some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity

is from the
wildeornes  which in turn derives from wildeor meaning wild beast  wild   deor   beast  deer   from this point of view  it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness  the mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being  wilderness   many ecosystems that are  or have been  inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered  wild   this way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference

criticism  
in some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world  or their surroundings  specifically in the united states  many native cultures do not recognize the  environment   or see themselves as environmentalists
