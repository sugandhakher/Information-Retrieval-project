eco-labels and green stickers are labeling systems for food and consumer products  ecolabels are voluntary  but green stickers are mandated by law  for example  in north america major appliances and automobiles use   they are a form of
directed at consumers  intended to make it easy to take environmental concerns into account when shopping  some labels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of measurement  while others assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum requirements for
or reduction of harm to the environment  many ecolabels are focused on minimising the negative
of
or
in a given sector or commodity through a set of good practices that are captured in a sustainability standard  through a verification process  usually referred to as  certification   a farm  forest    orbel 
ecolabelling systems exist for both food and consumer products  both systems were started by   since then the
have developed
for conduct of ecolabelling and also have created their own ecolabels  one for food and one for consumer products  at least for food  the ecolabel is nearly identical with the common ngo definition of the rules for ecolabelling  label trust is an issue for consumers because as manufacturers and manufacturing associations have set up  rubber stamp  labels to
their products with fake ecolabels  high trust levels can be created when ecolabels apply for governmental recognition as formal certification marks  recognized by logos or names with  ctm   cm or  certtm    typically this means schemes approved as a certification mark  have had the government department responsible declare that the scheme has a standard and certifies that they are  competent to certify   the highest trust levels would be a government recognized certification mark that was also compliant with key iso standards especially iso 14024- type 1 ecolabels that undertake iso 14040 compliant life cycle analysis as part of their assessment

iso participation  
the last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space  there is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs  the international organization for standardization
has created standards for labeling practices within the
schema  iso 14020 to 14025 series deals with environmental labels and declarations  iso proposed three categories of environmental labels according to the aspects covered and the rigor required to award the seal  type i in iso 14024  type ii in iso 14021  and type iii in iso 14025  additionally  a different category called type i  like is present in the literature  which represents environmental labels focused on just one environmental or social aspect  these labels have been launched by independent organizations 
ecolabeling innovation cycle  
there is a close relationship between the ecolabeling process and the eco-innovation because it promotes the emergence of new green products and it improves the organizations environmental management strategy  moreover  ecolabeling process is a  cyclical eco-innovation process in which consumers  firms  governments and institutions interact  its final purpose is to contribute to the development of sustainable and ecological ways of production and consumption  in this process  consumers environmental expectations are met  firms increase their created and captured value and enhance their sustainability  and governments and institutions foster cleaner production and consumption  finally  this process is tangible in the products through the awarding of ecolabels  which are visibly displayed on goods and services  
environmental governance  
consumer desires for
is driving the global marketplace with desire to regulate product production  the globalization of economies is shifting control of sustainability away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument  ecolabelling 
the only ecolabel that takes into consideration legal and infrastructural limitations is
which is a startup in greece approved by the university of wales and which has the support of the dutch embassy and the orange grove  it is a certification programme with the intention to increase owner  staff  suppliers and stakeholders awareness with the intention to motivate them for an eco-friendly action towards a sustainable holiday and future for all of us in the long run and through which expenses can be minimized 
eco-labeling standardization is a new form of regulation which is voluntary in nature  but impose upon large companies market forces in order to harmonize production of goods and services with stronger ecological practices  recently  it has turned into a new form of non-state authority at both national and international levels  this idea of entrepreneurial democracy based on the success of the iso 14000 standards on the management of environmental quality and the iso 9000 standards on quality production control  once an industry sector decides to get this certification  it has to provide evidences of documented proof of compliance required  in terms of iso 14042 standard  it is obligatorily for all applicants to respect environmental legislation and related legislation  breaching of any laws may result in licensing suspension 
sustainable initiatives  
during the
conference in 1992  an international consensus was generated to integrate environmental issues into manufacturing procedures  the idea was to manipulate consumption patterns in order to achieve   the result of this is as follows 
currently in the   eco-labels and green stickers have evolved to play a vital role  they provide a verifiable link between products and
wishes  this approach applies market pressure on industries to minimize their environmental impact  this is evidenced by growth in population of   marketing strategists are responding with green certifications and its abuse   
currently in the   first consumers became concerned about the quality  safety and environmental sustainability of food and supported demand for green foods  then focused on the environmental effects of agriculture and globalization of food production  which led to the exposure of globally controlled food regimes  consumer advocate groups responded with a call for  alternative food networks   this gives a new dimension to consumer demands and corporate competitiveness  australian consumer association
confronted corporate interests with their concerns about growing interests in green consumption  food production  use of pesticides  organic production  and genetic modification  etc   
history  
green stickers on consumer goods have been evolving since the 1970s  the main drivers have been energy and fuel consumption  these stickers first started appearing on major appliances after government agencies in the united states and canada legislated their requirement  manufacturers are also required to meet minimum standards of energy use  the automobile industry in north america is required to meet a minimum emissions standard  this led to fuel efficiency labels being placed on new automobiles sold  the major appliance manufactures were required to use standard testing practices and place clear labels on products  the
has developed standards for addressing environmental labelling with the
family which grew out of iso s commitment to support the objective of sustainable development discussed at the united nations conference on environment and development  in rio de janeiro  in 1992
green labelling worldwide is moving beyond traditional country borders  most of these initiatives are voluntary eco-labels  however there is an initiative under way in north america to broaden the scope of green stickers to include other consumer goods 
programs by region  
governments of many countries have   these agencies are mandated watchdogs of industry and regulate releasing chemical pollution into the environment  some of them administer labelling standards  other set minimum requirements for manufacturers 
canada  
the office of energy efficiency  oee  run by the department of natural resources canada regulates both the automobile and appliance manufacturers  energuide label for vehicles found on all new passenger cars  light-duty vans  pickup trucks and special purpose vehicles not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of 3855kg  8500lb   the label shows the city and highway fuel consumption ratings and an estimated annual fuel cost for that particular vehicle  federal law in canada  under canada s energy efficiency regulations requires that the energuide label be placed on all new electrical appliances manufactured in or imported into canada and that the label indicate the amount of electricity used by that appliance  this information is determined by standardized test procedures  a third-party agency verifies that an appliance meets canada s minimum energy performance levels 
united states  
the energy star service mark is placed on energy-efficient products 
all major home appliances must meet the appliance standards program set by the us department of energy  doe  on cooperation with the us federal trade commission  manufacturers must use standard test procedures developed by doe to prove the energy use and efficiency of their products  test results are printed on yellow energyguide label  which manufacturers are required to display on many appliances  this label estimates how much energy the appliance uses  compares energy use of similar products  and lists approximate annual operating costs  appliances that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the u s  environmental protection agency are eligible for the blue
label  the energy star label is also available on energy-efficient televisions  computers  audio visual equipment and electronics  office equipment  heating and cooling equipment  and many more products  energy star is also available on energy efficient homes and buildings in the united states  american
manufacturers are required to use certified
test results and cannot use any other fuel mileage results to advertise vehicle fuel efficiency  the state of california has green sticker license plates issued to
is introducing green stickers for all new automobiles in 2009 
european union  
the
was established in 1992 by the european commission  the eu ecolabel helps to identify products and services that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle  recognised throughout europe  eu ecolabel is a voluntary label promoting environmental excellence which can be trusted  it is the only pan-european type i official ecolabel  the eu ecolabel is awarded according to ecological criteria agreed on by experts  industry 
and
and verified by independent third parties  the implementation of the eu ecolabel is set through the  
northern europe  
the
is the official ecolabel in nordic countries  it uses a system of standards  applications for licenses  and independent verification 
asean  
in asia
is moving towards adopting the iso s tc 207 environmental management system  anyone can contribute verifiable sources substantiating it s adoption and implementation by member countries as this information is not easily accessible 
australasia  
a number of ecolabels operate in australia and new zealand mostly as separate schemes operating in one country only  global greentag operates and is recognised in both countries as is geca whereas gecnz operates only within nz  all 3 ecolabels are iso 14024 compliant  greentag is also an australian competition and consumer commission  accc  approved certification mark 
seafood  
there are a plethora of sustainable seafood ecolabels  many conservationists feel that the increasing number of labels is further confusing consumers in regard to what seafood is sustainable  as of 2010  ecolabels that can be found on seafood include marine stewardship council  friend of the sea      thai quality shrimp  global aquaculture alliance s
standard  label rouge  france   among still others  and the aquaculture stewardship council  asc  is in development  seafood is also labeled  organic  but
standards for organic seafood are still in development 
there are a variety of   asserting that tuna is caught in a manner that does not harm

friend of the sea  
the
is an ngo founded in december 2006 to conserve marine habitat and resources by means of market incentives and specific conservation projects  it is the only scheme which certifies as sustainable  with the same seal of approval  both farmed and wild-caught products  certified products from all continents include anchovies  caviar  clams  cuttlefish  halibut  kingfish  mackerel  mulloway  mussels  prawns  salmon  seabass  seabream  shrimps  squid  sturgeon  trout  tuna  turbot  fishmeal  fishfeed and omega-3 fish oil have also been certified  sustainable seafood  products and their origins are audited onsite by international certification bodies  against friend of the sea criteria  certification bodies currently auditing against friend of the sea criteria are aqa  bureau veritas  ifqc and sgs  
sustainable timber  
ecolabel 
ecolabels indicating that timber in wood-based products originates from forests that are sustainably managed in compliance with internationally recognized standards include at a global level labels by the
and the   at regional and national levels labels by the
and the malaysian timber certification system  both internationally recognized by pefc  or the lembaga ekolabel indonesia  lei  
the timber is tracked through the supply chain to the end product  so that consumers can choose to buy sustainably harvested wood over alternatives that may be contributing to deforestation worldwide 
energy labels  
ecolabel for energy
main article 
many consumer appliances have labels indicating whether or not they are energy efficient compared to similar products  common labels include yellow energyguide tags found in north america as part of the
program    and the
logo administrated by the
in the united kingdom  these labels document how much energy an appliance consumes while being used 
documents how much energy was used to manufacture the product  an additional consideration in the full life cycle energy use of product 
are an alternative methodology for certification  examining impact on
emissions rather than direct energy use
