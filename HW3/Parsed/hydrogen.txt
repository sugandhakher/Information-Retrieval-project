the energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the

hydrides
main article 
compounds of hydrogen are often called   a term that is used fairly loosely  the term  hydride  suggests that the h atom has acquired a negative or anionic character  denoted h  and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more
element  the existence of the   suggested by
in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides  was demonstrated by moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten
 lih   producing a
quantity of hydrogen at the anode  for hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals  the term is quite misleading  considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen  an exception in group 2 hydrides is beh

although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements  the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely  for example  more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known  but only one binary aluminium hydride  binary
hydride has not yet been identified  although larger complexes exist

  hydrides  and
complexes  as well as in clustered  
protons and acids

oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives   which contains no electrons and a
which is usually composed of one proton  that is why h  is often called a proton  this species is central to discussion of   under the   acids are proton donors  while bases are proton acceptors 
a bare proton  h   cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons  except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas  such protons cannot be removed from the
of atoms and molecules  and will remain attached to them  however  the term  proton  is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or
hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion  and as such is denoted  h   without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species 
to avoid the implication of the naked  solvated proton  in solution  acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species  termed the   ion   h
3o    however  even in this case  such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to h

hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes  denoted 1h  2h and 3h  other  highly unstable nuclei  4h to 7h  have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature 
1h is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than 99.98   because the

hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today  during the early study of radioactivity  various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names  but such names are no longer used  except for deuterium and tritium  the symbols d and t  instead of 2h and 3h  are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium  but the corresponding symbol for protium  p  is already in use for

 inflammable air   he speculated that  inflammable air  was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called    and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned  he is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element  in 1783

the first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the british airship
in 1919  regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of
reserves in the united states promised increased safety  but the u s  government refused to sell the gas for this purpose  therefore  h2 was used in the
airship  which was destroyed in a midair fire over

one of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed  but not understood at the time  was a maxwell observation involving hydrogen  half a century before full
arrived  maxwell observed that the
of h2 unaccountably departs from that of a
gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures  according to quantum theory  this behavior arises from the spacing of the  quantized  rotational energy levels  which are particularly wide-spaced in h2 because of its low mass  these widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures  diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect

power plants using
or   a technology presently far from development  the sun s energy comes from
of hydrogen  but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on earth  elemental hydrogen from solar  biological  or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it  so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier  like a battery  hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources  such as methane   but these sources are unsustainable 
the
per unit volume of both
and
gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources  although the energy density per unit fuel mass is higher  nevertheless  elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy  as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy-wide scale  for example  co

could be conducted at the point of h
2 production from fossil fuels  hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly  with some
emissions  but without carbon emissions  however  the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial 
can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines 
semiconductor industry
hydrogen is employed to saturate broken   dangling   bonds of
and
that helps stabilizing material properties  it is also a potential
in various oxide materials  including                               and  
biological reactions

h2 is a product of some types of
and is produced by several   usually via reactions
by - or -containing
called   these enzymes catalyze the reversible
reaction between h2 and its component two protons and two electrons  creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during
to water  the natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the  
  in which water is decomposed into its component protons  electrons  and oxygen  occurs in the
in all
organisms  some such organisms  including the alga
and   have evolved a second step in the
in which protons and electrons are reduced to form h2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the   efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize h2 gas even in the presence of oxygen  efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified  
safety and precautions
main article 
hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety  from potential
and fires when mixed with air to being an
in its pure  -free form  in addition  liquid hydrogen is a
and presents dangers  such as   associated with very cold liquids  hydrogen dissolves in many metals  and  in addition to leaking out  may have adverse effects on them  such as   leading to cracks and explosions  hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite  moreover  hydrogen fire  while being extremely hot  is almost invisible  and thus can lead to accidental burns 
even interpreting the hydrogen data  including safety data  is confounded by a number of phenomena  many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the
ratio  it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio  for which the data is usually given   hydrogen detonation parameters  such as critical detonation pressure and temperature  strongly depend on the container geometry
