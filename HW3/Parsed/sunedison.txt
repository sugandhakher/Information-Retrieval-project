history  
foundation  
the establishment of monsanto electronic materials company  memc   a manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry  was announced on august 6  1959  as an arm of the u s -based multinational corporation   in february 1960 memc started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in   30 miles west of monsanto s headquarters in st  louis  as one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers  memc was a pioneer in the field  and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century  memc used the
 cz process  of
production  and developed the
 cmp  process of wafer finishing  in 1966 memc installed its first reactors for the production of   and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing  which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible 
expansion  
in the early 1970s  memc opened a production plant in     and sent its st  petersproduced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing  in 1979  memc became the first company to manufacture 125mm  5-inch  wafers  in 1981 the first to produce 150mm  6-inch  wafers  and  in partnership with   in 1984 the first to produce 200mm  8-inch  wafers  in 1986 memc opened its production and r d facility in     to serve the japanese semiconductor market  becoming the first non-japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in japan 
change of ownership  
memc experienced heavy price-pressure from japanese competition during the mid 1980s  despite its success and increasing revenues  memc had to account for losses for a few years  leading to the decision of monsanto  which was refocusing on chemicals  agriculture  and biotechnology products  to sell the electronic materials division  in 1989 the german company   the chemicals arm of the german conglomerate   acquired monsanto electronic materials and combined it with hls  previous acquisition
silicon  dns  to form memc electronic materials  dns already operated silicon wafer plants in
and  
and integrated them within the new memc electronic materials  hls supported the new subsidiary with  50million  for research and development and for manufacturing expansion  in 1991 memc developed the first process using
  which provided cost and productivity advantages over  chunk  polysilicon  four years later memc acquired  s granular polysilicon production facility in     which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987 
memc s stock began trading on the
with an
in 1995  the ipo raised over  400million  which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company  and hls veba retained a majority interest in the company 
the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit memc hard  in 1998 the company reported a loss of  316million on revenues of  759million  in june 2000 veba ag  still holding 72  of memc  was merged with
to form the new
ag  e on wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities  and assigned
to sell memc  merrill was unable to find a buyer until memc announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001  finally in october 2001 e on was able to agree on a deal with the
company
 tpg   which purchased e on s stake in memc for a symbolic dollar and offered memc  150million in credit lines  tpg restructured memc s debt  increased its stake in the company to 90   and cut one third of its workforce 
memc returned to profitability following the appointment of   who was ceo of memc from april 2002 to november 2008  memc s market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures  memc s sales topped  1billion in 2004  and it was number three in market share  through a secondary offering  tpg reduced its share of memc in 2005 to 34   and by the end of 2007  to zero 
solar market entry  
sunedison solar testing facility
in 2006 memc announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning
market  via longterm agreements to supply china-based
and taiwan-based gintech energy with solar-grade silicon wafers  similar contracts followed with germany-based
in 2007  and taiwan-based tainergy tech in 2008  the company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well  by 2007  memc held approximately 14  of the solar wafer market  having returned memc to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market  ceo nabeel gareeb resigned in november 2008  ahmad chatila was appointed president and ceo in february 2009 
in july 2009 memc and   which specialized in construction and operation of
plants  formed a
to build   a 50
photovoltaic plant in     with memc supplying the
and q-cells converting them into   both partners invested  100million each  in return for a 50 -each ownership of the project  as planned  the plant was sold to an investment firm    after operations started at the beginning of 2010 
acquisition of sunedison  
in november 2009 memc acquired the privately owned company sunedison llc  north america s largest
services provider  founded by   sunedison had been developing  financing  building  operating  and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers  including many national retail outlets  government agencies  and utilities  since 2003  the company had pioneered solar-as-a-service  and the solar
 ppa  for no-money-down customer financing  with the acquisition of sunedison  memc became a developer of solar power projects and north america s largest solar energy services provider  ceo ahmad chatila announced that  memc will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy  in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products   sunedison was purchased for  200million  70  in cash and 30  in memc stock  plus retention payments  transaction expenses  and the assumption of net debt 
following its acquisition of sunedison  memc also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of low-cost  high-performance solar panels  it acquired the california-based solar tech company solaicx in mid 2010  the acquisition included solaicx s high-volume proprietary  continuous crystal growth  manufacturing technology  which produces low-cost
for high-efficiency solar cells 
in february 2011
and memc announced a 50/50 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in   the plant was to have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum  as of late 2014 the joint venture  called smp  is 85  owned by sunedison  50  by sunedison  inc  and 35  by sunedison semiconductor  and 15  by samsung  and the plant has a capacity of 13,500 metric tons per annum  by october 2014  the plant began producing the worlds first high-pressure fluidized bed reactor  hp-fbr  polysilicon  enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy 
in 2011 memc also extended its solar-energy business  in june 2011  it acquired another north american solar-power project developer  axio power  axio power  founded in 2007  developed  financed  and constructed large-scale solar projects  and had more than 500 mw of utility-scale photovoltaic power projects in canada and the western u s  in july 2011  memc established a joint venture with korea-based jusung engineering  to combine its proprietary solaicx ccz monocrystalline wafers with jusung s high-efficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide low-cost  high-efficiency solar cells  in september 2011  memc acquired fotowatio renewable ventures inc   the u s  unit of fotowatio renewable ventures  a developer  operator and owner of solar power plants  the frv purchase added up to 1.4 gw of solar projects in the u s  to memc s portfolio 
in december 2011 memc undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules  the company announced a headcount reduction of 1,300 employees  18  of the workforce   plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers 
in 2012 memc developed its silvantis line of multi-crystalline 290-watt solar modules  with 1,000-volt ul certification  the modules created considerable overall energy-production and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired 
name change  
on may 30  2013  memc electronic materials changed its name to sunedison  inc   and also changed its stock-market ticker from  wfr  to  sune   reflecting the company s focus on solar energy  in may 2014  sunedison formally separated its electronics-wafer business from its solar-wafer and solar-energy business  sunedison semiconductor  ltd  spun off in an
on the nasdaq under the ticker  semi   with sunedison  inc  maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder  the ipo generated  94million  used to fund the company s growth 
in july 2014  sunedison created a
subsidiary  called terraform power  inc   with sunedison  inc  maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder  terraform began publicly trading in an ipo under the ticker  terp   this ipo of the power-generation subsidiary spin-off raised roughly  500million  sunedison launched a second yieldco subsidiary  terraform global  in 2015  to manage renewable-energy projects in emerging markets like brazil  china  and india  this second yieldco trades on the nasdaq under the ticker  glbl  
in october 2014 sunedison announced the development of  zero white space  solar modules  which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface  that month it also announced the implementation of  high-pressure    hp-fbr  technology  producing high-purity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90  less energy used than non-fbr technologies 
in november 2014  with its subsidiary terraform power  sunedison purchased   one of the largest wind power developers in the united states  for  2.4billion  the acquisition added
to sunedison s capacity  and made it the leading
development company in the world 
in 2015 
named sunedison  6  and the top energy company  in its annual  50 smartest companies  list  the review characterized sunedison as  aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world  
in june 2015  sunedison  inc  announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business  the publicly traded company sunedison semiconductor  the completion of the sell-off finalized sunedison s transition into a dedicated renewable-energy company 
bankruptcy  
following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent  which eventually fell through  to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company
in 2015  sunedison s stock plummeted and its more than  11billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in april 2016  it filed for
bankruptcy protection on april 21  2016  to continue its operations and pay staff  the company received  300 million in bankruptcy debt financing  it will continue operations during bankruptcy  the debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders  the bankruptcy court must approve the money 
when it filed for bankruptcy  the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the companys recent financial transactions  sunedison requested that the examiners work start immediately and finish within 60 days  and that the maximum budget be  1 million 
noted that  comparatively  the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of
took one year and cost  40 million 
during the summer of 2015  sunedison was worth almost  10 billion  and in july 2015 shares traded upward of  33.44  on the day of the bankruptcy filing  the companys trading price on the new york stock exchange was 34 cents per share 
according to the wall street journal  sunedison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model  during the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing  sunedison invested  18 billion in acquisitions  during that time  the company also raised  24 billion in debt and equity 
as of late april 2016  the u s  department of justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices  internally  sunedisons board completed its own investigation  concluding that the companys leaders were overly optimistic but did not make material misstatements or commit any fraud
