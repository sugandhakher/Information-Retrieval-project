main article 
methanol is a fuel for heat engines and fuel cells  due to its high
it can be used directly as a fuel in
 including
and
vehicles  using existing internal combustion engines  ice   methanol can also be used as a fuel in fuel cells  either directly in
 dmfc  or indirectly  after conversion into
by reforming  
in an economy based on methanol  methanol could be used as a fuel 
in internal combustion engines  ices 
methanol has a high
 ron of 107 and mon of 92   making it a suitable gasoline substitute  it has a higher
than gasoline  leading to higher efficiency as well as a higher latent heat of vaporization  3.7 times higher than gasoline   meaning that the heat generated by the engine can be removed more effectively  making it possible to use air cooled engines  methanol can have an efficiency increase of 5  to 10  relative to gasoline engine efficiency  if the compression ratio is increased  methanol burns cleaner than gasoline and is safer in the case of a fire  but has only half the volumetric energy content of gasoline  15.6 mj l vs  32.4 mj l  
in compression ignition engines   
methanol itself is not a good substitute for   methanol can  however  be converted by
to   which is a good diesel fuel with a
of 55-60 as compared to 45-55 for regular diesel fuel  this improves its cold-start ability in winters and reduces its noise  compared to diesel fuel  dme has much lower emissions of nox and co and emits no particulate matter  sox  methanol can also be  and is in fact already  used to produce
via
of
   
in advanced methanol-powered vehicles
the use of methanol and dimethyl ether can be combined with hybrid and
technologies allowing higher gas mileage and lower emissions  these fuels can also be used in fuel cells either via onboard reforming to hydrogen or directly in
 dmfc  
for electricity production
methanol and dme can be used in existing
to generate electricity 
 pafc  mcfc  sofc  can also be used for electricity generation 
as a domestic fuel
methanol and dme can be used in commercial buildings and homes to generate heat and or electricity  dme can be used in a commercial gas stove without modifications  dme can also be blended with lpg and used as a cooking or heating fuel as is already the case in china  in developing countries methanol could be used as a cooking fuel  burning much cleaner than wood and thus mitigating indoor air quality problems 
precursor  
methanol is already used today on a large scale as raw material to produce a variety of chemicals and products  through the methanol-to-gasoline  mtg  process  it can be transformed into gasoline  using the methanol-to-olefin  mto  process  methanol can also be converted to
and   the two chemicals produced in largest amounts by the petrochemical industry  these are important building blocks for the production of essential polymers  ldpe  hdpe  pp  and like other chemical intermediates are currently produced mainly from petroleum feedstock  their production from methanol could therefore reduce our dependency on petroleum  it would also make it possible to continue producing these chemicals when fossil fuels reserves are depleted 
production  
methanol is already used today on a large scale  about 37 million tonnes per year  as a raw material to produce numerous chemical products and materials  in addition  it can be readily converted in the
 mto  process into ethylene and propylene  which can be used to produce synthetic hydrocarbons and their products  currently obtained from oil and natural gas 
today most
is produced from
through  
is currently the world s largest methanol exporter  with exports mainly to the   although conventional natural gas resources are currently the preferred feedstock for the production of methanol  unconventional gas resources such as   tight sand gas and eventually the very large
resources present under the continental shelves of the seas and siberian and canadian tundra could also be used  besides methane all other conventional or unconventional     etc   fossil fuels could be utilized to produce methanol 
besides the conventional route to methanol from
passing through syngas generation by steam reforming combined  or not  with partial oxidation  new and more efficient ways to produce methanol from methane are being developed  these include 
methane oxidation with homogeneous catalysts in
media
methane bromination followed by hydrolysis of the obtained
direct oxidation of methane with oxygen
microbial or photochemical conversion of methane
the use of methane or another fossil fuel for the production of methanol using all the above-mentioned synthetic routes has a potential drawback  the emission of the
co2  to mitigate this  methanol can be made through ways minimizing the emission of co2  one solution is to produce it from syngas obtained by biomass gasification  for this purpose any biomass can be used including   wood wastes  grass  agricultural crops and their by-products  animal waste  aquatic plants and municipal waste  there is no need to use food crops as in the case of ethanol from corn  sugar cane and wheat 
biomass  syngas  co  co2  h2   ch3oh
the methanol needed in the methanol economy can be synthesized not only from a wide array of carbon sources including still available
and
but also co2 emitted from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industries and eventually even the co2 contained in the air  methanol can be efficiently produced from a wide variety of sources including still-abundant fossil fuels          etc    but also agricultural products and municipal waste 
and varied   it can also be made from chemical recycling of   which
has demonstrated with its first commercial scale plant  initially the major source will be the co2 rich flue gases of fossil-fuel-burning power plants or exhaust from cement and other factories  in the longer range however  considering diminishing fossil fuel resources and the effect of their utilization on   even the low concentration of atmospheric co2 itself could be captured and recycled via methanol  thus supplementing natures own photosynthetic cycle  efficient new absorbents to capture atmospheric co2 are being developed  mimicking plants  ability  chemical recycling of co2 to new fuels and materials could thus become feasible  making them renewable on the human timescale 
methanol can also be produced from co2 by
of co2 with h2 where the hydrogen has been obtained from   this is the process used by
of   methanol may also be produced through co2   if electrical power is available  the energy needed for these reactions in order to be carbon neutral would come from renewable energy sources such as wind  hydroelectricity and solar as well as nuclear power  in effect  all of them allow free energy to be stored in easily transportable methanol  which is made immediately from hydrogen and carbon dioxide  rather than attempting to store energy in free hydrogen 
co2   3h2  ch3oh   h2o
or with electric energy

6 ho1  3h2o   2/3 o2   6 e1
total 
co2  2h2o   electric energy  ch3oh   2/3 o2
the necessary co2 would be captured from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industrial
including cement factories  with diminishing fossil fuel resources and therefore co2 emissions  the co2 content in the air could also be used  considering the low concentration of co2 in air  0.04   improved and economically viable technologies to absorb co2 will have to be developed  this would allow the chemical recycling of co2  thus mimicking natures photosynthesis 
advantages  
in the process of   green plants use the energy of sunlight to split water into free oxygen  which is released  and free hydrogen  rather than attempt to store the hydrogen  plants immediately capture carbon dioxide from the air to allow the hydrogen to reduce it to storable fuels such as hydrocarbons  plant oils and   and polyalcohols   
and    in the methanol economy  any process which similarly produces free hydrogen  proposes to immediately use it  captively  to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol  which  like plant products from photosynthesis  has great advantages in storage and transport over free hydrogen itself 
methanol is a liquid under normal conditions  allowing it to be stored  transported and dispensed easily  much like
and   it can also be readily transformed by dehydration into   a diesel fuel substitute with a
of 55 
comparison with hydrogen  
methanol economy advantages compared to a hydrogen economy 
efficient energy storage by volume  as compared with   and when hydrogen pressure-confinement vessel is taken into account  an advantage in energy storage by weight can also be realized  the volumetric energy density of methanol is considerably higher than liquid hydrogen  in part because of the low density of liquid hydrogen of 71grams litre  hence there is actually more hydrogen in a litre of methanol  99grams litre  than in a litre of liquid hydrogen  and methanol needs no cryogenic container maintained at a temperature of -253c  
a liquid hydrogen infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive  methanol can use existing gasoline infrastructure with only limited modifications 
can be blended with gasoline  for example in   a mixture containing 85  methanol and 15  gasoline  
user friendly  hydrogen is volatile and requires high pressure or cryogenic system confinement 
less losses  making storage systems hydrogen leakage proof is a lot more difficult then preventing leakage from methanol  with liquid hydrogen heat will evaporate liquid  giving expected losses up to 0.3  per day in storage tanks due to release of overpressure  see   
methanol may be viewed as a compact way of storing hydrogen  one m3 of methanol at ambient pressure and temperature contains 1660 nm3    of hydrogen gas  h2   this may be compared to
where one m3 of liquid hydrogen  lh2  at -253c contains only 788 nm3 of hydrogen gas 
comparison with ethanol  
can be made from any organic material using proven technology going through syngas  there is no need to use food crops and compete with food production  the amount of methanol that can be generated from biomass is much greater than ethanol 
can compete with and complement ethanol in a diversified energy marketplace  methanol obtained from fossil fuels has a lower price than ethanol 
can be blended in gasoline like ethanol  in 2007  china blended more than 1billion us gallons  3,800,000m3  of methanol into fuel and will introduce methanol fuel standard by mid-2008    a mixture of 85  methanol and 15  gasoline can be used much like
sold in some gas stations today 
disadvantages  
high energy costs associated with generating hydrogen  when needed to synthesize methanol 
depending on the feedstock the generation in itself may be not clean
presently generated from
still dependent on fossil fuels  although in theory any energy source can be used  
energy density  by weight or volume  one half of that of gasoline and 24  less than ethanol
to some metals including  
and   parts of the engine fuel-intake systems are made from aluminum  similar to ethanol  compatible material for fuel tanks  gasket and engine intake have to be used 
as with   existing
designed for petroleum products cannot handle methanol  thus methanol requires shipment at higher energy cost in trucks and trains  until a whole new pipeline infrastructure can be built 
methanol  as an alcohol  increases the permeability of some plastics to fuel vapors  e g  high-density polyethylene   this property of methanol has the possibility of increasing emissions of
 vocs  from fuel  which contributes to increased tropospheric
and possibly human exposure 
low volatility in cold weather  pure methanol-fueled engines can be difficult to start  and they run inefficiently until warmed up  this is why a mixture containing 85  methanol and 15  gasoline called m85 is generally used in ices  the gasoline allows the engine to start even at lower temperatures 
with the exception of low level exposure  methanol is toxic  methanol is lethal when ingested in larger amounts  30 to 100 ml   but so are most motor fuels  including gasoline  120 to 300 ml  and diesel fuel  gasoline also contains many compounds known to be carcinogenic  e g  benzene   methanol is not a carcinogen  nor does it contain any carcinogens  however  methanol may be metabolized in the body to formaldehyde  which is both toxic and carcinogenic  methanol occurs naturally in small quantities in the human body and in edible fruits 
methanol is a liquid  this creates a greater fire risk compared to hydrogen in open spaces  methanol leaks do not dissipate  a methanol-based fire burns invisibly unlike gasoline  compared to gasoline  however  methanol is much safer  it is more difficult to ignite and releases less heat when it burns  methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water  whereas gasoline floats on water and continues to burn  the epa has estimated that switching fuels from gasoline to methanol would reduce the incidence of fuel related fires by 90  
methanol accidentally released from leaking underground fuel storage tanks may undergo relatively rapid groundwater transport and contaminate well water  although this risk has not been thoroughly studied  the history of the fuel additive methyl t-butyl ether    as a groundwater contaminant has highlighted the importance of assessing the potential impacts of fuel and fuel additives on multiple environmental media  an accidental release of methanol in the environment would  however  cause much less damage than a comparable gasoline or crude oil spill  unlike these fuels  methanol  being totally soluble in water  would be rapidly diluted to a concentration low enough for
to start   methanol is in fact used for
in water treatment plants as a nutrient for bacteria
