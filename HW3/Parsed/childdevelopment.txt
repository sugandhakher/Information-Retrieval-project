child development entails the  
and emotional changes that occur in human beings between birth and the end of   as the individual progresses from dependency to increasing   it is a continuous process with a predictable sequence yet having a unique course for every child  it does not progress at the same rate and each stage is affected by the preceding types of development  because these developmental changes may be strongly influenced by genetic factors and events during prenatal life  genetics and prenatal development are usually included as part of the study of child development  related terms include   referring to development throughout the lifespan  and   the branch of medicine relating to the care of children  developmental change may occur as a result of genetically-controlled processes known as   or as a result of environmental factors and learning  but most commonly involves an interaction between the two  it may also occur as a result of human nature and our ability to learn from our environment 
there are various definitions of periods in a child s development  since each period is a continuum with individual differences regarding start and ending  some age-related development periods and examples of defined intervals are 
 ages 04 weeks  
 ages 4 weeks  1 year  
 ages 13 years  
 ages 46 years  
 ages 613 years  
 ages 1319  
promoting child development through parental training  among other factors  promotes excellent rates of child development  parents play a large role in a child s life  socialization  and development  having multiple parents can add stability to the child s life and therefore encourage healthy development  another influential factor in a child s development is the quality of their care 
programs present a critical opportunity for the promotion of child development 
the optimal development of children is considered vital to society and so it is important to understand the social  cognitive  emotional  and educational development of children  increased research and interest in this field has resulted in new theories and strategies  with specific regard to practice that promotes development within the school system  in addition there are also some theories that seek to describe a sequence of states that compose child development

ecological systems  
main article 
also called  development in context  or  human ecology  theory  ecological systems theory  originally formulated by
specifies four types of nested environmental systems  with bi-directional influences within and between the systems  the four systems are microsystem  mesosystem  exosystem  and macrosystem  each system contains roles  norms and rules that can powerfully shape development  since its publication in 1979  bronfenbrenner s major statement of this theory  the ecology of human development has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments  as a result of this influential conceptualization of development  these environments  from the family to economic and political structures  have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through adulthood 
piaget  
main articles 
and
jean piaget was a swiss scholar who began his studies in intellectual development in the 1920s  piagets first interests were those that dealt with the ways in which animals adapt to their environments and his first scientific article about this subject was published when he was 10 years old  this eventually led him to pursue a ph d  in zoology  which then led him to his second interest in epistemology 
branches off from philosophy and deals with the origin of knowledge  piaget believed the origin of knowledge came from psychology  so he traveled to paris and began working on the first standardized intelligence test at alfred binet laboratories  this influenced his career greatly  as he carried out this intelligence testing he began developing a profound interest in the way childrens intellectualism works  as a result  he developed his own laboratory and spent years recording childrens intellectual growth and attempted to find out how children develop through various stages of thinking  this led to piaget develop four important stages of cognitive development  sensorimotor stage  birth to age 2   preoperational stage  age 2 to 7   concrete-operational stage  ages 7 to 12   and formal-operational stage  ages 11 to 12  and thereafter  
stages  
sensorimotor   birth to about age 2 
this is the first stage in piaget s theory  where infants have the following basic senses  vision  hearing  and motor skills  in this stage  knowledge of the world is limited but is constantly developing due to the child s experiences and interactions    according to piaget  when an infant reaches about 79 months of age they begin to develop what he called   this means the child now has the ability to understand that objects keep existing even when they cannot be seen  an example of this would be hiding the childs favorite toy under a blanket  although the child cannot physically see it they still know to look under the blanket 
preoperational   begins about the time the child starts to talk about age 7 
during this stage of development  young children begin analyzing their environment using mental symbols  these symbols often include words and images and the child will begin to apply these various symbols in their everyday lives as they come across different objects  events  and situations  however  piagets main focus on this stage and the reason why he named it preoperational is because children at this point are not able to apply specific cognitive operations  such as mental math  in addition to symbolism  children start to engage in pretend play in which they pretend to be people they are not  teachers  superheroes   in addition  they sometimes use different props to make this pretend play more real  some deficiencies in this stage of development are that children who are about 34 years old often display what is called   which means the child is not able to see someone elses point of view  they feel as if every other person is experiencing the same events and feelings that they are experiencing  however  at about at 7 thought processes of children are no longer egocentric and are more intuitive  meaning they now think about the way something looks instead of rational thinking 
concrete   about first grade to early adolescence 
during this stage  children between the age of 7 and 11 use appropriate logic to develop cognitive operations and begin applying this new thinking to different events they may encounter  children in this stage incorporate   which involves drawing conclusions from other observations in order to make a generalization    unlike the preoperational stage  children can now change and rearrange mental images and symbols to form a logical thought  an example of this is reversibility in which the child now has the ability to reverse an action just by doing the opposite 
formal operations   about early adolescence to mid late adolescence 
the final stage of piagets cognitive development defines a child as now having the ability to think more rationally and systematically about abstract concepts and hypothetical events  some positive aspects during this time is that child or adolescent begins forming their identity and begin understanding why people behave the way they behave  however  there are also some negative aspects which include the child or adolescent developing some egocentric thoughts which include the
and the   an imaginary audience is when an adolescent feels that the world is just as concerned and judgemental of anything the adolescent does as they are  an adolescent may feel as is they are on stage and everyone is a critique and they are the ones being critiqued  a personal fable is when the adolescent feels that he or she is a unique person and everything they do is unique  they feel as if they are the only ones that have ever experienced what they are experiencing and that they are invincible and nothing bad will happen to them it will only happen to others 
vygotsky  
main articles 
and
vygotsky was a russian theorist  who proposed the sociocultural theory  during the 1920s1930s while piaget was developing his own theory  vygotsky was an active scholar and at that time his theory was said to be recent because it was translated out of russian language and began influencing western thinking  he posited that children learn through hands-on experience  as piaget suggested  however  unlike piaget  he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task  called the   could help children learn new tasks  this technique is called  scaffolding   because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn  an example of this might be when a parent  helps  an infant clap or roll her hands to the
rhyme  until she can clap and roll her hands herself 
vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child s pattern of development  he argued that  every function in the child s cultural development appears twice  first  on the social level  and later  on the individual level  first  between people  interpsychological  and then inside the child  intrapsychological   this applies equally to voluntary attention  to logical memory  and to the formation of concepts  all the higher functions originate as actual relationships between individuals  
vygotsky felt that development was a process and saw periods of crisis in child development during which there was a qualitative transformation in the child s mental functioning 
attachment

attachment theory  originating in the work of

theory that provides a descriptive and explanatory framework for understanding
between human beings  bowlbys observations of close attachments led him to believe that close emotional bonds or attachments between an infant and their primary caregiver is an important requirement that is necessary to form normal social and emotional development

  a follower of freud s  synthesized both freud s and his own theories to create what is known as the
stages of human development  which span from birth to death  and focuses on  tasks  at each stage that must be accomplished to successfully navigate life s challenges 
erikson s eight stages consist of the following 
trust vs  mistrust  infant 
autonomy vs  shame  toddlerhood 
initiative vs  guilt  preschooler

the use of
as a framework for the consideration of development began in the early 1990s and has continued into the present century  dynamic systems theory stresses nonlinear connections  e g   between earlier and later social assertiveness  and the capacity of a system to reorganize as a phase shift that is stage-like in nature  another useful concept for developmentalists is the attractor state  a condition  such as teething or stranger anxiety  that helps to determine apparently unrelated behaviors as well as related ones    dynamic systems theory has been applied extensively to the study of motor development  the theory also has strong associations with some of bowlby s views about attachment systems  dynamic systems theory also relates to the concept of the transactional process  a mutually interactive process in which children and parents simultaneously influence each other  producing developmental change in both over time   
the  core knowledge perspective  is an evolutionary theory in child development that proposes  infants begin life with innate  special-purpose knowledge systems referred to as core domains of thought  there are five core domains of thought  each of which is crucial for survival  which simultaneously prepare us to develop key aspects of early cognition  they are  physical  numerical  linguistic  psychological  and biological   
continuity and discontinuity  
although the identification of developmental milestones is of interest to researchers and to children s caregivers  many aspects of developmental change are continuous and do not display noticeable milestones of change  continuous developmental changes  like growth in stature  involve fairly gradual and predictable progress toward adult characteristics  when developmental change is discontinuous  however  researchers may identify not only milestones of development  but related age periods often called stages  a stage is a period of time  often associated with a known chronological age range  during which a behavior or physical characteristic is qualitatively different from what it is at other ages  when an age period is referred to as a stage  the term implies not only this qualitative difference  but also a predictable sequence of developmental events  such that each stage is both preceded and followed by specific other periods associated with characteristic behavioral or physical qualities 
stages of development may overlap or be associated with specific other aspects of development  such as speech or movement  even within a particular developmental area  transition into a stage may not mean that the previous stage is completely finished  for example  in erikson s discussion of stages of personality  this theorist suggests that a lifetime is spent in reworking issues that were originally characteristic of a childhood stage  similarly  the theorist of cognitive development    described situations in which children could solve one type of problem using mature thinking skills  but could not accomplish this for less familiar problems  a phenomenon he called horizontal decalage 
mechanisms

although developmental change runs parallel with chronological age  age itself cannot cause development  the basic mechanisms or causes of developmental change are genetic factors and environmental factors  genetic factors are responsible for cellular changes like overall growth  changes in proportion of body and brain parts  and the maturation of aspects of function such as vision and dietary needs  because genes can be  turned off  and  turned on   the individual s initial genotype may change in function over time  giving rise to further developmental change  environmental factors affecting development may include both diet and disease exposure  as well as social  emotional  and cognitive experiences  however  examination of environmental factors also shows that young human beings can survive within a fairly broad range of environmental experiences 
rather than acting as independent mechanisms  genetic and environmental factors often interact to cause developmental change  some aspects of child development are notable for their   or the extent to which the direction of development is guided by environmental factors as well as initiated by genetic factors  when an aspect of development is strongly affected by early experience  it is said to show a high degree of   when the genetic make-up is the primary cause of development  plasticity is said to be low  plasticity may involve guidance by endogenous factors like hormones as well as by exogenous factors like infection 
child playing with bubbles
one kind of environmental guidance of development has been described as experience-dependent plasticity  in which behavior is altered as a result of learning from the environment  plasticity of this type can occur throughout the lifespan and may involve many kinds of behavior  including some emotional reactions  a second type of plasticity  experience-expectant plasticity  involves the strong effect of specific experiences during limited sensitive periods of development  for example  the coordinated use of the two eyes  and the experience of a single three-dimensional image rather than the two-dimensional images created by light in each eye  depend on experiences with vision during the second half of the first year of life  experience-expectant plasticity works to fine-tune aspects of development that cannot proceed to optimum outcomes as a result of genetic factors working alone 
in addition to the existence of plasticity in some aspects of development  genetic-environmental correlations may function in several ways to determine the mature characteristics of the individual  genetic-environmental correlations are circumstances in which genetic factors make certain experiences more likely to occur  for example  in passive genetic-environmental correlation  a child is likely to experience a particular environment because his or her parents  genetic make-up makes them likely to choose or create such an environment  in evocative genetic-environmental correlation  the child s genetically-caused characteristics cause other people to respond in certain ways  providing a different environment than might occur for a genetically-different child  for instance  a child with
may be treated more protectively and less challengingly than a non-down child  finally  an active genetic-environmental correlation is one in which the child chooses experiences that in turn have their effect  for instance  a muscular  active child may choose after-school sports experiences that create increased athletic skills  but perhaps preclude music lessons  in all of these cases  it becomes difficult to know whether child characteristics were shaped by genetic factors  by experiences  or by a combination of the two 
research issues and methods  
what develops  what relevant aspects of the individual change over a period of time 
what are the rate and speed of development 
what are the mechanisms of development  what aspects of experience and heredity cause developmental change 
are there typical individual differences in the relevant developmental changes 
are there population differences in this aspect of development  for example  differences in the development of boys and of girls  
empirical research that attempts to answer these questions may follow a number of patterns  initially  observational research in naturalistic conditions may be needed to develop a narrative describing and defining an aspect of developmental change  such as changes in reflex reactions in the first year    this type of work may be followed by correlational studies  collecting information about chronological age and some type of development such as vocabulary growth  correlational statistics can be used to state change  such studies examine the characteristics of children at different ages    these methods may involve longitudinal studies  in which a group of children are re-examined on a number of occasions as they get older or cross-sectional studies  in which groups of children of different ages are tested once and compared with each other  or there may be a combination of these approaches  some child development studies examine the effects of experience or heredity by comparing characteristics of different groups of children in a necessarily non-randomized design    other studies can use randomized designs to compare outcomes for groups of children who receive different interventions or educational treatments 
milestones  
main article 
milestones are changes in specific physical and mental abilities  such as walking and understanding language  that mark the end of one developmental period and the beginning of another    for stage theories  milestones indicate a stage transition  studies of the accomplishment of many developmental tasks have established typical chronological ages associated with developmental milestones  however  there is considerable variation in the achievement of milestones  even between children with developmental trajectories within the typical range  some milestones are more variable than others  for example  receptive speech indicators do not show much variation among children with typical hearing  but expressive speech milestones can be quite variable   
a common concern in child development is
involving a delay in an age-specific ability for important developmental milestones  prevention of and early intervention in developmental delay are significant topics in the study of child development    developmental delays should be diagnosed by comparison with characteristic variability of a milestone  not with respect to average age at achievement  an example of a milestone would be eye-hand coordination  which includes a child s increasing ability to manipulate objects in a coordinated manner  increased knowledge of age-specific milestones allows parents and others to keep track of    
there is a phenomenal growth or exponential increase of child development from the age of 4 to 15 years old especially during the age of 4 to 7 years old based on the yamana chart    the heckman s chart shows that the highest return of investment in education is maximum during the early years  age 1 to 3 years old  and decreases to a plateau during the school aged years and adolescence  there are various child development tables or charts e g  the piles table where piles stands for physical  intellectual  language  emotional and social development aspects 
aspects  
child development is not a matter of a single topic  but progresses somewhat differently for different aspects of the individual  here are descriptions of the development of a number of physical and mental characteristics   
physical growth  
physical growth in
and weight occurs over the 1520 years following birth  as the individual changes from the average weight of 3.5kg and length of 50cm at
birth to full adult size  as stature and weight increase  the individual s
also change  from the relatively large head and small
and
of the   to the adult s relatively small head and long torso and limbs  the childs pattern of growth is in a head-to-toe direction  or cephalocaudal  and in an inward to outward pattern  center of the body to the peripheral  called proximodistal 
speed and pattern  
the speed of physical growth is rapid in the months after birth  then slows  so birth weight is doubled in the first four months  tripled by age 12 months  but not quadrupled until 24 months    growth then proceeds at a slow rate until shortly before puberty  between about 9 and 15 years of age   when a period of rapid growth occurs    growth is not uniform in rate and timing across all body parts  at birth  head size is already relatively near to that of an adult  but the lower parts of the body are much smaller than adult size  in the course of development  then  the head grows relatively little  and torso and limbs undergo a great deal of growth 
mechanisms of change  
genetic factors play a major role in determining the growth rate  and particularly the changes in proportion characteristic of early human development  however  genetic factors can produce the maximum growth only if environmental conditions are adequate  poor nutrition and frequent injury and disease can reduce the individual s adult stature  but the best environment cannot cause growth to a greater stature than is determined by heredity 
individual variation versus disease  
individual differences in height and weight during childhood are considerable  some of these differences are due to family genetic factors  others to environmental factors  but at some points in development they may be strongly influenced by individual differences in reproductive maturation 
the
defines
as height more than 2
below the
for age and gender  which corresponds to the shortest 2.3  of individuals  in contrast 
is usually defined in terms of   and can be evaluated either by a low weight for the child s age  or by a low rate of increase in the weight  a similar term    generally refers to reduced growth rate as a manifestation of
in early childhood 
motor  
a child learning to walk
abilities for physical movement change through childhood from the largely reflexive  unlearned  involuntary  movement patterns of the young infant to the highly skilled voluntary movements characteristic of later childhood and adolescence 
definition  
 motor learning refers to the increasing spatial and temporal accuracy of movements with practice  
can be divided into two categories  first as basic skills necessary for everyday life and secondly  as recreational skills such as skills for employment or certain specialties based on interest 
speed and pattern  
the speed of motor development is rapid in early life  as many of the reflexes of the newborn alter or disappear within the first year  and slows later  like physical growth  motor development shows predictable patterns of cephalocaudal  head to foot  and
  to extremities  development  with movements at the head and in the more central areas coming under control before those of the lower part of the body or the hands and feet  types of movement develop in stage-like sequences    for example  locomotion at 68 months involves creeping on all fours  then proceeds to pulling to stand   cruising  while holding on to an object 
while holding an adult s hand  and finally walking independently    older children continue the sequence by walking sideways or backward  galloping  hopping  skipping with one foot and walking with the other  and finally skipping    by middle childhood and adolescence  new motor skills are acquired by instruction or observation rather than in a predictable sequence  there are
of the brain  working memory  timing measure of inhibition and switching  which are important to motor skills  critiques to the order of executive functioning leads to motor skills  suggesting motor skills can support executive functioning in the brain   
mechanisms  
the mechanisms involved in motor development involve some genetic components that determine the physical size of body parts at a given age  as well as aspects of muscle and bone strength    the main areas of the brain involved in motor skills are the  
and   the
is responsible for strategic processing  the parietal cortex is important in controlling perceptual-motor integration and the basal ganglia and supplementary
are responsible for motor sequences  nutrition and exercise also determine strength and therefore the ease and accuracy with which a body part can be moved  flexibility is also affected by nutrition and exercise as well  it has also been shown that the
develops posterio-anteriorally  from back to front   this is significant in motor development because the hind portion of the frontal lobe is known to control motor functions  this form of development is known as  portional development  and explains why motor functions develop relatively quickly during typical childhood development  while logic  which is controlled by the middle and front portions of the frontal lobe  usually will not develop until late childhood and early adolescence  opportunities to carry out movements help establish the abilities to flex  move toward the trunk  and extend body parts  both capacities are necessary for good motor ability  skilled voluntary movements such as passing objects from hand to hand develop as a result of practice and learning  mastery climate is a suggested successful learning environment for children to promote motor skills by their own motivation  this promotes participation and active learning in children  which according to
is extremely important in early childhood rule 
individual differences  
typical individual differences in motor ability are common and depend in part on the child s weight and build  however  after the infant period  typical individual differences are strongly affected by opportunities to practice  observe  and be instructed on specific movements  atypical motor development such as persistent
beyond 46 months or delayed walking may be an indication of
or conditions such as     or
  lower motor coordination results in difficulties with speed accuracy and trade-off in complex tasks 
children with disabilities  
children with
or
are late to reach major motor skills milestones  a few examples of these milestones are sucking  grasping  rolling  sitting up and walking    children with down syndrome sometimes have heart problems      or undeveloped muscle mass  this
is caused by atypical
development  along with down syndrome  children can also be diagnosed with a learning disability 
include disabilities in any of the areas related to language  reading  and mathematics  basic reading skills is the most common learning disability in children  which  like other disabilities  focuses on the difference between a childs academic achievement and his or her apparent capacity to learn 
population differences  
regardless of the culture a baby is born into  they are born with a few core domains of knowledge  these principals allow him or her to make sense of their environment and learn upon previous experience by using motor skills such as grasping or crawling  there are some population differences in motor development  with girls showing some advantages in small muscle usage  including
of sounds with lips and tongue    ethnic differences in reflex movements of newborn infants have been reported  suggesting that some biological factor is at work    cultural differences may encourage learning of motor skills like using the left hand only for sanitary purposes and the right hand for all other uses  producing a population difference    cultural factors are also seen at work in practiced voluntary movements such as the use of the foot to dribble a soccer ball or the hand to dribble a basketball 
cognitive intellectual  
this section needs expansion  you can help by    june 2008 
is primarily concerned with ways in which infants and children acquire  develop  and use internal mental capabilities such as  
and  
what develops   
the capacity to     and
  and to solve   exists at a simple level in young infants  who can perform cognitive tasks such as discriminating animate and inanimate beings or recognizing small numbers of objects    during childhood  learning and information-processing increase in speed 
becomes increasingly longer  and symbol use and the capacity for
develop  until a near-adult level is reached by  
mechanisms  
has
and other biological mechanisms  as is seen in the many genetic causes of     environmental factors including food and   responsiveness of parents  daily experiences  physical activity and love can influence early brain development of children  however  although it is assumed that
cause cognitive events  it has not been possible to measure specific brain changes and show that they cause cognitive change    developmental advances in
are also related to experience and learning  and this is particularly the case for higher-level abilities like abstraction  which depend to a considerable extent on formal education 
speed and pattern  
the ability to learn temporal patterns in sequenced actions was investigated in elementary-school age children 
depends upon a process of integrating timing patterns with action sequences  children ages 613 and young adults performed a serial response time task in which a response and a timing sequence were presented repeatedly in a phase-matched manner  allowing for   the degree of integrative learning was measured as the slowing in performance that resulted when phase-shifting the sequences  learning was similar for the children and adults on average but increased with age for the children  executive function measured by
performance as well as a measure of response speed also improved with age  finally  wcst performance and response speed predicted temporal learning  taken together  the results indicate that temporal learning continues to develop in pre-adolescents and that maturing executive function or processing speed may play an important role in acquiring temporal patterns in sequenced actions and the development of this ability 
individual differences  
there are typical individual differences in the ages at which specific cognitive abilities are achieved    but schooling for children in industrialized countries is based on the assumption that these differences are not large    atypical delays in cognitive development are problematic for children in cultures that demand advanced cognitive skills for work and for independent living 
population differences  
there are few population differences in cognitive development    boys and girls show some differences in their skills and preferences  but there is a great deal of overlap between the groups    differences in cognitive achievement of different ethnic groups appears to result from cultural or other environmental factors 
social-emotional  
factors  
newborn infants do not seem to experience fear or have preferences for contact with any specific people  in the first few months they only experience happiness  sadness  and anger    a babys first smile usually occurs between 6 and 10 weeks  it is called a social smile because it usually occurs during social interactions    by about 812 months  they go through a fairly rapid change and become fearful of   they also begin to prefer familiar people and show anxiety and distress when separated from them or approached by strangers   
separation anxiety is a typical stage of development to an extent  kicking  screaming  and throwing temper
are perfectly typical symptoms for   depending on the level of intensity  one may determine whether or not a child has   this is when a child constantly refuses to separate from the parent  but in an intense manner  this can be given special treatment but the parent usually cannot do anything about the situation 
the capacity for
and the understanding of social rules begin in the preschool period and continue to develop into adulthood    middle childhood is characterized by friendships with age-mates  and adolescence by emotions connected with sexuality and the beginnings of romantic love    anger seems most intense during the toddler and early preschool period and during adolescence 
speed and pattern  
some aspects of social-emotional development    like empathy    develop gradually  but others  like fearfulness    seem to involve a rather sudden reorganization of the child s experience of emotion    sexual and romantic emotions develop in connection with physical maturation 
mechanisms  
genetic factors appear to regulate some social-emotional developments that occur at predictable ages  such as fearfulness  and
to familiar people  experience plays a role in determining which people are familiar  which
are obeyed  and how anger is expressed 
parenting practices have been shown to predict children s emotional intelligence  the objective is to study the time mothers and children spent together in joint activity  the types of activities that they develop when they are together  and the relation that those activities have with the children s trait emotional intelligence  data was collected for both mothers and children  n   159  using self-report questionnaires  correlations between time variables and trait emotional intelligence dimensions were computed using   partial correlations between the same variables controlling for responsive parenting were also computed  the amount of time mothers spent with their children and the quality of their interactions are important in terms of children s trait emotional intelligence  not only because those times of joint activity reflect a more positive parenting  but because they are likely to promote modeling  reinforcement  shared attention  and social cooperation 
population differences  
population differences may occur in older children  if  for example they have learned that it is appropriate for boys to express emotion or behave differently from girls    or if customs learned by children of one ethnic group are different from those learned in another    social and emotional differences between boys and girls of a given age may also be associated with differences in the timing of
characteristic of the two sexes 
language and communication  
main article 
mechanisms  
language serves the purpose of communication to express oneself though a systematic and traditional use of sounds  signs  or written symbols  there are four subcomponents in which the child must attain in order to acquire language competence  they include phonology  lexicon  morphology and syntax  and pragmatics  these subcomponents of language development are combined to form the components of language  which are
and   currently  there is no single accepted theory of language acquisition but various explanations of language development have been accumulated 
components  
the four components of language development include 
is concerned with the sounds of language  it is the function  behavior  and organization of sounds as linguistic items  phonology considers what the sounds of language are and what the rules are for combining sounds  phonological acquisition in children can be measured by accuracy and frequency of production of various vowels and consonants  the acquisition of phonemic contrasts and distinctive features  or by viewing development in regular stages in their own speech sound systems and to characterize systematic strategies they adopt 
is a complex dictionary of words that enables language speakers to use these words in speech production and comprehension  lexicon is the inventory of a language s   morphemes act as minimal meaning-bearing elements or building blocks of something in language that makes sense  for example  in the word  cat   the component  cat  makes sense as does  at   but  at  does not mean the same thing as  cat   in this example   ca  does not mean anything 
is the study of form or forms  it is the mental system involved in word formation or to the branch of linguistics that deals with words  their internal structure and how they are formed 
is the study of relationships between linguistic forms and the users of those forms  it also incorporates the use of utterance to serve different functions and can be defined as the ability to communicate one s feelings and desires to others 
childrens development of language also includes
which is the attachment of meaning to words  this happens in three stages  first  each word means an entire sentence  for example  a young child may say mama but the child may mean here is mama  where is mama   or i see mama  in the second stage  words have meaning but do not have complete definitions  this stage occurs around age two or three  third  around age seven or eight  words have adult-like definitions and their meanings are more complete

of his or her language when he or she is able to join words together into sentences and understand multiple-word sentences said by other people  there appear to be six major stages in which a childs acquisition of syntax develops  first  is the use of sentence-like words in which the child communicates using one word with additional vocal and bodily cues  this stage usually occurs between 12 and 18 months of age  second  between 18 months to two years  there is the modification stage where children communicate relationships by modifying a topic word  the third stage  between two and three years old  involves the child using complete subject-predicate structures to communicate relationships  fourth  children make changes on basic sentence structure that enables them to communicate more complex relationships  this stage occurs between the ages of two and a half years to four years  the fifth stage of categorization involves children aged three and a half to seven years refining their sentences with more purposeful word choice that reflects their complex system of categorizing word types  finally  children use structures of language that involve more complicate syntactic relationships between the ages of five years old to ten years old 
milestones  
infants begin with cooing and soft vowel sounds  shortly after birth  this system is developed as the infants begin to understand that their noises  or non-verbal communication  lead to a response from their caregiver  this will then progress into babbling around 5 months of age  with infants first babbling consonant and vowel sounds together that may sound like  ma  or  da   at around 8 months of age  babbling increases to include repetition of sounds  such as  da-da  and infants learn the forms for words and which sounds are more likely to follow other sounds  at this stage  much of the childs communication is open to interpretation  for example  if a child says bah when theyre in a toy room with their guardian  it is likely to be interpreted as ball because the toy is in sight  however  if you were to listen to the same word on a recorded tape without knowing the context  one might not be able to figure out what the child was trying to say  a child s   the understanding of others    has a gradual development beginning at about 6 months  however    the production of words  moves rapidly after its beginning at about a year of age  with a  vocabulary explosion  of rapid word acquisition occurring in the middle of the second year  grammatical rules and word combinations appear at about age two  between 20 and 28 months  children move from understanding the difference between high and low  hot and cold and begin to change no to wait a minute  not now and why  eventually  they are able to add pronouns to words and combine them to form short sentences  mastery of vocabulary and
continue gradually through the preschool and school years  adolescents still have smaller vocabularies than adults and experience more difficulty with constructions such as the passive voice 
by age 1  the child is able to say 12 words  responds to its name  imitates familiar sounds and can follow simple instructions  between 12 years old  the child uses 520 words  is able to say 2-word sentences and is able to express their wishes by saying words like  more  or  up   and they understand the word  no   during 2 and 3 years of age  the child is able to refer to itself as  me   combine nouns and verbs  has a vocabulary of about 450 words  use short sentences  use some simple plurals and is able to answer  where  questions  by age 4  children are able to use sentences of 45 words and has a vocabulary of about 1000 words  children between the ages of 4 and 5 years old are able to use past tense  have a vocabulary of about 1,500 words  and ask questions like  why   and  who    by age 6  the child has a vocabulary of 2,600 words  is able to form sentences of 56 words and use a variety of different types of sentences  by the age of 5 or 6 years old  the majority of children have mastered the basics of their native language  infants  15 month-olds  are initially unable to understand familiar words in their native language pronounced using an unfamiliar accent  this means that a canadian-english speaking infant cannot recognize familiar words pronounced with an australian-english accent  this skill develops close to their second birthdays  however  this can be overcome when a highly familiar story is read in the new accent prior to the test  suggesting the essential functions of underlying spoken language is in place before previously thought 
vocabulary typically grows from about 20 words at 18 months to around 200 words at 21 months  from around 18 months the child starts to combine words into two word sentences  typically the adult expands it to clarify meaning  by 2427 months the child is producing three or four word sentences using a logical  if not strictly correct  syntax  the theory is that children apply a basic set of rules such as adding  s  for plurals or inventing simpler words out of words too complicated to repeat like  choskit  for   following this there is a rapid appearance of grammatical rules and ordering of sentences  there is often an interest in   and imaginative play frequently includes conversations  children s recorded monologues give insight into the development of the process of organizing information into meaningful units 
by three years the child begins to use complex sentences  including relative clauses  although still perfecting various
systems  by five years of age the child s use of language is very similar to that of an adult  from the age of about three children can indicate fantasy or make-believe linguistics  produce coherent personal stories and fictional narrative with beginnings and endings  it is argued that children devise narrative as a way of understanding their own experience and as a medium for communicating their meaning to others  the ability to engage in extended discourse emerges over time from regular conversation with adults and peers  for this the child needs to learn to combine his perspective with that of others and with outside events and learn to use linguistic indicators to show he is doing this  they also learn to adjust their language depending on to whom they are speaking  typically by the age of about 9 a child can recount other narratives in addition to their own experiences  from the perspectives of the author  the characters in the story and their own views

theories  
although the role of adult discourse is important in facilitating the child s learning  there is considerable disagreement among theorists about the extent to which children s early meanings and expressive words arise  findings about the initial mapping of new words  the ability to decontextualize words  and refine meaning of words are diverse  one hypothesis is known as the syntactic
hypothesis which refers to the child s ability to infer meaning from cues  using grammatical information from the structure of sentences  another is the multi-route model in which it is argued that context-bound words and referential words follow different routes  the first being mapped onto event representations and the latter onto mental representations  in this model  parental input has a critical role but the children ultimately rely on cognitive processing to establish subsequent use of words  however  naturalistic research on language development has indicated that preschoolers  vocabularies are strongly associated with the number of words addressed to them by adults 
there is no single accepted theory of language acquisition  instead  there are current theories that help to explain theories of language  theories of cognition  and theories of development  they include the generativist theory    usage-based theory     connectionist theory  and behaviorist theory     generativist theories refer to universal grammar being innate where language experience activates innate knowledge  social interactionist theories define language as a social phenomenon  this theory states that children acquire language because they want to communicate with others  this theory is heavily based on social-cognitive abilities that drive the language acquisition process  usage-based theories define language as a set of formulas that emerge from the childs learning abilities in correspondence with its social cognitive interpretation and understanding of the speakers intended meanings  connectionist theories is a pattern-learning procedure and defines language as a system composed of smaller subsystems or patterns of sound or meaning  behaviorist theories define language as the establishment of   but is now regarded a theory of historical interest 
language  
communication can be defined as the exchange and negotiation of information between two or more individuals through verbal and nonverbal symbols  oral and written  or visual  modes  and the production and comprehension processes of communication  according to first international congress for the study of child language  the general hypothesis  is that  access to social interaction is a prerequisite to normal language acquisition  principles of conversation include two or more people focusing on one topic  all questions in a conversation should be answered  comments should be understood or acknowledged and any form of direction should  in theory  be followed  in the case of young  undeveloped children  these conversations are expected to be basic or redundant  the role of a guardians during developing stages is to convey that conversation is meant to have a purpose  as well as teaching them to recognize the other speakers emotions  communicative language is nonverbal and or verbal  and to achieve communication competence  four components must be met  these four components of communication competence include  grammatical competence  vocabulary knowledge  rules of word sentence formation  etc    sociolinguistic competence  appropriateness of meanings and grammatical forms in different social contexts   discourse competence  knowledge required to combine forms and meanings   and strategic competence  knowledge of verbal and nonverbal communication strategies   the attainment of communicative competence is an essential part of actual communication 
language development is viewed as a motive to communication  and the communicative function of language in-turn provides the motive for language development  jean piaget uses the term acted conversations to explain a childs style of communication that rely more heavily on gestures and body movements  rather than words  younger children depend on gestures for a direct statement of their message  as they begin to acquire more language  body movements take on a different role and begin to complement the verbal message  these nonverbal bodily movements allow children to express their emotions before they can express them verbally  the childs nonverbal communication of how theyre feeling is seen in babies 0 to 3 months who use wild  jerky movements of the body to show excitement or distress  this develops to more rhythmic movements of the entire body at 3 to 5 months to demonstrate the childs anger or delight  between 912 months of age  children view themselves as joining the communicative world  before 912 months  babies interact with objects and interact with people  but they do not interact with people about objects  this developmental change is the change from primary
 capacity to share oneself with others  to secondary intersubjectivity  capacity to share ones experience   which changes the infant from an unsociable to socially engaging creature  around 12 months of age a communicative use of gesture is used  this gesture includes communicative pointing where an infant points to request something  or to point to provide information  another gesture of communication is presented around the age of 10 and 11 months where infants start gaze-following  they look where another person is looking  this
result in changes to their social cognitive skills between the ages of 9 and 15 months as their time is spent increasingly with others  childrens use of non-verbal communicative gestures foretells future language development  the use of non-verbal communication in the form of gestures indicate the childs interest in communication development  and the meanings they choose to convey that are soon revealed through the verbalization of language 
language acquisition and development contribute to the verbal form of communication  children originate with a linguistic system where words they learn  are the words used for functional meaning  this instigation of speech has been termed pragmatic   according to this  children view words as a means of social construction  and that words are used to connect the understanding of communicative intentions of the speaker who speaks a new word  hence  the competence of verbal communication through language is achieved through the attainability of
or   another function of communication through language is pragmatic development  pragmatic development includes the childs intentions of communication before he she knows how to express these intentions  and throughout the first few years of life both language and communicative functions develop 
when children acquire language and learn to use language for communicative functions  pragmatics   children also gain knowledge about the participation in conversations and relating to past experiences events  discourse knowledge   and how to use language appropriately in congruence with their social situation or social group  sociolinguistic knowledge   within the first two years of life  a childs language ability progresses and conversational skills  such as the mechanics of verbal interaction  develop  mechanics of verbal interaction include taking turns  initiating topics  repairing miscommunication  and responding to lengthen or sustain dialogue  conversation is asymmetrical when a child interacts with an adult because the adult is the one to create structure in the conversation  and to build upon the childs contributions  in accordance to the childs developing conversational skills  asymmetrical conversation between adult and child modulate to an equal temperament of conversation  this shift in balance of conversation suggests a narrative discourse development in communication  ordinarily  the development of communicative competence and the development of language are positively correlated with one another  however  the correlation is not flawless 
individual differences  
delays in language is the most frequent type of developmental delay  according to demographics 1 out of 5 children will learn to talk or use words later than other children their age    is three to four times more common in boys than in girls  some children will also display behavioral problems due to their frustration of not being able to express what they want or need 
simple speech delays are usually temporary  most cases are solved on their own or with a little extra attribution from the family  its the parents duty to encourage their baby to talk to them with gestures or sounds and for them to spend a great amount of time playing with  reading to  and communicating with their baby  in certain circumstances  parents will have to seek professional help  such as a  
it is important to take into considerations that sometimes delays can be a warning sign of more serious conditions that could include       developmental delay in other areas  or even an autism spectrum disorder  asd  
environmental causes  
there are many environmental causes that are linked to language delays and they include situations such as  the child is having their full attention on other skills  such as walking perfectly  rather than on language  the child may have a twin or a sibling in which their age are relatively close  and may not be receiving the parents full attention  another circumstance could be a child that is in a daycare that provides few adults to be able to administer individual attention  perhaps the most obvious component would be a child that suffers from psychosocial deprivation such as poverty  malnutrition  poor housing  neglect  inadequate linguistic stimulation  or emotional stress 
neurological causes  
language delay can be caused by a substantial amount of underlying disorders  such as intellectual disability 
takes part for more than 50 percent of language delays  language delay is usually more rigorous than other developmental delays in intellectually disabled children  and it is usually the first obvious symptom of intellectual disability  intellectual disability accounts to global language delay  including delayed auditory comprehension and use of gestures 
impaired hearing is one of the most common causes of language delay  a child who can not hear or process speech in a clear and consistent manner will have a   even the most minimum
or
can considerably affect language development  essentially  the more the severe the impairment  the more serious the language delay  nevertheless 
children that are born to families who use
develop infant babble and use a fully expressive sign language at the same pace as hearing children 
is a developmental reading disorder that occurs when the brain does not properly recognize and process the graphic symbols chosen by society to represent the sounds of speech  children with dyslexia may encounter problems in rhyming and separating sounds that compose words  these abilities are essential in learning to read  early
skills rely heavily on word recognition  when using an
this involves in having the ability to separate out the sounds in words and be able to match them with letter and groups of letters  because they have trouble in connecting sounds of language to the letter of words  this may result difficulty in understanding sentences  they have confusion in mistaking letters such as  b  and  d   for the most part  symptoms of dyslexia may include  difficulty in determining the meaning of a simple sentence  learning to recognize written words  and difficulty in rhyming 
and speech delay are usually correlated  problems with verbal language are the most common signs seen in autism  early diagnosis and treatment of autism can significantly help the child improve their speech skills  autism is recognized as one of the five pervasive developmental disorders  distinguished by problems with language  speech  communication and social skills that present in early childhood  some common autistic syndromes are the following  being limited to no verbal speech 
or repeating words out of context  problems responding to verbal instruction and may ignore others who speak directly 
risk factors  
child development can be negatively influenced by a number of risk factors  many of which have been studied in developing countries  they can be broadly grouped under two headings 
hereditary
environmental factors
1  pre-natal environment
factors related to mothers during pregnancy
nutritional deficiencies
diabetic mother
exposure to radiation
infection with german measles
smoking
use of drugs
factors related to fetus
mal-position in uterus
faulty placental implantation
2  post-natal environment
external environment
socio-economic status of the family
childs nutrition
exposure to radiation
climate and season
childs ordinal position in the family
number of siblings in the family
family structure  single parent or extended family etc  
internal environment
childs intelligence
hormonal influences
emotions
malnutrition  maternal depression and maternal substance abuse are three of these factors which have received particular attention by researchers  however  many more factors have been considered 
postnatal depression  
main article 
although there are a large number of studies contemplating the effect of maternal depression and postnatal depression of various areas of infant development  they are yet to come to consensus regarding the true effects  there are numerous studies indicating impaired development  and equally there are many proclaiming no effect of depression on development  a study of 18-month-olds whose mothers suffered depressive symptoms while they were 6 weeks and or 6 months old indicated that maternal depression had no effect on the childs cognitive development at 18 months  furthermore  the study indicates that maternal depression combined with a poor home environment is more likely to have an effect on cognitive development  however  the authors conclude that it may be that short term depression has no effect  where as long term depression could cause more serious problems  a further longitudinal study spanning 7 years again indicate no effect of maternal depression on cognitive development as a whole  however it found a gender difference in that boys are more susceptible to cognitive developmental issues when their mothers suffer depression  this thread is continued in a study of children up to 2 years old  the study reveals a significant difference on cognitive development between genders  with girls having a higher score  however this pattern is found regardless of the childs mothers history of depression  infants with chronically depressed mothers showed significantly lower scores on the motor and mental scales within the bayley scales of infant development  contrasting with many older studies  a similar effect has been found at 11 years  male children of depressed mothers score an average of 19.4 points lower on an
test than those with healthy mothers  although this difference is much lower in girls  3 month olds with depressed mothers show significantly lower scores on the griffiths mental development scale  which covers a range of developmental areas including cognitive  motor and social development  it has been suggested that interactions between depressed mothers and their children may affect social and cognitive abilities in later life  maternal depression has been shown to influence the mothers interaction with her child  when communicating with their child  depressed mothers fail to make changes to their vocal behaviour  and tend use unstructured vocal behaviours  furthermore  when infants interact with depressed mothers they show signs of stress  such as increased pulse and raised cortisol levels  and make more use of avoidance behaviours  for example looking away  compared to those interacting with healthy mothers  the effect of mother-infant interaction at 2 months has been shown to affect the childs cognitive performance at 5 years  recent studies have begun to identify that other forms of psychopathology that may or may not be co-morbidly occurring with maternal depression can independently influence infants  and toddlers  subsequent social-emotional development through effects on regulatory processes within the child-parent attachment  maternal interpersonal violence-related
 ptsd   for example  has been associated with subsequent dysregulation of emotion and aggression by ages 47 years 
maternal drug abuse  
cocaine  
main article 
research has provided conflicting evidence regarding the effect of maternal substance abuse during and after pregnancy on childrens development  children exposed to cocaine weigh less than those not exposed at numerous ages ranging from 6 to 30 months  furthermore  studies indicate that the head circumference of children exposed to cocaine is lower than those unexposed  on the other hand  two more recent studies found no significant differences between those exposed to cocaine and those who were not in either measure  maternal cocaine use may also affect the childs cognitive development  with exposed children achieving lower scores on measures of psychomotor and mental development  however  again there is conflicting evidence  and a number of studies indicate no effect of maternal cocaine use on their childs cognitive development  motor development can be imapired by maternal cocaine abuse  as is the case for cognitive and physical development  there are also studies showing no effect of cocaine use on motor development 
other  
the use of cocaine by pregnant women is not the only drug that can have a negative effect on the fetus  tobacco  marijuana  and opiates are also the types of drugs that can effect an unborn childs cognitive and behavioral development  smoking tobacco increases pregnancy complications including low birth rate  prematurity  placental abruption  and intrauterine death  it can also cause disturbed maternal-infant interaction  reduced iq  adhd  and it can especially cause tobacco use in the child  parental marijuana exposure may have long-term emotional and behavioral consequences  a ten-year-old child who had been exposed to the drug during pregnancy reported more depressive symptoms than fetuses unexposed  some short-term effects include executive function impairment  reading difficulty  and delayed state regulation  an opiate drug  such as heroin  decreases birth weight  birth length  and head circumference when exposed to the fetus  parental opiate exposure has greater conflicting impact than parental cocaine exposure on the infants central nervous system and autonomic nervous system  there are also some negative consequences on a child that you wouldnt think of with opiates  such as  less rhythmic swallowing  strabismus  and feelings of rejection 
malnutrition  
is a large problem in developing nations  and has an important effect on young childrens weight and height  children suffering malnutrition in colombia weighed less than those living in upper class conditions at the age of 36 months  11.88kg compared to 14kg   similarly  malnourished children were shorter than well-nourished children  again at 36 months  85.3cm in malnourished children  94cm in well-nourished children
malnutrition has been indicated as a negative influence on childhood   although it is now suggested that this effect is nullified when parental iq is considered  implying that this difference is genetic 
nutrients  
the effect of low iron levels on cognitive development and iq is a subject still to reach consensus  some evidence suggests that well-nourished children with lower levels of iron and folate  although not at such a level to be considered deficient  have a lower iq than those with higher levels of iron and folate  furthermore  anaemic children perform worse on cognitive measures than non-anaemic children  these nutrients have been strongly implicated in brain development  along with iodine and zinc  iodine is required for the generation of thyroid hormones necessary for brain development  iodine deficiency may reduce iq by an average of 13.5 points compared to healthy individual  zinc deficiency has also been shown to slow childhood growth and development 
socioeconomic status  
socioeconomic status is measured primarily based on the factors of income  educational attainment and occupation  current investigations into the role of socioeconomic factors on child development repeatedly show that continual poverty is more harmful on   and cognitive abilities than short-lived poverty  children in families who experience persistent financial hardships and poverty have significantly impaired cognitive abilities compared to those in families who do not face this issue  low income poverty can cause a number of further issues shown to effect child development  such as malnutrition and lead poisoning due to lead paint found on the walls of some houses  child blood levels of lead increase as income decreases  income poverty is associated with a 613 point reduction in iq for those earning half of the poverty threshold compared to those earning twice the poverty threshold  that being said  children coming from households featuring continual or temporary poverty still perform lower than children in middle-class families 
parental educational attainment is the most significant socioeconomic factor in predicting the childs cognitive abilities  those with a mother with high iq are likely to have higher iqs themselves  similarly  maternal occupation is associated with better cognitive achievement  those whose mothers job entails problem-solving are more likely to be given stimulating tasks and games  and are likely to achieve more advanced verbal competency 
poverty-stricken children are subjected to fewer stimulating recreational activities  often missing out on trips to libraries or museums  and are unable to access a tutor to help with problematic academic areas 
a further factor in a childs educational attainment involves the school environment  more specifically teacher expectations and attitudes  it has been argued that teachers perceive low-ses children as being less academically able and as such provide them with less attention and reinforcement 
parasites  
diarrhea caused by the parasitic disease giardiasis is associated with lower iq  parasitic worms  helminths  are associated with nutritional deficiencies that are known to be a risk to child development  in particular  intestinal parasitism being one of the most neglected tropical diseases in the developed world  harboring of this parasite could adverse several health implications in children affecting childhood development and morbidity  reducing the prevalence of the parasite can be a benefit in child growth  development  and educational outcome 
poisoning  
high levels of lead in the blood is associated with attention deficits  while
has a negative effect on verbal and full  
due to levels in drinking water is also associated with a reduced iq of 6.2 points between the highest and lowest level of poisoning  prenatal exposure to various
including organophosphates  and
has also been linked to reduced iq score 
have been specifically linked to poorer   verbal comprehension  perceptual reasoning and processing speed 
obesity  
a major problem in childhood is obesity  in america  the number of obese children is rapidly increasing  childhood obesity is caused by a variety of factors  the main causes of childhood obesity are  lifestyle issues-too little activity and too many calories   child obesity can cause major problems with a childs development  in order for a child to develop successfully  he or she must grow up in a positive environment with good health and academics  if a child becomes obese  there will be consequences such as  depression  low self-esteem  eating disorders  medical problems  and so on  these issues of childhood obesity can be slowed  if society focuses on the causes  if parents enforce a healthy lifestyle at home with physical activity and proper dieting  many issues with obesity could be avoided  focusing on the causes may  over time  decrees the consequences of childhood obesity and therefore strengthen a childs development to grow 
other  
cognitive development is related to childhood exposure to violence and trauma  including spousal abuse between the parents and sexual abuse  intrauterine growth retardation is associated with learning deficits in childhood  and as such  is related to lower iq 
neglect  
when a child is unable to meet their developmental goals  because they have not been provided with the correct amount of care  stimulation or nutrition this situation is commonly referred to as  
assessing and identifying  
assessing and identifying neglect pose a number of challenges for practitioners  given that neglect is a dynamic between the child s development and levels of nurturance  the question in identifying neglect  becomes one of where do you start  with the child s development or with the levels of nurturance 
development focused methods  
some professionals identify neglect by measuring the developmental levels of a child  for if those developmental levels are normal  one can  by definition  conclude that a child is not being neglected  areas of development that could be measured include weight  height  stamina  social   emotional responses  speech and motor development  interestingly all these features go up to make a medical assessment of whether a child is thriving  so that a professional looking to start an assessment of neglect  might reasonably start with information collected by a doctor  infants are often weighed and measured when seen by their physicians for   the physician initiates a more complete evaluation when the infant s development and functioning are found to be delayed  what this suggests is that social work staff could consult medical notes to establish if the baby or child is failing to thrive  as a first step in a pathway towards identifying neglect  if developmental levels are subnormal  then the identification of neglect then requires the professional establish if those subnormal levels of development can be put down to the level of nurturance experienced by the child  one needs to discount that the developmental delay was caused by some genetic condition or disease  which do not have their basis in a lack of nurturance 
starting the assessment  
another way of starting a process for identifying neglect is to identify if the child in question is experiencing a level of nurturance lower than that considered necessary to support normal development  in part this requires a knowledge of the level of nurturance required by the child to sustain normal development  which might be particular to his or her age  gender and other factors  however quite how one ascertains what a particular child needs  without referring back to their level of development  is not something theory and policy on neglect is clear about  furthermore  ascertaining whether a child is getting the requisite level of nurturance needs to take into account not just the intensity of the nurturance  but also  given that the intensity of certain forms of nurturance can cary across time  the duration and frequency of the nurturance  it is acceptable for a child to experience varying and low levels of certain types of nurturance across a day and from time to time  however  the levels of nurturance should never cross thresholds of intensity  duration and frequency  for this reason professionals are minded to keep detailed histories of care provision  which demonstrate the duration to which the child is exposed to periods of subnormal exposure to care  stimulation and nutrition 
starting the assessment  
it is most common for guidance to suggest professionals should focus on the levels of nurturance provided by the carers of the child  where neglect is understood as an issue of the parents  behaviour towards the child  some authors feel that establishing the failure of parents and caregivers to provide care would be sufficient to conclude that neglect was occurring  action for children
state that   a child experiences neglect when the adults who look after them fail to meet their needs  clearly defining neglect as a matter of parental performance  this raises the question about what level of nurturance  a carer or parent needs to fall under  to provoke developmental delay  and how one goes about measuring that accurately 
the method  which focuses on the stimulation provided by the carer  can be subject to critique  neglect is about the childs development being adversely affected by the levels of nurturance  but the carers  provision of nurturance is not always a good indicator of the level of nurturance received by the child  neglect may be occurring at school  outside of parental care  the child may be receiving nurturance from siblings or through a boarding school education  which compensates for the lack of nurturance provided by the parents 
linking to stimulation  
neglect is a process whereby children experience developmental delay owing to experiencing insufficient levels of nurturance  it has been argued that in principle  this means that when starting an assessment of neglect by identifying developmental delay one needs to then check the levels of nurturance received by the child  certainly  where guidance on identifying neglect does urge for practitioners to measure developmental levels  some guidance urges practitioners to focus on how developmental levels can be attributed to parental behaviour  however the narrow focus on parental behaviour can be criticised for unnecessarily ruling out the possible effect of institutionalised neglect  e g  neglect at school 
if one starts by concluding that the levels of nurture received by the child are insufficient  one then needs to consider the developmental levels achieved by the child 
further challenges arise however  even when one has established developmental delay and exposure to low levels of nurture  one needs to rule out the possibility that the link between the two is coincidental  the developmental delay may be caused by a genetic disorder  disease or physical  sexual or emotional abuse  of course the developmental delay may be caused by a mixture of underexposure to nurture  abuse  genetics and disease 
practical tools for measuring  
is a practice tool which gives an objective measure of the quality of care in terms of a parent carer s commitment  it was developed in the uk 
the
is a tool which can be used by a practitioner to explore whether neglect is taking place across a range of family functioning areas 
intervention programs for addressing  
early intervention programs and treatments in developed countries include individual counselling  family  group counselling and social support services  behavioural skills training programs to eliminate problematic behaviour and teach parents  appropriate  parenting behaviour 
parenting programs  
is a
through which a  guider  helps a client to enhance communication within relationships  the client is guided to analyse and reflect on video clips of their own interactions  video interaction guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 212  and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan 
is a preventative programme working with parents of children under 6 years old who are at risk of experiencing significant harm through neglect  the programme is delivered in the home by trained practitioners  over 18 to 20 sessions and focuses on 3 key areas  parent-infant child interaction  home safety and child health 
is a positive parenting program  it is a multilevel  parenting and family support strategy  the idea behind it is that if parents are educated on  proper  parenting and given the appropriate resources  it could help decrease the amount of child neglect cases  when deciding whether to leave a child home alone  caregivers need to consider the child s physical  mental  and emotional well-being  as well as state laws and policies regarding this issue 
motivation and inspiration  
a good parenting skill will involve motivating and inspiring children during their upbringing to help them to survive and succeed in life  it is more vital to emphasize on intrinsic motivation than on extrinsic motivation in children
