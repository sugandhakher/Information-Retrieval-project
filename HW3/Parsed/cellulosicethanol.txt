cellulosic ethanol is
 ethyl alcohol  produced from
 the stringy fiber of a plant  rather than from the plant s
or   it is a
produced from       or other plants  the fibrous parts of the plants are mostly inedible to animals  including humans  except for
 grazing  cud-chewing animals such as cows or sheep  
considerable interest in cellulosic ethanol exists because it has the potential for strong economic importance  growth of cellulose by plants is a mechanism that captures and stores
chemically in nontoxic ways with resultant supplies that are easy to transport and store  additionally  transport may be unneeded anyway  because grasses or trees can grow almost anywhere temperate  this is why
is widely viewed as a next level of development for the biofuel industry that could reduce demand for
and even
in ways that -based
alone cannot  potential exists for the many benefits of carbonaceous liquid fuels and
 which today s
depends on  but in a balanced and
way  recycling surface and atmosphere carbon instead of pumping underground carbon up into it and thus adding to it   commercially practical cellulosic alcohol could also avoid one of the problems with today s conventional  grain-based  biofuels  which is that they set up competition for grain with food purposes  potentially driving up the price of food  to date  what stands in the way of these goals is that production of cellulosic alcohol is not yet sufficiently practical on a commercial scale

overview  
cellulosic ethanol is a type of
produced from   a structural material that comprises much of the mass of plants  lignocellulose is composed mainly of  
and    
 switchgrass  
grass species 
and the byproducts of lawn and tree maintenance are some of the more popular cellulosic materials for
production  production of ethanol from lignocellulose has the advantage of abundant and diverse raw material compared to sources such as corn and cane sugars  but requires a greater amount of processing to make the sugar monomers available to the microorganisms typically used to produce ethanol by fermentation 
switchgrass and miscanthus are the major biomass materials being studied today  due to their high productivity per acre  cellulose  however  is contained in nearly every natural  free-growing plant  tree  and bush  in meadows  forests  and fields all over the world without agricultural effort or cost needed to make it grow 
one of the benefits of cellulosic ethanol is it reduces
emissions  ghg  by 85  over reformulated gasoline  by contrast  starch ethanol  e g   from corn   which most frequently uses
to provide energy for the process  may not reduce ghg emissions at all depending on how the starch-based feedstock is produced  according to the
in 2011  there is no commercially viable bio-refinery in existence to convert lignocellulosic biomass to fuel  absence of production of cellulosic ethanol in the quantities required by the regulation was the basis of a
decision announced january 25  2013  voiding a requirement imposed on car and truck fuel producers in the united states by the environmental protection agency requiring addition of cellulosic biofuels to their products  these issues  along with many other difficult production challenges  led
policy researchers to state that  in the short term   cellulosic  ethanol cannot meet the energy security and environmental goals of a gasoline alternative  
history  
the french chemist  henri braconnot  was the first to discover that cellulose could be hydrolyzed into sugars by treatment with sulfuric acid in 1819  the hydrolyzed sugar could then be processed to form ethanol through fermentation  the first commercialized ethanol production began in germany in 1898  where acid was used to hydrolyze cellulose  in the united states  the standard alcohol company opened the first cellulosic ethanol production plant in south carolina in 1910  later  a second plant was opened in louisiana  however  both plants were closed after wwi due to economic reasons 
the first attempt at commercializing a process for ethanol from wood was done in germany in 1898  it involved the use of dilute acid to hydrolyze the cellulose to glucose  and was able to produce 7.6 liters of ethanol per 100kg of wood waste  18usgal  68l  per ton   the germans soon developed an industrial process optimized for yields of around 50 us gallons  190l  per ton of biomass  this process soon found its way to the us  culminating in two commercial plants operating in the southeast during wwi  these plants used what was called  the american process   a one-stage dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis  though the yields were half that of the original german process  25 us gallons  95l  of ethanol per ton versus 50   the throughput of the american process was much higher  a drop in lumber production forced the plants to close shortly after the end of wwi  in the meantime  a small but steady amount of research on dilute acid hydrolysis continued at the  s   during world war ii  the us again turned to cellulosic ethanol  this time for conversion to
to produce synthetic rubber  the vulcan copper and supply company was contracted to construct and operate a plant to convert sawdust into ethanol  the plant was based on modifications to the original german scholler process as developed by the forest products laboratory  this plant achieved an ethanol yield of 50usgal  190l  per dry ton  but was still not profitable and was closed after the war 
with the rapid development of enzyme technologies in the last two decades  the acid hydrolysis process has gradually been replaced by enzymatic hydrolysis  chemical pretreatment of the feedstock is required to prehydrolyze  separate  hemicellulose  so it can be more effectively converted into sugars  the dilute acid pretreatment is developed based on the early work on acid hydrolysis of wood at the  s   recently  the forest products laboratory together with the
developed a sulfite pretreatment to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocellulose for robust enzymatic hydrolysis of wood cellulose 
us president   in his
address delivered january 31  2006  proposed to expand the use of cellulosic ethanol  in his
on january 23  2007  president bush announced a proposed mandate for 35billion us gallons  130,000,000m3  of ethanol by 2017  it is widely recognized that the maximum production of ethanol from corn starch is 15billion us gallons  57,000,000m3  per year  implying a proposed mandate for production of some 20billion us gallons  76,000,000m3  more per year of cellulosic ethanol by 2017  bush s proposed plan includes  2 billion funding  from 2007 to 2017   for cellulosic ethanol plants  with an additional  1.6 billion  from 2007 to 2017   announced by the usda on january 27  2007 
in march 2007  the us government awarded  385 million in grants aimed at jump-starting ethanol production from nontraditional sources like wood chips  switchgrass  and citrus peels  half of the six projects chosen will use thermochemical methods and half will use cellulosic ethanol methods 
the american company
announced in july 2007 that it was awarded a construction permit from the state of georgia to build the first commercial-scale 100-million-us-gallon  380,000m3 -per-year cellulosic ethanol plant in the us  construction began in november  2007  the range fuels plant was built in soperton  ga  but was shut down in january 2011  without ever having produced any ethanol  it had received a  76 million grant from the us department of energy  plus  6 million from the state of georgia  plus an  80 million loan guaranteed by the u s  biorefinery assistance program 
production methods  
for cellulosic ethanol research 
the two ways of producing ethanol from
are 
processes which consist of
on pretreated lignocellulosic materials  using
to break complex cellulose into simple
such as   followed by
and  
that transforms the
raw material into gaseous
and hydrogen  these gases can be converted to ethanol by fermentation or chemical  
as is normal for pure ethanol production  these methods include  
cellulolysis  biological approach   
the stages to produce ethanol using a biological approach are 
a  pretreatment  phase  to make the lignocellulosic material such as wood or straw amenable to hydrolysis
cellulose
 that is    with   to break down the molecules into sugars
separation of the sugar solution from the residual materials  notably
microbial fermentation of the sugar solution
distillation to produce roughly 95  pure alcohol
dehydration by molecular sieves to bring the ethanol concentration to over 99.5 
in 2010  a genetically engineered yeast strain was developed to produce its own cellulose-digesting enzymes  assuming this technology can be scaled to industrial levels  it would eliminate one or more steps of cellulolysis  reducing both the time required and costs of production 
pretreatment  
although lignocellulose is the most abundant plant material resource  its usability is curtailed by its rigid structure  as a result  an effective pretreatment is needed to liberate the cellulose from the lignin seal and its crystalline structure so as to render it accessible for a subsequent hydrolysis step  by far  most pretreatments are done through physical or chemical means  to achieve higher efficiency  both physical and chemical pretreatments are required  physical pretreatment is often called size reduction to reduce biomass physical size  chemical pretreatment is to remove chemical barriers so the enzymes can have access to cellulose for microbial reactions 
to date  the available pretreatment techniques include     ammonia fiber expansion  organosolv    avap  so2-ethanol-water  fractionation  alkaline wet oxidation and ozone pretreatment  besides effective cellulose liberation  an ideal pretreatment has to minimize the formation of degradation products because of their inhibitory effects on subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation processes  the presence of inhibitors will not only further complicate the ethanol production but also increase the cost of production due to entailed detoxification steps  even though pretreatment by acid hydrolysis is probably the oldest and most studied pretreatment technique  it produces several potent inhibitors including
and hydroxymethyl furfural  hmf  which are by far regarded as the most toxic inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate  ammonia fiber expansion  afex  is a promising pretreatment with no inhibitory effect in resulting hydrolysate 
most pretreatment processes are not effective when applied to feedstocks with high lignin content  such as forest biomass    sporl   sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocellulose   and so2-ethanol-water  avap  processes are the three processes that can achieve over 90  cellulose conversion for forest biomass  especially those of softwood species  sporl is the most energy efficient  sugar production per unit energy consumption in pretreatment  and robust process for pretreatment of forest biomass with very low production of fermentation inhibitors  organosolv pulping is particularly effective for hardwoods and offers easy recovery of a hydrophobic lignin product by dilution and precipitation  avap process effectively fractionates all types of lignocellulosics into clean highly digestible cellulose  undegraded hemicellulose sugars  reactive lignin and lignosulfonates  and is characterized by efficient recovery of chemicals 
cellulolytic processes  
the
molecules are composed of long chains of sugar molecules  in the
of cellulose  that is     these chains are broken down to free the sugar before it is fermented for alcohol production 
there are two major cellulose hydrolysis  cellulolysis  processes  a chemical reaction using acids  or an
reaction use  
chemical hydrolysis  
in the traditional methods developed in the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century  hydrolysis is performed by attacking the cellulose with an acid  dilute acid may be used under high heat and high pressure  or more concentrated acid can be used at lower temperatures and atmospheric pressure  a decrystalized cellulosic mixture of acid and sugars reacts in the presence of water to complete individual sugar molecules  hydrolysis   the product from this hydrolysis is then neutralized and yeast fermentation is used to produce ethanol  as mentioned  a significant obstacle to the dilute acid process is that the hydrolysis is so harsh that toxic degradation products are produced that can interfere with fermentation 
uses concentrated acid because it does not produce nearly as many fermentation inhibitors  but must be separated from the sugar stream for recycle  simulated moving bed  smb  chromatographic separation  for example  to be commercially attractive 
scientists found they can access and ferment almost all of the remaining sugars in
straw  the sugars are located in the plants cell walls  which are notoriously difficult to break down  to access these sugars  scientists pretreated the wheat straw with alkaline peroxide  and then used specialized enzymes to break down the cell walls  this method produced 93 us gallons  350l  of ethanol per ton of wheat straw 
enzymatic hydrolysis  
cellulose chains can be broken into
molecules by
 
this reaction occurs at body temperature in the stomachs of
such as cattle and sheep  where the enzymes are produced by microbes  this process uses several enzymes at various stages of this conversion  using a similar enzymatic system  lignocellulosic materials can be enzymatically hydrolyzed at a relatively mild condition  50c and ph 5   thus enabling effective cellulose breakdown without the formation of byproducts that would otherwise inhibit enzyme activity  all major pretreatment methods  including dilute acid  require an enzymatic hydrolysis step to achieve high sugar yield for ethanol fermentation  currently  most pretreatment studies have been laboratory-based  but companies are exploring means to transition from the laboratory to pilot  or production scale 
various enzyme companies have also contributed significant technological breakthroughs in cellulosic ethanol through the mass production of enzymes for hydrolysis at competitive prices 
the
is used by
to secrete  specially engineered enzymes  for an enzymatic
process  their raw material  wood or straw  has to be pre-treated to make it amenable to hydrolysis 
another canadian company  sunopta  uses
pretreatment  providing its technology to verenium  formerly celunol corporation  s facility in   abengoa s facility in   and a china resources alcohol corporation in   the crac production facility uses
as raw material 
and
have received united states department of energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulases  key enzymes in the production of cellulosic ethanol by enzymatic hydrolysis  a recent breakthrough in this regard was the discovery and inclusion of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases  these enzymes are capable of boosting significantly the action of other cellulases by oxidatively attacking a polysaccharide substrate 
other enzyme companies  such as   are developing genetically engineered
which would produce large volumes of  
and
enzymes  which can be used to convert agricultural residues such as corn stover  distiller grains  wheat straw and sugarcane
and
such as
into fermentable sugars which may be used to produce cellulosic ethanol 
in 2010  bp biofuels bought out the cellulosic ethanol venture share of   which had itself been formed by the merger of
and celunol  and with which it jointly owned and operated a 1.4-million-us-gallon  5,300m3  per year demonstration plant in jennings  la  and the laboratory facilities and staff in san diego  ca  bp biofuels continues to operate these facilities  and has begun first phases to construct commercial facilities  ethanol produced in the jennings facility was shipped to london and blended with gasoline to provide fuel for the olympics 
  formerly kl process design group  began commercial operation of a 1.5-million-us-gallon  5,700m3  per year cellulosic ethanol facility in upton  wy in the last quarter of 2007  the western biomass energy facility is currently achieving yields of 4045 us gallons  150170l  per dry ton  it is the first operating commercial cellulosic ethanol facility in the nation  the kl energy process uses a thermomechanical breakdown and enzymatic conversion process  the primary feedstock is soft wood  but lab tests have already proven the kl energy process on wine pomace  sugarcane bagasse  municipal solid waste  and switchgrass 
microbial fermentation  
main article 
traditionally  bakers yeast     has long been used in the brewery industry to produce ethanol from
 six-carbon sugars   due to the complex nature of the
present in   a significant amount of
and
 five-carbon sugars derived from the hemicellulose portion of the lignocellulose  is also present in the hydrolysate  for example  in the hydrolysate of   approximately 30  of the total fermentable sugars is xylose  as a result  the ability of the fermenting microorganisms to use the whole range of sugars available from the hydrolysate is vital to increase the economic competitiveness of cellulosic ethanol and potentially biobased proteins 
in recent years 
for microorganisms used in fuel ethanol production has shown significant progress  besides saccharomyces cerevisiae  microorganisms such as zymomonas mobilis and escherichia coli have been targeted through metabolic engineering for cellulosic ethanol production 
recently  engineered yeasts have been described efficiently fermenting xylose  and arabinose  and even both together  yeast cells are especially attractive for cellulosic ethanol processes because they have been used in biotechnology for hundreds of years  are tolerant to high ethanol and inhibitor concentrations and can grow at low ph values to reduce bacterial contamination 
combined hydrolysis and fermentation  
some species of bacteria have been found capable of direct conversion of a cellulose substrate into ethanol  one example is   which uses a complex
to break down cellulose and synthesize ethanol  however  c thermocellum also produces other products during cellulose metabolism  including
and   in addition to ethanol  lowering the efficiency of the process  some research efforts are directed to optimizing ethanol production by
bacteria that focus on the ethanol-producing pathway 
gasification process  thermochemical approach   
fluidized bed gasifier in
the gasification process does not rely on chemical decomposition of the cellulose chain  cellulolysis   instead of breaking the cellulose into sugar molecules  the carbon in the raw material is converted into   using what amounts to partial combustion  the carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide and hydrogen may then be fed into a special kind of   instead of sugar fermentation with yeast 
uses
bacteria  this microorganism will ingest carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide and hydrogen and produce ethanol and water  the process can thus be broken into three steps 
 complex carbon-based molecules are broken apart to access the carbon as carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide and hydrogen
fermentation  convert the carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide and hydrogen into ethanol using the clostridium ljungdahlii organism
distillation  ethanol is separated from water
a recent study has found another clostridium bacterium that seems to be twice as efficient in making ethanol from carbon monoxide as the one mentioned above 
alternatively  the synthesis gas from gasification may be fed to a catalytic reactor where it is used to produce ethanol and other higher alcohols through a thermochemical process  this process can also generate other types of liquid fuels  an alternative concept successfully demonstrated by the montreal-based company enerkem at their facility in westbury  quebec 
hemicellulose to ethanol  
studies are intensively conducted to develop economic methods to convert both cellulose and
to ethanol  fermentation of glucose  the main product of cellulose hydrolyzate  to ethanol is an already established and efficient technique  however  conversion of xylose  the pentose sugar of hemicellulose hydrolyzate  is a limiting factor  especially in the presence of glucose  moreover  it cannot be disregarded as hemicellulose will increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of cellulosic ethanol production 
sakamoto  2012  et al  show the potential of genetic engineering microbes to express hemicellulase enzymes  the researchers created a recombinant saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that was able to 
hydrolyze hemicellulase through codisplaying endoxylanase on its cell surface 
assimilate xylose by expression of xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase 
the strain was able to convert rice straw hydrolyzate to ethanol  which contains hemicellulosic components  moreover  it was able to produce 2.5x more ethanol than the control strain  showing the highly effective process of cell surface-engineering to produce ethanol 
economics  
the shift to a renewable fuel resource has been a target for many years now  however  most of its production is with the use of corn ethanol  in the year 2000  there was only 6.2 billion liters produced in the united states and it has expanded over 800  to 50 billion litres in just a decade  2010   government pressures to shift to renewable fuel resources has been apparent since the u s environmental protection agency has implemented the 2007 renewable fuel standard  rfs  to use a percentage of renewable fuel in products or face penalties  the shift to cellulosic ethanol production instead of corn has been strongly promoted by the us government  even with these policies in place and the government attempting to create a market for cellulose ethanol  there was no commercial production of this fuel in 2010 and 2011  the energy independence and security act originally set goals of 100 million  250 million and 500 million gallons for the years 2010  2011 and 2012 respectively  however  as of 2012 it was projected that the production of cellulosic ethanol would be approximately 10.5 million far from its target  in 2007 alone  the us government provided 1 billion us dollars for cellulosic ethanol projects  while china invested 500 million us dollars into cellulosic ethanol research 
due to the lack of existing commercialized plant data  it is difficult to determine the exact method of production that will be most commonly employed  model systems try to compare different technologies costs  however these models cannot be applied to commercial-plant costs  currently  there are many pilot and demonstration facilities open that show cellulosic production on a smaller scale  these main facilities are summarized in the  
start-up costs for pilot scale lignocellulosic ethanol plants are high  on 28 february 2007  the
announced  385 million in grant funding to six cellulosic ethanol plants  this grant funding accounts for 40  of the investment costs  the remaining 60  comes from the promoters of those facilities  hence  a total of  1billion will be invested for approximately 140-million-us-gallon  530,000m3  capacity  this translates into  7 annual gallon production capacity in capital investment costs for pilot plants  future capital costs are expected to be lower 
plants cost roughly  13 annual gallon capacity  though the cost of the corn itself is considerably greater than for
or waste biomass 
as of 2007  ethanol is produced mostly from sugars or starches  obtained from fruits and grains  in contrast  cellulosic ethanol is obtained from cellulose  the main component of wood  straw  and much of the structure of plants  since cellulose cannot be digested by humans  the production of cellulose does not compete with the production of food  other than conversion of land from food production to cellulose production  which has recently started to become an issue  due to rising wheat prices   the price per ton of the raw material is thus much cheaper than that of grains or fruits  moreover  since cellulose is the main component of plants  the whole plant can be harvested  this results in much better yieldsup to 10 short tons per acre  22t ha   instead of 4-5 short tons acre  911t ha  for the best crops of grain   
the raw material is plentiful  an estimated 323 million tons of cellulose-containing raw materials which could be used to create ethanol are thrown away each year in us alone  this includes 36.8 million dry tons of urban wood wastes  90.5 million dry tons of primary mill residues  45 million dry tons of forest residues  and 150.7million dry tons of corn stover and wheat straw  transforming them into ethanol using efficient and cost-effective hemi cellulase  enzymes or other processes might provide as much as 30  of the current fuel consumption in the united states    moreover  even land marginal for agriculture could be planted with cellulose-producing crops  such as switchgrass  resulting in enough production to substitute for all the current oil imports into the united states 
paper  cardboard  and packaging comprise a substantial part of the solid waste sent to
in the united states each day  41.26  of all organic
 msw  according to  s city profiles    these city profiles account for accumulation of 612.3 short tons  555.5t  daily per landfill where an average population density of 2,413 per square mile persists  all these  except gypsum board  contain cellulose  which is transformable into cellulosic ethanol  this may have additional environmental benefits because decomposition of these products produces   a potent greenhouse gas 
reduction of the disposal of solid waste through cellulosic ethanol conversion would reduce solid waste disposal costs by local and state governments  it is estimated that each person in the us throws away 4.4lb  2.0kg  of trash each day  of which 37  contains waste paper  which is largely cellulose  that computes to 244thousand tons per day of discarded waste paper that contains cellulose  the raw material to produce cellulosic ethanol is not only free  it has a negative costi e   ethanol producers can get paid to take it away 
in june 2006  a u s  senate hearing was told the current cost of producing cellulosic ethanol is us  2.25 per us gallon  us  0.59 litre   primarily due to the current poor conversion efficiency    at that price  it would cost about  120 to substitute a barrel of oil  42 us gallons  160l    taking into account the lower energy content of   however  the department of energy is optimistic and has requested a doubling of research funding  the same senate hearing was told the research target was to reduce the cost of production to us  1.07 per us gallon  us  0.28 litre  by 2012   the production of cellulosic ethanol represents not only a step toward true energy diversity for the country  but a very cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels  it is advanced weaponry in the war on oil   said   managing partner of   who recently told a reuters global biofuels summit that he could see cellulosic fuel prices sinking to  1per gallon within ten years 
in september 2010  a report by
analyzed the
biomass infrastructure and future refinery development  estimated prices for a litre of ethanol in august 2010 are eur 0.51 for 1g and 0.71 for 2g    the report suggested europe should copy the current us subsidies of up to  50 per dry tonne 
recently on october 25  2012  bp  one of the leaders in fuel products  announced the cancellation of their proposed  350 million commercial-scale plant  it was estimated that the plant would be producing 36 million gallons a year at its location in highlands county of florida  bp has still provided 500 million us dollars for biofuel research at the energy biosciences institute  general motors  gm  has also invested into cellulosic companies more specifically mascoma and coskata  there are many other companies in construction or heading towards it  abengoa
is building a 25 million-gallon per year plant in   technology platform based on the fungus
to convert lignocellulose into fermentable sugars  poet is also in midst of producing a 200 million dollar  25-million-gallon per year in emmetsburg  iowa  mascoma now partnered with valero has declared their intention to build a 20 million gallon per year in kinross  michigan  china alcohol resource corporation has developed a 6.4 million liter cellulosic ethanol plant under continuous operation 
also  since 2013  the brazilian company granbio is working to become a producer of biofuels and biochemicals  the family-held company is commissioning a 82 million liters per year  22 mmgy  cellulosic ethanol plant  2g ethanol  in the state of alagoas  brazil  which will be the first industrial facility of the group  granbio s second generation ethanol facility is integrated to a first generation ethanol plant operated by grupo carlos lyra  uses process technology from beta renewables  enzymes from novozymes and yeast from dsm  breaking ground in january 2013  the plant is in final commissioning  according to granbio annual financial records  the total investment was 208 million us dollars 
enzyme-cost barrier  
cellulases and hemicellulases used in the production of cellulosic ethanol are more expensive compared to their first generation counterparts  enzymes required for maize grain ethanol production cost 2.64-5.28 us dollars per cubic meter of ethanol produced  enzymes for cellulosic ethanol production are projected to cost 79.25 us dollars  meaning they are 20-40 times more expensive  the cost differences are attributed to quantity required  the cellulase family of enzymes have a one to two order smaller magnitude of efficiency  therefore  it requires 40 to 100 times more of the enzyme to be present in its production  for each ton of biomass it requires 15-25 kilograms of enzyme  more recent estimates are lower  suggesting 1kg of enzyme per dry tonne of biomass feedstock  there is also relatively high capital costs associated with the long incubation times for the vessel that perform enzymatic hydrolysis  altogether  enzymes comprise a significant portion of 20-40  for cellulosic ethanol production  a recent paper estimates the range at 13-36  of cash costs  with a key factor being how the cellulase enzyme is produced  for cellulase produced offsite  enzyme production amounts to 36  of cash cost  for enzyme produced onsite in a separate plant  the fraction is 29   for integrated enzyme production  the faction is 13   one of the key benefits of integrated production is that biomass instead of glucose is the enzyme growth medium  biomass costs less  and it makes the resulting cellulosic ethanol a 100  second-generation biofuel  i e   it uses no food for fuel 
feedstocks  
in general there are two types of feedstocks  forest  woody  biomass and agricultural biomass  in the us  about 1.4 billion dry tons of biomass can be sustainably produced annually  about 370 million tons or 30  are forest biomass  forest biomass has higher cellulose and lignin content and lower hemicellulose and ash content than agricultural biomass  because of the difficulties and low ethanol yield in fermenting pretreatment hydrolysate  especially those with very high 5 carbon hemicellulose sugars such as xylose  forest biomass has significant advantages over agricultural biomass  forest biomass also has high density which significantly reduces transportation cost  it can be harvested year around which eliminates long term storage  the close to zero ash content of forest biomass significantly reduces dead load in transportation and processing  to meet the needs for biodiversity  forest biomass will be an important biomass feedstock supply mix in the future biobased economy  however  forest biomass is much more recalcitrant than agricultural biomass  recently  the
together with the
developed efficient technologies that can overcome the strong recalcitrance of forest  woody  biomass including those of softwood species that have low xylan content  short-rotation intensive culture or tree farming can offer an almost unlimited opportunity for forest biomass production 
from slashes and tree tops and
from saw mills  and
are common forest biomass feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production 
the following are a few examples of agricultural biomass 
switchgrass    is a native
grass  known for its hardiness and rapid growth  this perennial grows during the warm months to heights of 26feet  switchgrass can be grown in most parts of the united states  including swamplands  plains  streams  and along the shores   interstate highways  it is self-seeding  no tractor for sowing  only for mowing   resistant to many diseases and pests    can produce high yields with low applications of fertilizer and other chemicals  it is also tolerant to poor soils  flooding    drought  improves soil quality and prevents erosion due its type of root system 
switchgrass is an approved cover crop for land protected under the federal
 crp   crp is a government program that pays producers a fee for not growing crops on land on which crops recently grew  this program reduces soil erosion  enhances water quality  and increases wildlife habitat  crp land serves as a habitat for upland game  such as pheasants and ducks  and a number of insects  switchgrass for biofuel production has been considered for use on conservation reserve program  crp  land  which could increase ecological sustainability and lower the cost of the crp program  however  crp rules would have to be modified to allow this economic use of the crp land 
miscanthus  giganteus is another viable feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production  this species of grass is native to asia and is the sterile triploid hybrid of
and   it can grow up to 12 feet  3.7m  tall with little water or fertilizer input  miscanthus is similar to switchgrass with respect to cold and drought tolerance and water use efficiency  miscanthus is commercially grown in the european union as a combustible energy source 
corn cobs and corn stover are the most popular agricultural biomass 
it has been suggested that
may become a valuable source of biomass 
environmental effects  
the environmental impact from the production of fuels is an important factor in determining its feasibility as an alternative to fossil fuels  over the long run  small differences in production cost  environmental ramifications  and energy output may have large effects  it has been found that cellulosic ethanol can produce a positive net energy output  the reduction in green house gas  ghg  emissions from corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol compared with fossil fuels is drastic  corn ethanol may reduce overall ghg emissions by about 13   while that figure is around 88  or greater for cellulosic ethanol  as well  cellulosic ethanol can reduce carbon dioxide emissions to nearly zero 
croplands  
a major concern for the viability of current alternative fuels is the cropland needed to produce the required materials  for example  the production of corn for corn ethanol fuel competes with cropland that may be used for food growth and other feedstocks  the difference between this and cellulosic ethanol production is that cellulosic material is widely available and is derived from a large resource of things  some crops used for cellulosic ethanol production include switchgrass  corn stover  and hybrid poplar  these crops are fast-growing and can be grown on many types of land which makes them more versatile  cellulosic ethanol can also be made from wood residues  chips and sawdust   municipal solid waste such as trash or garbage  paper and sewage sludge  cereal straws and grasses  it is particularly the non-edible portions of plant material which are used to make cellulosic ethanol  which also minimizes the potential cost of using food products in production 
the effectiveness of growing crops for the purpose of biomass can vary tremendously depending on the geographical location of the plot  for example  factors such as precipitation and sunlight exposure may greatly effect the energy input required to maintain the crops  and therefore effect the overall energy output  a study done over five years showed that growing and managing switchgrass exclusively as a biomass energy crop can produce 500  or more renewable energy than is consumed during production  the levels of ghg emissions and carbon dioxide were also drastically decreased from using cellulosic ethanol compared with traditional gasoline

notes  calculated using default assumptions for 2015 scenario for ethanol in  
gasoline is a combination of conventional and  
in 2008  there was only a small amount of switchgrass dedicated for ethanol production  in order for it to be grown on a large-scale production it must compete with existing uses of agricultural land  mainly for the production of crop commodities  of the united states  2.26billion acres  9.1million km2  of unsubmerged land  33  are forestland  26  pastureland and grassland  and 20  crop land  a study done by the u s  departments of energy and agriculture in 2005 determined whether there were enough available land resources to sustain production of over 1billion dry tons of biomass annually to replace 30  or more of the nations current use of liquid transportation fuels  the study found that there could be 1.3billion dry tons of biomass available for ethanol use  by making little changes in agricultural and forestry practices and meeting the demands for forestry products  food  and fiber  a recent study done by the university of tennessee reported that as many as 100million acres  400,000km2  or 154,000sqmi  of cropland and pasture will need to be allocated to switchgrass production in order to offset petroleum use by 25percent

currently  corn is easier and less expensive to process into ethanol in comparison to cellulosic ethanol  the department of energy estimates that it costs about  2.20 per gallon to produce cellulosic ethanol  which is twice as much as ethanol from corn  enzymes that destroy plant cell wall tissue cost 30 to 50cents per gallon of ethanol compared to 3cents per gallon for corn    the department of energy hopes to reduce production cost to  1.07 per gallon by 2012 to be effective  however  cellulosic biomass is cheaper to produce than corn  because it requires fewer inputs  such as energy  fertilizer  herbicide  and is accompanied by less soil erosion and improved soil fertility  additionally  nonfermentable and unconverted solids left after making ethanol can be burned to provide the fuel needed to operate the conversion plant and produce electricity  energy used to run corn-based ethanol plants is derived from coal and natural gas  the
estimates the cost of cellulosic ethanol from the first generation of commercial plants will be in the  1.90 2.25 per gallon range  excluding incentives  this compares to the current cost of  1.20 1.50 per gallon for ethanol from corn and the current retail price of over  4.00 per gallon for regular gasoline  which is subsidized and taxed  
one of the major reasons for increasing the use of biofuels is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  in comparison to gasoline  ethanol burns cleaner  thus putting less carbon dioxide and overall pollution in the air    additionally  only low levels of smog are produced from combustion  according to the u s  department of energy  ethanol from cellulose reduces greenhouse gas emission by 86percent when compared to gasoline and to corn-based ethanol  which decreases emissions by 52percent  carbon dioxide gas emissions are shown to be 85 lower than those from gasoline  cellulosic ethanol contributes little to the greenhouse effect and has a five times better net energy balance than corn-based ethanol  when used as a fuel  cellulosic ethanol releases less sulfur  carbon monoxide  particulates  and greenhouse gases  cellulosic ethanol should earn producers carbon reduction credits  higher than those given to producers who grow corn for ethanol  which is about 3 to 20cents per gallon 
it takes 0.76 j of energy from fossil fuels to produce 1 j worth of ethanol from corn  this total includes the use of fossil fuels used for fertilizer  tractor fuel  ethanol plant operation  etc  research has shown that fossil fuel can produce over five times the volume of ethanol from prairie grasses  according to terry riley  president of policy at the theodore roosevelt conservation partnership  the united states department of energy concludes that corn-based ethanol provides 26percent more energy than it requires for production  while cellulosic ethanol provides 80percent more energy  cellulosic ethanol yields 80 percent more energy than is required to grow and convert it  the process of turning corn into ethanol requires about 1700 times  by volume  as much water as ethanol produced      additionally  it leaves 12 times its volume in waste  grain ethanol uses only the edible portion of the plant

cellulose is not used for food and can be grown in all parts of the world  the entire plant can be used when producing cellulosic ethanol  switchgrass yields twice as much ethanol per acre than corn  therefore  less land is needed for production and thus less habitat fragmentation  biomass materials require fewer inputs  such as fertilizer  herbicides  and other chemicals that can pose risks to wildlife  their extensive roots improve soil quality  reduce erosion  and increase nutrient capture  herbaceous energy crops reduce soil erosion by greater than 90   when compared to conventional commodity crop production  this can translate into improved water quality for rural communities  additionally  herbaceous energy crops add organic material to depleted soils and can increase soil carbon  which can have a direct effect on climate change  as soil carbon can absorb carbon dioxide in the air  as compared to commodity crop production  biomass reduces surface runoff and nitrogen transport  switchgrass provides an environment for diverse wildlife habitation  mainly insects and ground birds  conservation reserve program  crp  land is composed of perennial grasses  which are used for cellulosic ethanol  and may be available for use 
for years american farmers have practiced row cropping  with crops such as sorghum and corn  because of this  much is known about the effect of these practices on wildlife  the most significant effect of increased corn ethanol would be the additional land that would have to be converted to agricultural use and the increased erosion and fertilizer use that goes along with agricultural production  increasing our ethanol production through the use of corn could produce negative effects on wildlife  the magnitude of which will depend on the scale of production and whether the land used for this increased production was formerly idle  in a natural state  or planted with other row crops  another consideration is whether to plant a switchgrass monoculture or use a variety of grasses and other vegetation  while a mixture of vegetation types likely would provide better wildlife habitat  the technology has not yet developed to allow the processing of a mixture of different grass species or vegetation types into bioethanol  of course  cellulosic ethanol production is still in its infancy  and the possibility of using diverse vegetation stands instead of monocultures deserves further exploration as research continues 
a study by nobel prize winner
found ethanol produced from corn had a  net climate warming  effect when compared to oil when the full
properly considers the
 n20  emissions that occur during
production  crutzen found that crops with less
demand  such as grasses and woody coppice species  have more favourable climate impacts 
cellulosic ethanol commercialization  
main article 
cellulosic ethanol commercialization is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel  companies such as     and
are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol  while companies such as       and
are producing enzymes which could enable a cellulosic ethanol future  the shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players  from farmers to biotechnology firms  and from project developers to investors 
the cellulosic ethanol industry developed some new commercial-scale plants in 2008  in the united states  plants totaling 12 million liters  3.17 million gal  per year were operational  and an additional 80 million liters  21.1 million gal   per year of capacity - in 26 new plants - was under construction  in canada  capacity of 6 million liters per year was operational  in europe  several plants were operational in germany  spain  and sweden  and capacity of 10 million liters per year was under construction 
italy-based
broke ground for its 13 mmgy cellulosic ethanol facility in northwestern italy on april 12  2011  the project will be the largest cellulosic ethanol project in the world  10 times larger than any of the currently operating demonstration-scale facilities
