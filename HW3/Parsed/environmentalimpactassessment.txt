environmental assessment  ea  is the term used for the assessment of the
 positive and negative  of a plan  policy  program  or concrete projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action  in this context  the term  environmental impact assessment   eia  is usually used when applied to concrete projects by individuals or companies and the term  strategic environmental assessment   sea  applies to policies  plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state  fischer  2016   environmental assessments may be governed by rules of
regarding public participation and documentation of decision making  and may be subject to judicial review 
the purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project  the international association for impact assessment  iaia  defines an environmental impact assessment as  the process of identifying  predicting  evaluating and mitigating the   social  and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made   eias are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome  but rather they require decision makers to account for environmental values in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts 
casi global  new york    the global certification body for csr     sustainability goes one step further in this definition to include financial and supply chain effects  any effects of the projects supply chain on the environment  ecology  human resources or country resources are to be included in the impact analysis  most global fellows of casi ny have to write a paper on the same and are authorized to undertake such projects in their country 
engineering and consulting companies work hand in hand as
for   energy  oil   gas companies executing eias  companies operating globally such as         schlumberger water services  a
company  
are an example of a much bigger pool of expertise globally  these contractors are the ones not only in charge of preparing an eia study but most importantly getting these studies approved by each country government offices prior to the execution of a project  each country will also have its own local contractors offering the same kind of service hence breaking out monopolies by increasing the supply of eias execution consultants

history  
environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s  as part of increasing   eias involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making  in the united states  environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969  with enactment of the   eias have been used increasingly around the world  the number of  environmental assessments  filed every year  has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous
 eis    an environmental assessment is a  mini-eis designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown environmental impact statement  eis  is necessary   eia is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur 
methods  
general and industry specific assessment methods are available including 
industrial products - product environmental
 lca  is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment  these eias consider activities related to extraction of raw materials  ancillary materials  equipment  production  use  disposal and ancillary equipment 
genetically modified plants - specific methods available to perform eias of
include gmp-ram and inova 
- eia methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators  however  many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified  e g  landscape quality  lifestyle quality and social acceptance  instead information from similar eias  expert judgment and community sentiment are employed  approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used  a fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposed
and implemented using a software tool  tdeia  
follow-up  
at the end of the project  an audit evaluates the accuracy of the eia by comparing actual to predicted impacts  the objective is to make future eias more valid and effective  two primary considerations are 
scientific - to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors
management - to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts
audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the
or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the eia document 
after an eia  the
and
may be applied to decide whether to reject  modify or require
or
coverage to a project  based on predicted harms

australia  
the history of eia in australia could be linked to the enactment of the
 nepa  in 1970  which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement  in australia  one might say that the eia procedures were introduced at a state level prior to that of the commonwealth  federal   with a majority of the states having divergent views to the commonwealth  one of the pioneering states was new south wales  whose state pollution control commission issued eia guidelines in 1974  at a commonwealth  federal  level  this was followed by passing of the environment protection  impact of proposals  act in 1974  the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999  epbc  superseded the environment protection  impact of proposals  act 1974 and is the current central piece for eia in australia on a commonwealth  federal  level  an important point to note is that this commonwealth act does not affect the validity of the states and territories environmental and development assessments and approvals  rather the epbc runs as a parallel to the state territory systems  overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one off accreditation of state processes  as provided for in the epbc act 
the commonwealth level  
the epbc act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora  fauna  ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the epbc act as matters of national environmental significance  following are the eight matters of national environmental significance to which the epbc act applies 
world heritage sites
national heritage places
ramsar wetlands of international significance
listed threatened species and ecological communities
migratory species protected under international agreements
the commonwealth marine environment
nuclear actions  including uranium mining 
national heritage 
in addition to this  the epbc act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities  these activities could be by the commonwealth  or its agents  anywhere in the world or activities on commonwealth land  and activities that are listed as having a significant impact on matters of national environment significance  
the epbc act comes into play when a person  a proponent   wants an action  often called a proposal or project  assessed for environmental impacts under the epbc act  he or she must refer the project to the department of environment  water  heritage and the arts  australia   this referral is then released to the public  as well as relevant state  territory and commonwealth ministers  for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance  the department of environment  water  heritage and the arts assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility  the final discretion on the decision remains of the minister  which is not solely based on matters of national environmental significance but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project 
the australian government environment minister cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of national environmental significance despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts  this is primarily due to the division of powers between the states and the federal government and due to which the australian government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision 
there are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of epbc act  depending on the kind of breach  civil penalty  maximum  may go up to  550,000 for an individual and  5.5 million for a body corporate  or for criminal penalty  maximum  of seven years imprisonment and or penalty of  46,200 
the state and territory level  
australian capital territory  act   
eia provisions within ministerial authorities in the act are found in the chapters 7 and 8 of the planning and development act 2007  act   eia in act was previously administered with the help of part 4 of the land  planning and environment  act 1991  land act  and territory plan  plan for land-use   note that some eia may occur in the act on commonwealth land under the epbc act  cth   further provisions of the australian capital territory  planning and land management  act 1988  cth  may also be applicable particularly to national land and  designated areas  
new south wales  nsw   
in new south wales  the environment planning assessment act 1979  epa  establishes three pathways for eia  the first is under part 5.1 of the epaa  which provides for eia of  state significant infrastructure  projects   from june 2011  this part replaced part 3a  which previously covered eia of major projects   the second is under part 4 of the act dealing with development control  if a project does not require approval under part 3a or part 4 it is then potentially captured by the third pathway  part 5 dealing with environment impact assessment 
northern territory  nt   
the eia process in northern territory is chiefly administered under the environmental assessment act  eaa   although eaa is the primary tool for eia in northern territory  there are further provisions for proposals in the inquiries act 1985  nt  
queensland  qld   
there are four main eia processes in queensland  firstly  under the integrated planning act 1997  ipa  for development projects other than mining  secondly  under the environmental protection act 1994  ep act  for some mining and petroleum activities  thirdly  under the state development and public works organization act 1971  state development act  for significant projects  finally  environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999  cth  for controlled actions 
south australia  sa

canada  
in friends of the oldman river society v  canada  minister of transportation    
of the
described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters 
 environmental impact assessment is  in its simplest form  a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making  
cited      the basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated   1  early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking   2  decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles  to the greatest extent possible  the proponents development desires with environmental protection and preservation  
la forest referred to    1.2,1.4  and    p 5  who described     environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component  that provide     an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development  
justice la forest addressed his concerns about the implications of bill c-45 regarding public navigation rights on lakes and rivers that would contradict previous cases   
the
 ceaa 2012   and its regulations establish the legislative basis for the federal practice of environmental assessment in most regions of canada   ceaa 2012 came into force july 6  2012 and replaces the former canadian environmental assessment act  1995   ea is defined as a planning tool to identify  understand  assess and mitigate  where possible  the environmental effects of a project 
 the purposes of this act are   a  to protect the components of the environment that are within the legislative authority of parliament from significant adverse environmental effects caused by a designated project   b  to ensure that designated projects that require the exercise of a power or performance of a duty or function by a federal authority under any act of parliament other than this act to be carried out  are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects   c  to promote cooperation and coordinated action between federal and provincial governments with respect to environmental assessments   d  to promote communication and cooperation with aboriginal peoples with respect to environmental assessments   e  to ensure that opportunities are provided for meaningful public participation during an environmental assessment   f  to ensure that an environmental assessment is completed in a timely manner   g  to ensure that projects  as defined in section 66  that are to be carried out on federal lands  or those that are outside canada and that are to be carried out or financially supported by a federal authority  are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects   h  to encourage federal authorities to take actions that promote sustainable development in order to achieve or maintain a healthy environment and a healthy economy  and  i  to encourage the study of the cumulative effects of physical activities in a region and the consideration of those study results in environmental assessments  
opposition  
environmental lawyer dianne saxe argued that the ceaa 2012  allows the federal government to create mandatory timelines for assessments of even the largest and most important projects  regardless of public opposition     
 now that federal environmental assessments are gone  the federal government will only assess very large  very important projects  but its going to do them in a hurry  
dianne saxe
on 3 august 2012 the canadian environmental assessment agency nine  designated projects  with their timelines  enbridge northern gateway pipeline joint review panel  jrp  18 months  marathon platinum group metals and copper mine project  jrp   13 months  site c clean energy project  jrp  8.5 months  deep geologic repository project  jrp  17 months  enbridge northern gateway project  jrp  18 months  jackpine mine expansion project  jrp  11.5 months  pierre river mine project  8 months  new prosperity gold-copper mine project  jrp  7.5 months  frontier oil sands mine project  jrp 8.5 months  encana cenovus shallow gas infill project  jrp  5 months

issued a statement claiming that the federal government s recent changes to  fish habitat protection  the
and the canadian environmental assessment act   along with gutting existing laws and making cuts to science and research   will be disastrous  not only for the environment  but also for canadians health and economic prosperity   on 26 september 2012  leslie argued that with the changes to the canadian environmental assessment act that came into effect 6 july 2012   seismic testing  dams  wind farms and power plants  no longer required any federal environmental assessment  she also claimed that because the ceaa 2012which she claimed was rushed through parliamentdismantled the ceaa 1995  the oshawa ethanol plant project would no longer have a full federal environmental assessment  mr  peter kent  minister of the environment  explained that the ceaa 2012  provides for the government of canada and the environmental assessment agency to focus on the large and most significant projects that are being proposed across the country   the 2,000 to 3,000-plus smaller screenings that were in effect under ceaa 1995 became the  responsibility of lower levels of government but are still subject to the same strict federal environmental laws   anne minh-thu quach  mp for beauharnoissalaberry  qc  argued that the mammoth budget bill dismantled 50 years of environmental protection without consulting canadians about the  colossal changes they are making to environmental assessments   she claimed that the federal government is entering into  limited consultations  by invitation only  months after the damage was done  
china  
the environmental impact assessment law  eia law  requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction  however  if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement  the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau  epb  may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment  if the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time  only then is the epb authorized to fine the developer  even so  the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about us 25,000  a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects  the lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction 
china s
 sepa  used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004  including three hydro-power plants under the
project company  although one month later  note as a point of reference  that the typical eia for a major project in the usa takes one to two years    most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction  reportedly having passed the environmental assessment  the fact that these key projects  construction was ever suspended was notable 
a joint investigation by sepa and the ministry of land and resources in 2004 showed that 30-40  of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required  while in some areas only 6-7  did so  this partly explains why china has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years 
sepa alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations  observed professor   director of the centre to help environmental victims at   in fact  according to wang  the rate of china s environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10  
egypt  
environmental impact assessment  eia  eia is implemented in egypt under the umbrella of the ministry of state for environmental affairs  the egyptian environmental affairs agency  eeaa  is responsible for the eia services 
in june 1997  the responsibility of egypt s first full-time minister of state for environmental affairs was assigned as stated in the presidential decree no 275/1997  from thereon  the new ministry has focused  in close collaboration with the national and international development partners  on defining environmental policies  setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development 
according to the law 4/1994 for the protection of the environment  the egyptian environmental affairs agency  eeaa  was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982  at the central level  eeaa represents the executive arm of the ministry 
the purpose of eia is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development  the long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs  eia is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach 
eia must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the law for the environment 
eu  
there is a wide range of instruments in the   among them the
has established a mix of mandatory and discretionary procedures to assess environmental impacts 
 85/337 eec  on environmental impact assessments  known as the eia directive 
was first introduced in 1985 and was amended in 1997  the directive was amended again in 2003  following eu signature of the 1998   and once more in 2009  the initial directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in directive 2011/92 eu of 13 december 2011  in 2001  the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called
directive  2001/42 ec   which is now in force  under the eu directive  an eia must provide certain information to comply  there are seven key areas that are required 
description of the project
description of actual project and site description
break the project down into its key components  i e  construction  operations  decommissioning
for each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance
for each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed  e g     noise 
alternatives that have been considered
examine alternatives that have been considered
example  in a
power station  will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally 
description of the environment
list of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development
example  populations    flora  air  soil  water  humans  landscape  cultural heritage
this section is best carried out with the help of local experts  e g  the
in the uk
description of the significant effects on the environment
the word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary
 significant  must be defined
the most frequent method used here is use of the
the matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions
example  in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds
mitigation
this is where eia is most useful
once section 4 is complete  it is obvious where impacts are greatest
using this information ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed
best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best
using the windfarm example again construction could be out of bird nesting seasons
non-technical summary  eis 
the eia is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process
it is important that the information is available to the public
this section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams
it should be understood by the informed lay-person
lack of know-how technical difficulties
this section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge
it can be used to focus areas of future research
some developers see the eia as a starting block for poor environmental management
annexed projects  
all projects are either classified as annex 1 or annex 2 projects  those lying in annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways  chemical works  bridges  powerstations etc  these always require an eia under the environmental impact assessment directive  85,337 eec as amended   annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in annex 1  member states must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in annex 3 of codified directive 2011/92 eu 
the netherlands  
eia was implemented in dutch legislation on september 1  1987  the categories of projects that require an eia are summarised in dutch legislation  the wet milieubeheer  the use of thresholds for activities makes sure that eia is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment 
for projects and plans that fit these criteria  an eia report is required  the eia report defines a o  the proposed initiative  it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact 
hong kong  
eia in hong kong  since 1998  is regulated by the environmental impact assessment ordinance 1997 
the original proposal to construct the
overground across the
failed to get through eia  and the
had to change its plan and build the railway underground  in april 2011  the eia of the hong kong section of the
was found to have breached the ordinance  and was declared unlawful  the appeal by the government was allowed in september 2011  however  it was estimated that this eia court case had increased the construction cost of the hong kong section of the bridge by hk 6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices 
india  
the
 moefcc  of india has been in a great effort in environmental impact assessment in india  the main laws in action are the water act 1974   the indian   the air  prevention and control of pollution  act  1981  and the environment  protection  act  1986  biological diversity act 2002   the responsible body for this is the central pollution control board  environmental impact assessment  eia  studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data  primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment  like air quality data  water quality data etc    secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area  the environmental impact assessment  eia  studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends  based on a few months of primary data  has limitations  ideally  the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area  in many eia studies  the secondary data needs could be as high as 80  of the total data requirement  eic is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in india 
the environmental impact assessment  eia  experience in india indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of eia  the environment being a multi-disciplinary subject  a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data  however  no single organization in india tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners  further  environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the eia  this makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators  with this background  the environmental information centre  eic  has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by moef  project proponents  consultants  ngos and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in india  eic caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country 
eic stores data in gis format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to eia stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner  so that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc

nepal  
in nepal  eia has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s  in the planning history of nepal  the sixth plan  198085   for the first time  recognized the need for eia with the establishment of environmental impact study project  eisp  under the department of soil conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of eia in infrastructure development projects  however  the government of nepal enunciated environment conservation related policies in the seventh plan  npc  19851990   to enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements  a series of guidelines were developed  thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system  in addition  it has also emphasized that eias of industry  tourism  water resources  transportation  urbanization  agriculture  forest and other developmental projects be conducted 
in nepal  the governments environmental impact assessment guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the environment protection act  epa  of 1997 and the environment protection rules  epr  of 1997  epa and epr have been enforced since 24 and 26 june 1997 respectively in nepal  to internalizing the environmental assessment system  the process institutionalized the eia process in development proposals and enactment  which makes the integration of iee and eia legally binding to the prescribed projects  the projects  requiring eia or iee  are included in schedules 1 and 2 of the epr  1997  gon moljpa 1997   progresses were made in the environmental protection issue during the 8th five-year plan  19921997   the following development in environmental protection were achieved during that time

new zealand  
in new zealand  eia is usually referred to as assessment of environmental effects  aee   the first use of eia s dates back to a cabinet minute passed in 1974 called environmental protection and enhancement procedures  this had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments  when the
was passed in 1991  an eia was required as part of a resource consent application  section 88 of the act specifies that the aee must include  such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment   while there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application  sections 36a and schedule 4   proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under section 93 
russian federation  
as of 2004  the state authority responsible for conducting the state eia in russia has been split between two federal bodies  1  federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources  a part of the russian ministry for natural resources and environment and 2  federal service for ecological  technological and nuclear control  the two main pieces of environmental legislation in russia are  the federal law on ecological expertise  1995 and the regulations on assessment of impact from intended business and other activity on environment in the russian federation  2000 
federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources  
in 2006  the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the ministry for natural resources and environment  created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas  there has been some success in this area  as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered amur leopard in the russian far east 
federal service for ecological  technological and nuclear control  
the governments decision to hand over control over several important procedures  including state eia in the field of all types of energy projects  to the federal service for ecological  technological and nuclear control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state eia 
not surprisingly the main problem concerning state eia in russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned federal bodies

united states  
main article 
the
of 1969  nepa   enacted in 1970  established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions  federally funded activities or federally permitted licensed activities that in the u  s  is termed  environmental review  or simply  the nepa process   the law also created the   which promulgated regulations to codify the law s requirements  under
an environmental assessment  ea  is compiled to determine the need for an
 eis   federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a notice of intent to prepare an eis as soon as significance is known  certain actions of
must be preceded by the nepa process  contrary to a widespread misconception  nepa does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees permittees from harming the environment  nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate  intentionally or otherwise  nepa requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance  the purpose of nepa process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision 
environmental assessment  
an environmental assessment  ea  is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the national environmental policy act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed environmental impact statement  eis   the certified release of an environmental assessment results in either a finding of no significant impact  fonsi  or an  
the
 ceq   which oversees the administration of nepa  issued regulations for implementing the nepa in 1979  eccleston reports that the nepa regulations barely mention preparation of eas  this is because the ea was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an eis  but today  because eiss are so much longer and complicated to prepare  federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing eiss by using eas  even in cases where the use of eas may be inappropriate  the ratio of eas that are being issued compared to eiss is about 100 to 1 
likewise  even the preparation of an accurate ea is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal  federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement nepa environmental review  by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under nepa  and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted 
content  
the environmental assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to 
briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or a finding of no significant impact  fonsi 
demonstrate compliance with the act when no eis is required
facilitate the preparation of an eis when a fonsi cannot be demonstrated
the environmental assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by nepa 102 2  e   and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable  plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions  the action agency must approve an ea before it is made available to the public  the ea is made public through notices of availability by local  state  or regional clearing houses  often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area 
structure  
the structure of a generic environmental assessment is as follows 
summary
introduction
background
purpose and need for action
proposed action
decision framework
public involvement
issues
alternatives  including the proposed action
alternatives
mitigation common to all alternatives
comparison of alternatives
environmental consequences
consultation and coordination
procedure  
the ea becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published  usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal  there is a 15-day review period required for an environmental assessment  30 days if exceptional circumstances  while the document is made available for public commentary  and a similar time for any objection to improper process  commenting on the draft ea is typically done in writing or email  submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability  an ea does not require a public hearing for verbal comments  following the mandated public comment period  the lead action agency responds to any comments  and certifies either a fonsi or a notice of intent  noi  to prepare an eis in its public environmental review record  the preparation of an eis then generates a similar but more lengthy  involved and expensive process 
environmental impact statement  
main article 
the adequacy of an environmental impact statement  eis  can be challenged in   major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency s failure to prepare an acceptable eis  one prominent example was the
landfill and highway development in and along the
in   another prominent case involved the
suing the
over its denial of the club s request to issue a supplemental eis addressing air emissions of
and hazardous
in the case of widening
through   the case reached the   which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court s final decision  the case was settled prior to the court s final decision 
several
that have adopted  little nepas  
imposing eis requirements for particular state actions  some those state laws such as the
refer to the required environmental impact study as an environmental impact report 
these variety of state requirements are yielding voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects  but also to elucidate scientific areas that had not been sufficiently researched  for example  in a seemingly routine environmental impact report for the city of   information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of   a rare coastal  
transboundary application  
environmental threats do not respect national borders  international pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere  oceans  rivers    farmland  the weather and biodiversity  global climate change is transnational  specific pollution threats include      
and toxic   the   precipitated by a
on april 26  1986  is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution 
environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties  the
 unche or stockholm conference  held in
in 1972 and the
 unced or rio summit  rio conference  or earth summit  held in
in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection 
the
was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary eia 
however  as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate  most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements  there is also the issue of international enforcement  this has led to duplications and failures  in part due to an inability to enforce agreements  an example is the failure of many international fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises 
criticism  
as per jay et al   eia is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool  there is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited  improved training for practitioners  guidance on best practice and continuing research have all been proposed 
eias have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time  no accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries  the boundary refers to the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposals effects  this boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor  but in practice  almost all eias address only direct and immediate on-site effects 
development causes both direct and indirect effects  consumption of goods and services  production  use and disposal of building materials and machinery  additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services  mining and refining  etc   all have environmental impacts  the indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an eia  proposals such as
or
cause wide-ranging national and international effects  which should be covered in eias 
broadening the scope of eia can benefit the conservation of threatened species  instead of concentrating on the project site  some eias employed a -based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment  as a result  alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species  rather than local subpopulations  can be assessed 
thissen and agusdinata
have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research  in line with this  maier et al  have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process  in such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty  these proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed  tenney et al  and wood et al  have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to eias predictions from a number of case studies worldwide  the gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in eias and the impacts measured during  or following project implementation  in explaining this trend  tenney et al  have highlighted major causes such as project changes  modelling errors  errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed  cardenas and halman
