the biosphere is the global sum of all   the two joined words are  bio  and  sphere   it can also be termed as the zone of
on   a closed system  apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the earth   and largely self-regulating  by the most general
definition  the biosphere is the global
system integrating all living beings and their relationships  including their interaction with the elements of the       and   the biosphere is postulated to have   beginning with a process of
 life created naturally from non-living matter  such as simple organic compounds  or
 life created from living matter   at least some 3.5 billion years ago  the earliest evidence for

found in 3.48 billion-year-old
from   more recently  in 2015   remains of   were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia  according to one of the researchers   if life arose relatively quickly on earth     then it could be common in the   
in a general sense  biospheres are any closed  self-regulating systems containing ecosystems  this includes artificial biospheres such as
and   and potentially ones on other planets or moons

origin and use of the term  
a
scene on earth  simultaneously showing the lithosphere  ground   hydrosphere  ocean  and atmosphere  air 
the term  biosphere  was coined by geologist
in 1875  which he defined as the place on earth s surface where life dwells 
while the concept has a geological origin  it is an indication of the effect of both
and
on the   the biosphere s ecological context comes from the 1920s  see    preceding the 1935 introduction of the term    by sir
 see    vernadsky defined
as the science of the biosphere  it is an
concept for integrating              
and  generally speaking  all life and earth sciences 
narrow definition  
geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms  the    or    as referred to by biologists and ecologists   in this sense  the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model  the other three being     and   when these four component spheres are combined into one system  it is known as the   this term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet 
the second international conference on closed life systems defined biospherics as the science and technology of analogs and
of  s biosphere  i e   artificial earth-like biospheres  others may include the creation of artificial non-earth biospheresfor example  human-centered biospheres or a native
biosphereas part of the topic of biospherics

have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the earth s terrestrial surface  and that the total mass of
life in so-called  uninhabitable zones  may  in   exceed all animal and plant life on the surface  the actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure  birds typically fly at altitudes as high as 1,800m  5,900ft  1.1mi  and fish live as much as 8,372m  27,467ft  5.202mi  underwater in the

microorganisms  which includes bacteria and archaea  but not the nucleated

marine microbes have been found at more than a depth of 10,000m  33,000ft  6.2mi  in the   the deepest spot in the earth s oceans  in fact  single-celled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the mariana trench  by the   at depths of 11,034m  36,201ft  6.856mi   other researchers reported related studies that microorganisms thrive inside rocks up to 580m  1,900ft  0.36mi  below the sea floor under 2,590m  8,500ft  1.61mi  of ocean off the coast of the northwestern   as well as 2,400m  7,900ft  1.5mi  beneath the seabed off japan  culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than 5,000m  16,000ft  3.1mi  into the

into the   the rate at which the temperature increases depends on many factors  including type of crust  continental vs  oceanic   rock type  geographic location  etc  the greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122c  252f    strain 116   and it is likely that the limit of life in the  deep biosphere  is defined by temperature rather than absolute depth    on 20 august 2014  scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800m  2,600ft  0.50mi  below the ice of   according to one researcher   you can find microbes everywhere  they re extremely adaptable to conditions  and survive wherever they are  
our biosphere is divided into a number of   inhabited by fairly similar
and   on land  biomes are separated primarily by   terrestrial biomes lying within the

are relatively barren of

extraterrestrial biospheres  
no biospheres have been detected beyond the earth  therefore  the existence of extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical  the
suggests they should be very rare  save ones composed of
life only  on the other hand 
may be quite numerous  at least in the
galaxy  given limited understanding of   it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres 
it is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future  for example on   the process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of earth s biosphere is called
