career  
greenpeace  
according to greenpeace  how a group of ecologists  journalists  and visionaries changed the world by rex wyler  the
was formed in january 1970 by
and     marie and   paul cote  and
and incorporated in october 1970  the committee had formed to plan opposition to the testing of a one megaton hydrogen bomb in 1969 by the
on
island in the   moore joined the committee in 1971 and  as greenpeace co-founder bob hunter wrote  moore was quickly accepted into the inner circle on the basis of his scientific background  his reputation  as an environmental activist   and his ability to inject practical  no-nonsense insights into the discussions 
moore traveled to alaska on advanced research with jim bohlen  attending wave committee meetings  in 1971  moore was a member of the crew of the phyllis cormack  a chartered fishing boat which the committee sent across the north pacific in order to draw attention to the us testing of a 5 megaton bomb planned for september of that year  greenpeace was the name given to the boat for the voyage and it would be the first of the many greenpeace protests  following the first voyage  key crew members decided to formally change the name of the don t make a wave committee to the greenpeace foundation  these decision makers included founders bob hunter  rod marining and
as well as patrick moore 
following us president  s cancellation of the remaining hydrogen bomb tests planned for amchitka island in early 1972  greenpeace turned its attention to french atmospheric nuclear testing at
atoll in the south pacific  in may 1972  moore traveled to new york with
and marie bohlen to lobby the key united nations delegations from the
countries involved  moore then went to europe together with ben metcalfe  dorothy metcalfe  lyle thurston and rod marining where they received an audience with pope paul vi and protested at
in paris  in june  they attended the first
in
where they convinced new zealand to propose a vote condemning french nuclear testing  which passed with a strong majority 
moore again crewed the phyllis cormack in 1975 during the first campaign to save whales  as greenpeace met the soviet whaling fleet off the coast of california  during the confrontation  film footage was caught of the soviet whaling boat firing a harpoon over the heads of greenpeace members in a
inflatable and into the back of a female   the film footage made the evening news the next day on all three us national networks  initiating greenpeace s debut on the world media stage  and prompting a swift rise in public support of the charity  patrick moore and bob hunter appeared on dr   s talk radio show on
and appealed for a lawyer to help them incorporate a branch office in san francisco and to manage donations  david tussman  a young lawyer  volunteered to help moore  hunter  and
set up an office at   the greenpeace foundation of america  since changed to greenpeace usa   then became the major fundraising center for the expansion of greenpeace worldwide 
presidency of greenpeace foundation in canada  
in early 1977  bob hunter stepped down as president of the greenpeace foundation and patrick moore was elected president  he inherited an organization that was deeply in debt  greenpeace organizations began to form throughout north america  including cities such as toronto  montreal  seattle  portland  los angeles  boston  and san francisco  not all of these offices accepted the authority of the founding organization in canada  moore s presidency and governance style proved controversial    moore and his chosen board in vancouver called for two meetings to formalize his governance proposals  during this time david tussman  together with the rest of the founders  early activists of greenpeace  and the majority of greenpeace staff-members announced that the board of the san francisco group intended to separate patrick moore s greenpeace foundation from the rest of the greenpeace movement  after efforts to settle the matter failed  the greenpeace foundation filed a civil lawsuit in san francisco charging that the san francisco group was in violation of trademark and copyright by using the greenpeace name without permission of the greenpeace foundation 
the lawsuit was settled at a meeting on 10 october 1979  in the offices of lawyer david gibbons in vancouver  attending were moore  hunter      and about six others  at this meeting it was agreed that greenpeace international would be created  this meant that greenpeace would remain a single organization rather than an amorphous collection of individual offices  mctaggart who had come to represent all the other greenpeace groups against the greenpeace foundation  was named chairman  moore became president of greenpeace canada  the new name for greenpeace foundation  and a director of greenpeace international  other directors were appointed from the us  france  the uk  and the netherlands  he served for nine years as president of greenpeace canada  as well as six years as a director of  
in 1985  moore was on board the
  he and other directors of greenpeace international were greeting the ship off the coast of new zealand on its way to protest french nuclear testing at   expedition photographer    was killed  greenpeace s media presence peaked again 
after greenpeace  
in 1986  after leaving greenpeace over differences in policy  moore established a family
business  quatsino seafarms  at his home in   he commented that he had left greenpeace because it  took a sharp turn to the political left  and  evolved into an organization of extremism and politically motivated agendas  
in this year he was also elected president of the british columbia salmon farmers association  from 1990-4 he was appointed to the british columbia round table on the environment and the economy and founded and chaired the b c  carbon project  in 1991  he joined the board of the forest alliance of bc  an initiative of the ceos of the major forest companies in british columbia  as chair of the sustainable forestry committee of the forest alliance he spent ten years developing the principles of sustainable forestry  which were later adopted by much of the industry  in 1991  moore also founded greenspirit to  promote sustainable development from a scientific environmental platform   in 2002  tom tevlin and trevor figueiredo joined moore in the formation of the environmental consultancy company greenspirit strategies ltd 
moore served for four years as vice president of environment for waterfurnace international manufacturing
heat pumps  in 2000  moore published green spirit - trees are the answer  a photo-book on forests and the role they can play in solving some current environmental problems  he also made two appearances on
in episodes environmental hysteria  2003  and endangered species  2005   in 2006  moore became co-chair  with   of a new industry-funded initiative  the clean and safe energy coalition  which promotes increased use of nuclear energy  in 2010  moore was recruited to represent the indonesian logging firm
 app   a multi-national accused by activist groups of widespread and illegal rainforest clearance practices  although this is strongly disputed by moore 
views  
in 2005  moore criticized what he saw as scare tactics and disinformation employed by some within the environmental movement  saying that the environmental movement  abandoned science and logic in favor of emotion and sensationalism   moore contends that for the environmental movement  most of the really serious problems have been dealt with   seeking now to  invent doom and gloom scenarios   he suggests they romanticise peasant life as part of an anti-industrial campaign to prevent development in less-developed countries  which he describes as  anti-human   moore was interviewed in the 2007 film documentary   in which he expressed similar views  in 2007
reported on his writings for the
arguing against the theory that mankind was causing   noting his advocacy for the felling of tropical
and the planting of
crops  he has expressed his positive views of logging on the greenspirit website  in 2010  moore was commissioned by forestry giant
to report on its logging activity in indonesia s rainforests  resulting in a glowing review 
energy  
moore was opposed to
in the 1970s when he  believed that nuclear energy was synonymous with   and  everything nuclear was evil   but has since   come to be in favor of it 
moore is supported by the
 nei   a national organization of pro-nuclear industries and in 2009 he chaired their clean and safe energy coalition  as chair  he suggested that the mainstream media and the environmentalist movement is not as opposed to nuclear energy as in decades past   
he argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on
or
emissions would require increased use of nuclear energy to supply
power  he has also criticized the costs and reliability of  
global warming  
moore calls global warming the  most difficult issue facing the scientific community today in terms of being able to actually predict with any kind of accuracy what s going to happen   in 2006  he wrote to the
arguing there was  no scientific proof  that mankind was causing global warming and believes that it  has a much better correlation with changes in solar activity than co2 levels  
moore has stated that
and the melting of glaciers is not necessarily a negative event because it creates more
and the use of forest products drives up demand for wood and spurs the planting of more trees  rather than   moore advocates  
in 2014  moore testified to the u s  congress on the subject of global warming  there is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide  co2  are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the earths atmosphere over the past 100 years  according to moores testimony  today  we live in an unusually cold period in the history of life on earth and there is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species  moore continued   the fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when co2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused co2 emissions are the main cause of global warming  when modern life evolved over 500 million years ago  co2 was more than 10 times higher than today  yet life flourished at this time  he added  then an ice age occurred 450 million years ago when co2 was 10 times higher than today    humans just arent capable of predicting global temperature changes  
a march 2014 episode of the american program
featured moore making the statement that the earth  has not warmed for the last 17 years  in a debate with
 
rated moore s assertion  mostly false   remarking that a significant net warming over that time-frame had occurred even though the spread was relatively flat as well as that moore cherry-picked the time-frame to obscure the overall heating trend 
on july 26  2015 multiple videos were posted on
with moore presenting with the title of  co-founder of greenpeace   included is a 5 40 video titled
that explains his version of his involvement and departure from greenpeace  other videos presented by moore include
 at 1 34 he states  temperatures and carbon dioxide levels do not show a strong correlation   with a chart    are gmos good or bad     the truth about co2  and  trees are the answer  
genetically modified foods  
in 2006  moore addressed a
conference in
saying   there s no getting away from the fact that over 6 billion people wake up each day on this planet with real needs for food  energy and materials   and need
to this end 
moore supports the adoption of
to prevent  
health effects of glyphosate  
during march 2015 in an interview by french investigative journalist   which was first broadcast on french television station
in september 2014  moore was asked about the safety of the herbicide   moore told
that one  could drink a whole quart of it  without any harm  when moore was challenged to drink a glass of the weedkiller  he refused  and ended the interview  the interview came shortly after the release of a
 who  report adding glyphosate to a list of  
criticism  
moore s views and change of stance  see above  have evoked controversy in environmentalist arenas  he is accused of having  abruptly turned his back on the environmental movement  and  being a mouthpiece for some of the very interests greenpeace was founded to counter   his critics point out moore s business relations with  polluters and   through his consultancy  moore has earned his living since the early 1990s primarily by consulting for  and publicly speaking for a wide variety of corporations and lobby groups such as the   monte hummel  mscf  president 
canada has claimed that moore s book  pacific spirit  is a collection of   and dubious assumptions  
the writer and environmental activist
has written critically of moore s work with the indonesian logging firm
 app   moore was hired as a consultant to write an environmental  inspection report  on app operations  according to monbiot  moore s company is not a monitoring firm and the consultants used were experts in public relations  not tropical ecology or indonesian law  monbiot has said that sections of the report were directly copied from an app pr brochure 
the   an anti-nuclear group  criticized moore saying that his comment in 1976 that  it should be remembered that there are employed in the nuclear industry some very high-powered public relations organizations  one can no more trust them to tell the truth about nuclear power than about which brand of toothpaste will result in this apparently insoluble problem  was seen as forecasting his own future  a
editorial criticizes the press for uncritically printing  pro-nuclear songs  such as moore s  citing his role as a paid spokesperson of the nuclear industry
