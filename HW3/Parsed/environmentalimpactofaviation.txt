the environmental impact of aviation occurs because
emit heat    particulates and gases which contribute to
and   among others airplanes emit particles and gases such as
 co2   water vapor       
and
which interact among themselves and with the atmosphere 
despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting
and
engines  the rapid growth of
in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to   from 1992 to 2005  passenger kilometers increased 5.2  per year  and in the  
emissions from aviation increased by 87  between 1990 and 2006 
comprehensive research shows that despite anticipated efficiency innovations to airframes  engines  aerodynamics and flight operations  there is no end in sight  even many decades out  to rapid growth in co2 emissions from air travel and air freight  due to projected continual growth in air travel  this is because aviation emissions have escaped international regulation thus far    and because the lack  worldwide  of taxes on aviation fuel results in lower fares than otherwise which gives a competitive advantage over other transportation modes    unless market constraints are put in place this growth in aviation s emissions will result in the sector s emissions amounting to all or nearly all of the annual global
emissions budget by mid-century  if climate change is to be held to a temperature increase of 2c or less 
there is an ongoing debate about possible
of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an
scheme  with a view to ensuring that the total

climate change  
radiative forcings from aviation emissions  gases and aerosols  in 1992 as estimated by the
like all human activities involving   most forms of
release
 co2  and other greenhouse gases into the earth s   contributing to the acceleration of
and  in the case of co2    these concerns are highlighted by the present volume of commercial aviation and its rate of growth  globally  about 8.3 million people fly daily  3 billion occupied seats per year   twice the total in 1999  u s  airlines alone burned about 16.2 billion gallons of fuel during the twelve months between october 2013 and september 2014 
in addition to the co2 released by most aircraft in flight through the burning of fuels such as
 turbine aircraft  or
 piston aircraft   the aviation industry also contributes
emissions from ground
vehicles and those used by passengers and staff to access airports  as well as through emissions generated by the production of energy used in airport buildings  the manufacture of
and the construction of airport infrastructure 
while the principal
emission from powered aircraft in flight is co2  other emissions may include
and
 together termed
or nox  
and
 soot and sulfate particles   sulfur oxides 
 which bonds with
to become co2 immediately upon release   incompletely burned  
 piston aircraft only   and radicals such as   depending on the type of aircraft in use  emissions weighting factor  ewfs  i e   the factor by which aviation co2 emissions should be multiplied to get the co2-equivalent emissions for annual fleet average conditions is in the range 1.32.9 
mechanisms and cumulative effects of aviation on climate  
in 1999 the contribution of civil aircraft-in-flight to global co2 emissions was estimated to be around 2   however  in the case of high-altitude
which frequently fly near or in the   non-co2 altitude-sensitive effects may increase the total impact on anthropogenic  human-made 
significantly  a 2007 report from
  oxford university posits a range closer to 4 percent cumulative effect  subsonic aircraft-in-flight contribute to climate change in four ways 
carbon dioxide  co2   
co2 emissions from aircraft-in-flight are the most significant and best understood element of aviation s total contribution to climate change  the level and effects of co2 emissions are currently believed to be broadly the same regardless of altitude  i e  they have the same atmospheric effects as ground based emissions   in 1992  emissions of co2 from aircraft were estimated at around 2  of all such anthropogenic emissions  and that year the atmospheric concentration of co2 attributable to aviation was around 1  of the total anthropogenic increase since the industrial revolution  having accumulated primarily over just the last 50 years 
oxides of nitrogen  nox   
at the high altitudes flown by large jet airliners around the   emissions of nox are particularly effective in forming
 o3  in the upper   high altitude  813km  nox emissions result in greater concentrations of o3 than surface nox emissions  and these in turn have a greater global warming effect  the effect of o3 concentrations are regional and local  as opposed to co2 emissions  which are global    
nox emissions also reduce ambient levels of   another greenhouse gas  resulting in a climate cooling effect  but this effect does not offset the o3 forming effect of nox emissions  it is now believed that aircraft
and water emissions in the
tend to deplete o3  partially offsetting the nox-induced o3 increases  these effects have not been quantified  this problem does not apply to aircraft that fly lower in the troposphere  such as light aircraft or many commuter aircraft 
water vapor  h2o   and contrails  
formation
one of the products of burning hydrocarbons in oxygen is water vapour  a greenhouse gas  water vapour produced by aircraft engines at high altitude  under certain atmospheric conditions  condenses into droplets to form   or contrails  contrails are visible line clouds that form in cold  humid atmospheres and are thought to have a global warming effect  though one less significant than either co2 emissions or nox induced effects   contrails are extremely rare from lower-altitude aircraft  or from -driven aircraft or rotorcraft 
have been observed to develop after the persistent formation of contrails and have been found to have a global warming effect over-and-above that of contrail formation alone  there is a degree of scientific uncertainty about the contribution of contrail and cirrus cloud formation to global warming and attempts to estimate aviation s overall climate change contribution do not tend to include its effects on cirrus cloud enhancement  however  a 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by contrail  outbreaks  reduce the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures  the former are decreased and the latter are increased  in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks  on days with outbreaks the day night temperature difference was diminished by about 6f in the u s  south and 5f in the midwest 
particulates  
least significant is the release of soot and sulfate particles  soot absorbs heat and has a warming effect  sulfate particles reflect radiation and have a small cooling effect  in addition  they can influence the formation and properties of clouds  all aircraft powered by combustion will release some amount of soot 
greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometre  
averaged emissions  
emissions of passenger aircraft per passenger kilometre vary extensively because of differing factors such as the size and type aircraft  the altitude and the percentage of passenger or freight capacity of a particular flight  and the distance of the journey and number of stops en route  also  the effect of a given amount of emissions on climate    is greater at higher altitudes  see below  some representative figures for co2 emissions are provided by lipasto s survey of average direct emissions  not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects  of airliners expressed as co2 and co2 equivalent per passenger kilometre 
domestic  short distance  less than 463km  288mi   257 g km co2 or 259 g km  14.7 oz mile  co2e
domestic  long distance  greater than 463km  288mi   177 g km co2 or 178 g km  10.1 oz mile  co2e
long distance flights  113 g km co2 or 114 g km  6.5 oz mile  co2e
these emissions are similar to a four-seat car with one person on board  however  flying trips often cover longer distances than would be undertaken by car  so the total emissions are much higher  for perspective  per passenger a typical economy-class new york to los angeles round trip produces about 715kg  1574lb  of co2  but is equivalent to 1,917kg  4,230lb  of co2 when the high altitude  climatic forcing  effect is taken into account   within the categories of flights above  emissions from scheduled jet flights are substantially higher than turboprop or chartered jet flights  about 60  of aviation emissions arise from international flights  and these flights are not covered by the kyoto protocol and its emissions reduction targets 
figures from british airways suggest carbon dioxide emissions of 100g per passenger kilometre for large jet airliners  a figure which does not account for the production of other pollutants or condensation trails  
emissions by passenger class  and effects of seating configuration  
in 2013 the world bank published a study of the effect on co2 emissions of its staff s travel in business class or first class  versus using economy class  among the factors considered was that these premium classes displace proportionately more economy seats for the same total aircraft space capacity  and the associated differing load factors and weight factors  this was not accounted for in prior standard carbon accounting methods  the study concluded that when considering respective average load factors  percent of occupied seats  in each of the seating classes  the carbon footprints of business class and first class are three-times and nine-times higher than economy class  a related article by the international council on clean transport notes further regarding the effect of seating configurations on carbon emissions that 
the a380 is marketed as a  green giant  and one of the most environmentally advanced aircraft out there  but that spin is based on a maximum-capacity aircraft configuration  or about 850 economy passengers  in reality  a typical a380 aircraft has 525 seats  its fuel performance is comparable to that of a b747-400 er and even about 15  worse than a b777-300er on a passenger-mile basis  calculated using piano-5 on a flight from auh to lhr  assuming an 80  passenger load factor  and in-service fleet average seat counts  
total climate effects  
in attempting to aggregate and quantify the total climate impact of aircraft emissions the
 ipcc  has estimated that aviation s total climate impact is some 2-4 times that of its direct co2 emissions alone  excluding the potential impact of cirrus cloud enhancement   this is measured as   while there is uncertainty about the exact level of impact of nox and water vapour  governments have accepted the broad scientific view that they do have an effect  globally in 2005  aviation contributed  possibly as much as 4.9  of radiative forcing  
statements have stressed the need for aviation to address its total climate change impacts and not simply the impact of co2 
the ipcc has estimated that aviation is responsible for around 3.5  of anthropogenic climate change  a figure which includes both co2 and non-co2 induced effects  the ipcc has produced scenarios estimating what this figure could be in 2050  the central case estimate is that aviation s contribution could grow to 5  of the total contribution by 2050 if action is not taken to tackle these emissions  though the highest scenario is 15   moreover  if other industries achieve significant cuts in their own greenhouse gas emissions  aviation s share as a proportion of the remaining emissions could also rise 
future emission levels  
even though there have been significant improvements in
through aircraft technology and operational management as described here  these improvements are being continually eclipsed by the increase in air traffic volume 
a december 2015 report finds that aircraft could generate 701343000000000000043 of carbon pollution through to 2050  consuming almost 5  of the remaining global climate budget  without regulation  global aviation emissions may triple by mid-century and could emit more than 70123000000000000003gt of carbon annually under a high-growth  business-as-usual scenario  efforts to bring aviation emissions under an effective global accord have so far largely failed  despite there being a number of technological and operational improvements on offer 
continual increases in travel and freight  
from 1992 to 2005  passenger kilometers increased 5.2  per year  even with the disruptions of 9/11 and two significant wars  since the onset of the current recession 
during the first three quarters of 2010  air travel markets expanded at an annualized rate approaching 10   this is similar to the rate seen in the rapid expansion prior to the recession  november s results mean the annualized rate of growth so far in q4 drops back to around 6   but this is still in line with long run rates of traffic growth seen historically  the level of international air travel is now 4  above the pre-recession peak of early 2008 and the current expansion looks to have further to run 
air freight reached a new high point in may  2010  but  following the end of inventory restocking activity  volumes have slipped back to settle at a similar level seen just before the onset of recession  even so  that means an expansion of air freight during 2010 of 5-6  on an annualized basis  close to historical trend  with the stimulus of inventory restocking activity removed  further growth in air freight demand will be driven by end consumer demand for goods which utilize the air transport supply chain      the end of the inventory cycle does not mean the end of volume expansion but markets are entering a slower growth phase 
in a 2008 presentation and paper
professor
of the
showed how continued aviation growth in the uk threatens the ability of that nation to meet co2 emission reduction goals necessary to contain the century-end temperature increase to even 4 or 6c   see also  the
and its proceedings   his charts show the projected domestic aviation carbon emission increase for the uk as growing from 11 mt in 2006 to 17 mt in 2012  at the uk s historic annual emission growth rate of 7   beyond 2012 if the growth rate were reduced to 3  yearly  carbon emissions in 2030 would be 28 mt  which is 70  of the uk s entire carbon emissions budget that year for all sectors of society  this work also suggests the foreseeable future which confronts many other nations that have high dependency on aviation   hypermobile travelers   an academic study by
et al   2009  in the book  climate change and aviation   also points to the dilemma caused by the increasing
both in particular nations and globally 
what is the scope for improving efficiency  to reduce emissions   
aircraft efficiency  
while it is true that late model jet aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient  and thus emit less co2 in particular  than the earliest jet airliners  new airliner models in the first decade of the 21st century were barely more efficient on a seat-mile basis than the latest piston-powered airliners of the late 1950s  e g 
and    claims for a high gain in efficiency for airliners over recent decades  while true in part  has been biased high in most studies  by using the early inefficient models of jet airliners as a baseline  those aircraft were optimized for increased revenue  including increased speed and cruising altitude  and were quite fuel inefficient in comparison to their piston-powered forerunners 
today  turboprop aircraft  probably in part because of their lower cruising speeds and altitudes  similar to the earlier piston-powered airliners  compared to jet airliners  play an obvious role in the overall fuel efficiency of major airlines that have regional carrier subsidiaries  for example  although
scored at the top of a 2011-2012 fuel efficiency ranking  if its large regional carrier  turbo-prop equipped
 were dropped from the lumped-in consideration  the airline s ranking would be somewhat lower  as noted in the ranking study 
aircraft manufacturers are striving for reductions in both co2 and nox emissions with each new generation of design of aircraft and engine  while the introduction of more modern aircraft represents an opportunity to reduce emissions per passenger kilometre flown  aircraft are major investments that endure for many decades  and replacement of the international fleet is therefore a long-term proposition which will greatly delay realizing the climate benefits of many kinds of improvements  engines can be changed at some point  but nevertheless airframes have a long life    moreover  rather than being linear from one year to the next the improvements to efficiency tend to diminish over time  as reflected in the histories of both piston and jet powered aircraft 
a 2014
of the cradle-to-grave reduction in co2 by a
 cfrp  airliner such as a boeing 787  including its manufacture  operations and eventual disposal  has shown that by 2050 such aircraft could reduce the airline industry s co2 emissions by 14-15   compared use of conventional airliners  the benefit of cfrp technology is not higher than that amount of reduction  despite the lighter weight and substantially lower fuel consumption of such aircraft   because of the limited fleet penetration by 2050 and the increased demand for air travel due to lower operating costs  
operations efficiency  
research projects such as boeing s
program have sought to identify ways of improving the efficiency of commercial aircraft operations  the u s  government has encouraged such research through grant programs  including the faa s continuous lower energy  emissions and noise  cleen  program  and nasa s environmentally responsible aviation  era  project 
adding an electric drive to the airplane s nose wheel may improve fuel efficiency during ground handling  this addition would allow taxiing without use of the main engines  33  34  35 
another proposed change is the integrating of an
to the airstrips of airports  some companies such as airbus are currently researching this possibility  the adding of emals would allow the civilan aircraft to use considerably less fuel  as a lot of fuel is spend during take off  and in comparison  less during flight  when calculated per km flown   the idea is to have the aircraft take off at regular aircraft speed  and only use the catapult for take-off  not for landing 
other opportunities arise from the optimisation of airline timetables  route networks and flight frequencies to increase load factors  minimise the number of empty seats flown   together with the optimisation of airspace  however  these are each one-time gains  and as these opportunities are successively fulfilled  diminishing returns can be expected from the remaining opportunities 
another possible reduction of the climate-change impact is the limitation of cruise altitude of aircraft  this would lead to a significant reduction in high-altitude contrails for a marginal trade-off of increased flight time and an estimated 4  increase in co2 emissions  drawbacks of this solution include very limited airspace capacity to do this  especially in europe and north america and increased fuel burn because jet aircraft are less efficient at lower cruise altitudes 
while they are not suitable for long-haul or transoceanic flights  turboprop aircraft used for commuter flights bring two significant benefits  they often burn considerably less fuel per passenger mile  and they typically fly at lower altitudes  well inside the tropopause  where there are no concerns about ozone or contrail production 
alternative fuels

some scientists and companies such as
and
are researching
technology for use in jet aircraft  some aircraft engines  like the
can  being a 2-stroke diesel engine  run on   also  a number of
 
in addition  there are also several tests done combining regular petrofuels with a biofuel  for example  as part of this test
flew a
from london
to amsterdam
on 24 february 2008  with one engine burning a combination of
and    s chief scientist
said that the flight was  high-altitude   and that producing organic oils to make
could lead to deforestation and a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions  also  the majority of the world s aircraft are not large jetliners but smaller piston aircraft  and with major modifications many are capable of using
as a fuel  another consideration is the vast amount of land that would be necessary to provide the biomass feedstock needed to support the needs of aviation  both civil and military 
in december 2008  an
jet completed the world s first commercial aviation test flight partially using -based fuel  jatropha  used for biodiesel  can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won t grow  or would produce only slow growth yields  air new zealand set several general sustainability criteria for its jatropha  saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources  that they must be as good as traditional jet fuels  and that they should be cost competitive with existing fuels 
in january 2009 
used a sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft for the first time in north america  this marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft  a   powered by cfm international cfm56-7b engines  the biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants 
one fuel biofuel alternative to
that is under development is   swift fuel was approved as a test fuel by
in december 2009  allowing the company to continue their research and to pursue certification testing  mary rusek  president and co-owner of swift enterprises predicted at that time that  100sf will be comparably priced  environmentally friendlier and more fuel-efficient than other general aviation fuels on the market  
as of june 2011  revised international aviation fuel standards officially allow commercial airlines to blend conventional jet fuel with up to 50 percent biofuels  the renewable fuels  can be blended with conventional commercial and military jet fuel through requirements in the newly issued edition of astm d7566  specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons  
in december 2011  the faa announced it is awarding  7.7 million to eight companies to advance the development of drop-in commercial aviation biofuels  with a special focus on atj  alcohol to jet  fuel  as part of its caafi  commercial aviation alternative fuel initiative  and cleen  continuous lower emissions  energy and noise  programs  the faa plans to assist in the development of a sustainable fuel  from alcohols  sugars  biomass  and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils  that can be  dropped in  to aircraft without changing current infrastructure  the grant will also be used to research how the fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards 
finally 
is another fuel that is used in some airplanes  besides the lower ghg emissions  depending from where the natural gas was obtained from   another major benefit to airplane operators is the price  which is far lower than the price for jet fuel 
reducing air travel  
personal choices and social pressure  
the german video short the bill explores how travel and its impacts are commonly viewed in everyday developed-world life  and the social pressures that are at play  british writer george marshall has investigated common rationalizations that act as barriers to making personal choices to travel less  or to justify recent trips  in an informal research project   one you are welcome to join   he says  he deliberately steered conversations with people who are attuned to climate change problems to questions about recent long-distance flights and why the travel was justified  reflecting on actions contrary to their beliefs  he noted    i ntriguing as their dissonance may be  what is especially revealing is that every one of these people has a career that is predicated on the assumption that information is sufficient to generate change  an assumption that a moment s introspection would show them was deeply flawed  
business and professional choices  
with most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants  and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane  conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related ghg emissions could be made      this does not mean non-attendance   reay 2004 
for example  by 2003
has already been successfully used to host several international conferences  and technology has likely progressed substantially since then  the tyndall centre for climate change research has been systematically studying means to change common institutional and professional practices that have led to large carbon footprints of travel by research scientists  and issued a report   le qur et al  2015  
ending incentives to flyfrequent flyer programs  
over 130 airlines have    based at least in part on miles  kilometers  points or segments for flights taken  globally  such programs included about 163 million people as reported in 2006  these programs benefit airlines by habituating people to air travel and  through the mechanics of partnerships with credit card companies and other businesses  in which high profit margin revenue streams can amount to selling free seats for a high price  the only part of
business that was making money when the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002 was its frequent flyer program 
concerning business travel   the ease of international air travel and the fact that  for most of us  the costs are met by our employers  means that     globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a perk of the job   however  the perk usually is not only the business trip itself  but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip  and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel  thus a
is established  whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary  even when such conflict is not a motivation  the perk of frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds 
by just using an airline-sponsored credit card to pay one s household expenses  personal or business bills  or even expense bills charged to an employer  frequent flyer points can be racked up quickly  thus  free travelfor which the individual has to pay nothing extrabecomes a reality  across society  this too can be expected to lead to much air traveland greenhouse gas emissionsthat otherwise would not occur 
several studies have contemplated the elimination of frequent flyer programmes  ffps   on the grounds of anti-competitiveness  ethics  conflict with society s overall well-being  or climate effects  there is a record of governments disallowing or banning ffps and of industry players requesting bans  denmark did not allow the programs until 1992  then changing its policy because its airlines were disadvantaged  in 2002  norway banned domestic ffps in order to promote competition among its airlines  in the u s  in 1989  a vice president of braniff  said the government should consider ordering an end to frequent-flyer programs  which he said allow unfair competition  
a canadian study said that because of competition no airline could unilaterally end its ffp  but that a national government could use its regulatory power to end the programs broadly  which in canada s case would also require north america-wide cooperation  in further analysis  a scandinavian study which recommended an end to frequent flyer plans said   the only possible way of prohibiting ffps successfully now that they have spread from the us to europe to the far east would be to do so on a global basis  the basis exists  it could be done by the world trade organization   a recent study which surveyed frequent flyers in the u k  and norway  looked into behavioral addition to frequent flying and the  flyer s dilemma  of the conflict between  the social and personal benefits of flying and air travel s impact on climate change   it concluded that 
continued growth in both frequent flying practices and concern over air travel s climate impacts are in a dynamic relationship and the question of whether one or the other will reach a tipping point cannot yet be determined  self-regulation  external regulation  social norms  technology and physical resources will continue to co-constitute the balance  an increasing stigmatisation of  excessive  air travel may  re frame flying as more open to collective external mitigation 
this means government action 
potential for governmental constraints on demand  
one means for reducing the environmental impact of aviation is to constrain demand for air travel  through increased fares in place of expanded airport capacity  several studies have explored this 
the
study predict and decide  aviation  climate change and uk policy  notes that a 10  increase in fares generates a 5  to 15  reduction in demand  and recommends that the british government should manage demand rather than provide for it  this would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes   against the expansion of uk airport capacity  and constrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively 
a study published by the campaign group
 aef  concludes that by levying 9billion of additional taxes  the annual rate of growth in demand in the uk for air travel would be reduced to2  
the ninth report of the
  published in july 2006  recommends that the british government rethinks its airport expansion policy and considers ways  particularly via increased taxation  in which future demand can be managed in line with industry performance in achieving fuel efficiencies  so that emissions are not allowed to increase in absolute terms 
international regulation of air travel ghg emissions  
kyoto protocol 2005  
greenhouse gas emissions from fuel consumption in international aviation  in contrast to those from domestic aviation and from energy use by airports  are excluded from the scope of the first period  2008-2012  of the   as are the non-co2 climate effects  instead  governments agreed to work through the
 icao  to limit or reduce emissions and to find a solution to the allocation of emissions from international aviation in time for the second period of the kyoto protocol starting from 2009  however  the copenhagen climate conference failed to reach an agreement 
recent research points to this failure as a substantial obstacle to global policy including a co2 emissions reduction pathway that would
by keeping the increase in the average global temperature below a 2c rise 
approaches toward emissions trading  
as part of that process the icao has endorsed the adoption of an open
system to meet co2 emissions reduction objectives  guidelines for the adoption and implementation of a global scheme are currently being developed  and will be presented to the icao assembly in 2007  although the prospects of a comprehensive inter-governmental agreement on the adoption of such a scheme are uncertain 
within the   however  the
has resolved to incorporate aviation in the
 ets   a new directive was adopted by the european parliament in july 2008 and approved by the council in october 2008  it became effective on 1 january 2012 
researchers at the
investigated the possible effects on
 sids  of the  s decision to limit the supply of
 cers  to its
market to
 ldcs  from 2013  most sids are highly
to the effects of
and rely heavily on
as a basis for their economies  so this decision could place them at some disadvantage  the researchers therefore highlight the need to ensure that any regulatory frameworks put in place to tackle climate change take into account the development needs of the most vulnerable countries affected 
a report published by researchers at the
at
found that the only way to have a significant impact on emissions was to put a price on carbon and to use a market-based measure  mbm   such as the eu emissions trading scheme  ets  
international civil aviation organization agreement 2016  
in october 2016 the
agency
 icao  finalized an agreement among its 191 member nations to address the more than 7011458000000000000458  2010  of carbon dioxide emitted annually by international passenger and cargo flights  the agreement will use an offsetting scheme called corsia  the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation  under which forestry and other carbon-reducing activities are directly funded  amounting to about 2  of annual revenues for the sector  rules against  double counting  should ensure that existing forest protection efforts are not recycled  the scheme does not take effect until 2021 and will be voluntary until 2027  but many countries  including the us and china  have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date  under the agreement  the global aviation emissions target is an 80  reduction by 2035 relative to 2020 
reaction to the deal was mixed 
the agreement has critics  it is not aligned with the 2015 paris climate agreement  which set the objective of restricting global warming to 1.5 to 2c  a late draft of the agreement would have required the air transport industry to assess its share of global carbon budgeting to meet that objective  but the text was removed in the agreed version  corsia will regulate only about 25 percent of aviation s international emissions  since it grandfather s all emissions below the 2020 level  allowing unregulated growth until then  only 65 nations will participate in the initial voluntary period  not including significant emitters russia  india and perhaps brazil  the agreement does not cover domestic emissions  which are 40  of the global industry s overall emissions  one observer of the icao convention made this summary 
airline claims that flying will now be green are a myth  taking a plane is the fastest and cheapest way to fry the planet and this deal won t reduce demand for jet fuel one drop  instead offsetting aims to cut emissions in other industries 
although another critic called it  a timid step in the right direction  
effects of climate change on aviation  
increased turbulence  
a report published in the science journal nature climate change forecasts that increasing co2 levels will result in a significant increase in in-flight turbulence experienced by transatlantic airline flights by the middle of the 21st century  the lead author of the study  paul williams  a researcher at the national center for atmospheric science  at the university of reading stated   air turbulence does more than just interrupt the service of in-flight drinks  it injures hundreds of passengers and aircrew every year  sometimes fatally  it also causes delays and damage to planes
