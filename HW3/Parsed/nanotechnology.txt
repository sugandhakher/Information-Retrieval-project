nanotechnology   nanotech   is manipulation of matter on an     and
scale  the earliest  widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products  also now referred to as   a more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the   which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100   this definition reflects the fact that
effects are important at this
scale  and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold  it is therefore common to see the plural form  nanotechnologies  as well as  nanoscale technologies  to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size  because of the variety of potential applications  including industrial and military   governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research  until 2012  through its national nanotechnology initiative  the usa has invested 3.7 billion dollars  the european union has invested 1.2 billion and japan 750 million dollars 
nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad  including fields of science as diverse as             etc  the associated research and applications are equally diverse  ranging from extensions of conventional
to completely new approaches based upon   from developing
with dimensions on the nanoscale to  
scientists currently debate the future   nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of   such as in    
energy production  and consumer products  on the other hand  nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology  including concerns about the
and environmental impact of nanomaterials  and their potential effects on global economics  as well as speculation about various   these concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special

origins
main article 
the concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist
in his talk   in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms  the term  nano-technology  was first used by
in 1974  though it was not widely known 
comparison of nanomaterials sizes
inspired by feynman s concepts 
used the term  nanotechnology  in his 1986 book   which proposed the idea of a nanoscale  assembler  which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control  also in 1986  drexler co-founded
 with which he is no longer affiliated  to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications 
thus  emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of drexler s theoretical and public work  which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology  and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter  in the 1980s  two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era 
first  the invention of the
in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds  and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989  the microscope s developers
and
at
received a
in 1986  binnig 
and gerber also invented the analogous

buckminsterfullerene c60  also known as the   is a representative member of the
known as   members of the fullerene family are a major subject of research falling under the nanotechnology umbrella 
second 
were discovered in 1985 by     and   who together won the 1996   c60 was not initially described as nanotechnology  the term was used regarding subsequent work with related
tubes  called
and sometimes called bucky tubes  which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics and devices 
in the early 2000s  the field garnered increased scientific  political  and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress  controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies  exemplified by the  s report on nanotechnology  challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology  which culminated in a public debate between drexler and smalley in 2001 and 2003 
meanwhile  commercialization of products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging  these products are limited to bulk applications of
and do not involve atomic control of matter  some examples include the
platform for using
as an antibacterial agent  -based transparent sunscreens 
strengthening using silica nanoparticles  and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles 
governments moved to promote and
into nanotechnology  such as in the u s  with the   which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established funding for research on the nanoscale  and in europe via the european  
by the mid-2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish  projects emerged to produce nanotechnology roadmaps which center on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected capabilities  goals  and applications 
fundamental concepts
nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale  this covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced  in its original sense  nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up  using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete  high performance products 
one
 nm  is one billionth  or 109  of a meter  by comparison  typical carbon-carbon   or the spacing between these
in a   are in the range 0.120.15 nm  and a
double-helix has a diameter around 2nm  on the other hand  the smallest
life-forms  the bacteria of the genus   are around 200nm in length  by convention  nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the national nanotechnology initiative in the us  the lower limit is set by the size of atoms  hydrogen has the smallest atoms  which are approximately a quarter of a nm diameter  since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules  the upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device  these new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent
device  such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of  
to put that scale in another context  the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth  or another way of putting it  a nanometer is the amount an average man s beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face 
two main approaches are used in nanotechnology  in the  bottom-up  approach  materials and devices are built from molecular components which
chemically by principles of   in the  top-down  approach  nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control 
areas of physics such as    
and
have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology 
larger to smaller  a materials perspective
image of
on a clean    surface  as visualized using   the positions of the individual atoms composing the surface are visible 
main article 
several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases  these include
effects  as well as
effects  for example the   size effect  where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size  this effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions  however  quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached  typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less  the so-called   additionally  a number of physical  mechanical  electrical  optical  etc   properties change when compared to macroscopic systems  one example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical  thermal and catalytic properties of materials  diffusion and reactions at nanoscale  nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics  mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research  the catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with  
materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale  enabling unique applications  for instance  opaque substances can become transparent  copper   stable materials can turn combustible  aluminium   insoluble materials may become soluble  gold   a material such as gold  which is chemically inert at normal scales  can serve as a potent chemical
at nanoscales  much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale 
simple to complex  a molecular perspective
main article 
modern
has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure  these methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as
or commercial   this ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level  seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into
consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner 
these approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and or
to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a
approach  the concept of molecular recognition is especially important  molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to
  the watsoncrick
rules are a direct result of this  as is the specificity of an
being targeted to a single   or the specific
itself  thus  two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole 
such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods  but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases  most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms  nevertheless  there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in   most notably watsoncrick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions  the challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones 
molecular nanotechnology  a long-term view
main article 
molecular nanotechnology  sometimes called molecular manufacturing  describes engineered nanosystems  nanoscale machines  operating on the molecular scale  molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the   a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of   manufacturing in the context of
is not related to  and should be clearly distinguished from  the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles 
when the term  nanotechnology  was independently coined and popularized by
 who at the time was unaware of an
by norio taniguchi  it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on
systems  the premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible  by the countless examples found in biology  it is known that sophisticated 
optimised
can be produced 
it is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means  perhaps using
principles  however  drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology  although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means  ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles  namely  a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components  such as gears  bearings  motors  and structural members  that would enable programmable  positional assembly to atomic specification  the physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in drexler s book nanosystems 
in general it is very difficult to assemble devices on the atomic scale  as one has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness  another view  put forth by carlo montemagno  is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines  richard smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules 
this led to an exchange of letters in the
publication
in 2003  though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machine systems are possible  non-biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy  leaders in research on non-biological molecular machines are dr 
and his colleagues at lawrence berkeley laboratories and uc berkeley  they have constructed at least three distinct molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing voltage  a nanotube   a molecular actuator  and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator  see
for more examples 
an experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by ho and lee at
in 1999  they used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule  co  to an individual iron atom  fe  sitting on a flat silver crystal  and chemically bound the co to the fe by applying a voltage

nanomaterials
the nanomaterials field includes subfields which develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions 
has given rise to many materials which may be useful in nanotechnology  such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes  and various nanoparticles and   nanomaterials with fast ion transport are related also to nanoionics and nanoelectronics 
nanoscale materials can also be used for bulk applications  most present commercial applications of nanotechnology are of this flavor 
progress has been made in using these materials for medical applications  see  
nanoscale materials such as

solar cells

recent application of

applications  such as     and  
bottom-up approaches
these seek to arrange smaller components into more complex assemblies 
dna nanotechnology utilizes the specificity of watsoncrick basepairing to construct well-defined structures out of dna and other  
approaches from the field of  classical  chemical synthesis  inorganic and   also aim at designing molecules with well-defined shape  e g    
more generally  molecular self-assembly seeks to use concepts of supramolecular chemistry  and molecular recognition in particular  to cause single-molecule components to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation 
tips can be used as a nanoscale  write head  to deposit a chemical upon a surface in a desired pattern in a process called   this technique fits into the larger subfield of  
top-down approaches
these seek to create smaller devices by using larger ones to direct their assembly 
many technologies that descended from conventional
for fabricating
are now capable of creating features smaller than 100nm  falling under the definition of nanotechnology  -based hard drives already on the market fit this description  as do
 ald  techniques 
and
received the nobel prize in physics in 2007 for their discovery of giant magnetoresistance and contributions to the field of spintronics 
solid-state techniques can also be used to create devices known as
or nems  which are related to
or mems 
can directly remove material  or even deposit material when suitable precursor gasses are applied at the same time  for example  this technique is used routinely to create sub-100nm sections of material for analysis in  
atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale  write head  to deposit a resist  which is then followed by an etching process to remove material in a top-down method 
functional approaches
these seek to develop components of a desired functionality without regard to how they might be assembled 
for the synthesis of anisotropic superparamagnetic materials such as recently presented  
seeks to develop molecules with useful electronic properties  these could then be used as single-molecule components in a nanoelectronic device  for an example see rotaxane 
synthetic chemical methods can also be used to create   such as in a so-called

speculative
these subfields seek to
what inventions nanotechnology might yield  or attempt to propose an agenda along which inquiry might progress  these often take a big-picture view of nanotechnology  with more emphasis on its societal implications than the details of how such inventions could actually be created 
molecular nanotechnology is a proposed approach which involves manipulating single molecules in finely controlled  deterministic ways  this is more theoretical than the other subfields  and many of its proposed techniques are beyond current capabilities 
centers on self-sufficient machines of some functionality operating at the nanoscale  there are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine  but it may not be easy to do such a thing because of several drawbacks of such devices  nevertheless  progress on innovative materials and methodologies has been demonstrated with some patents granted about new nanomanufacturing devices for future commercial applications  which also progressively helps in the development towards nanorobots with the use of embedded nanobioelectronics concepts 
productive nanosystems are  systems of nanosystems  which will be complex nanosystems that produce atomically precise parts for other nanosystems  not necessarily using novel nanoscale-emergent properties  but well-understood fundamentals of manufacturing  because of the discrete  i e  atomic  nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth  this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution    one of the architects of the usa s national nanotechnology initiative  has proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the industrial revolution  progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex
and ultimately to productive nanosystems 
seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily  reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of
and  
due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology  the words
and
have been coined in analogy to it  although these are only used rarely and informally 
dimensionality in nanomaterials
nanomaterials can be classified in 0d  1d  2d and 3d   the dimensionality play a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including  
and
characteristics  with the decrease in dimensionality  an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed  this indicate that smaller dimensional
have higher surface area compared to 3d nanomaterials  recently 
are extensively investigated for    
and
applications 
tools and techniques
typical
setup  a microfabricated
with a sharp tip is deflected by features on a sample surface  much like in a
but on a much smaller scale  a
beam reflects off the backside of the cantilever into a set of   allowing the deflection to be measured and assembled into an image of the surface 
there are several important modern developments  the
 afm  and the
 stm  are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology  there are other types of   although conceptually similar to the scanning
developed by
in 1961 and the
 sam  developed by
and coworkers in the 1970s  newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution  since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light 
the tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures  a process called positional assembly  
methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode  however  this is still a slow process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope 
various techniques of nanolithography such as  
dip pen nanolithography 
or
were also developed  lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern 
another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of
and   those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography  electron beam lithography  focused ion beam machining  nanoimprint lithography  atomic layer deposition  and molecular vapor deposition  and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers  the precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era  and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research 
the top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages  much as manufactured items are made  scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials  atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around  by designing different tips for these microscopes  they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures  by using  for example  feature-oriented scanning approach  atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques  at present  it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation 
in contrast  bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule  these techniques include chemical synthesis 
and positional assembly 
is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films  another variation of the bottom-up approach is
or mbe  researchers at
like john r  arthur  alfred y  cho  and art c  gossard developed and implemented mbe as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s  samples made by mbe were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect for which the 1998 nobel prize in physics was awarded  mbe allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and  in the process  build up complex structures  important for research on semiconductors  mbe is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of

nanostructures provide this surface with   which lets

as of august 21  2008  the
estimates that over 800 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available  with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 34 per week  the project lists all of the products in a publicly accessible online database  most applications are limited to the use of  first generation  passive nanomaterials which includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen  cosmetics  surface coatings  and some food products  carbon allotropes used to produce   silver in food packaging  clothing  disinfectants and household appliances  zinc oxide in sunscreens and cosmetics  surface coatings  paints and outdoor furniture varnishes  and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst

and less
to operate in the future 
scientists are now turning to nanotechnology in an attempt to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes  platinum is currently used as the diesel engine
in these engines  the catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles  first a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from nox molecules in order to free oxygen  next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water  platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts  using platinum though  is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable  danish company innovationsfonden invested dkk 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology  the goal of the project  launched in the autumn of 2014  is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required  objects tend to minimize their surface energy  two drops of water  for example  will join to form one drop and decrease surface area  if the catalyst s surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized  efficiency of the catalyst is maximized  the team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge  every time the surface is optimized  material is saved  thus  creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalystin turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumesand will decrease cost  if successful  the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25  
nanotechnology also has a prominent role in the fast developing field of   when designing scaffolds  researchers attempt to the mimic the nanoscale features of a  s microenvironment to direct its differentiation down a suitable lineage  for example  when creating scaffolds to support the growth of bone  researchers may mimic
 
researchers have successfully used -based nanobots capable of carrying out logic functions to achieve targeted drug delivery in cockroaches  it is said that the computational power of these nanobots can be scaled up to that of a  
implications
main article 
an area of concern is the effect that industrial-scale manufacturing and use of nanomaterials would have on human health and the environment  as suggested by
research  for these reasons  some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments  others counter that overregulation would stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations 
research agencies  such as the
are actively conducting research on potential health effects stemming from exposures to nanoparticles 
some nanoparticle products may have   researchers have discovered that
silver nanoparticles used in socks to reduce foot odor are being released in the wash  these particles are then flushed into the waste water stream and may destroy bacteria which are critical components of natural ecosystems  farms  and waste treatment processes 
public deliberations on
in the us and uk carried out by the center for nanotechnology in society found that participants were more positive about nanotechnologies for energy applications than for health applications  with health applications raising moral and ethical dilemmas such as cost and availability 
experts  including director of the woodrow wilson center s project on emerging nanotechnologies david rejeski  have testified that successful commercialization depends on adequate oversight  risk research strategy  and public engagement 
is currently the only city in the united states to regulate nanotechnology 
in 2008 considered enacting a similar law  but ultimately rejected it  relevant for both research on and application of nanotechnologies  the
of nanotechnology is contested  without state   the availability of private insurance for potential damages is seen as necessary to ensure that burdens are not socialised implicitly

regulation
main article 
calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have occurred alongside a growing debate related to the human health and safety risks of nanotechnology  there is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology  some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology products and processes  to varying degrees   by  bolting on  nanotechnology to existing regulations  there are clear gaps in these regimes  davies  2008  has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings 
stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with
  mad cow  disease     genetically modified food  nuclear energy  reproductive technologies  biotechnology  and   dr  andrew maynard  chief science advisor to the woodrow wilson center s project on emerging nanotechnologies  concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research  and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology  as a result  some academics have called for stricter application of the   with delayed marketing approval  enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology 
the royal society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal  destruction and recycling  and recommended that  manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure   p  xiii  
the center for nanotechnology in society has found that people respond to nanotechnologies differently  depending on application  with participants in
more positive about nanotechnologies for energy than health applications  suggesting that any public calls for nano regulations may differ by technology sector
