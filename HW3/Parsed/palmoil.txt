palm oil  also known as dend oil  from portuguese  is an edible
derived from the
 reddish pulp  of the fruit of the   primarily the african oil palm   and to a lesser extent from the american oil palm
and the maripa palm  
palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high
content  it is not to be confused with
derived from the
of the same fruit  or
derived from the kernel of the coconut palm     the differences are in color  raw palm kernel oil lacks
and is not red   and in
content  palm mesocarp oil is 41  saturated  while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81  and 86  saturated fats  respectively 
along with coconut oil  palm oil is one of the few highly saturated
and is semi-solid at  
palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of  
and parts of   its use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is widespread because of its lower cost and the high oxidative stability    of the refined product when used for frying 
the use of palm oil in food products has attracted the concern of environmental activist groups  the high oil yield of the trees has encouraged wider cultivation  leading to the clearing of forests in parts of indonesia and malaysia in order to make space for oil-palm   this has resulted in significant acreage losses of the natural habitat of the   of which both species are endangered  one species in particular  the   has been listed as   in 2004  an industry group called the
 rspo  was formed to work with the palm oil industry to address these concerns  additionally  in 1992  in response to concerns about deforestation  the
pledged to limit the expansion of palm oil plantations by retaining a minimum of half the nation s land as forest cover

history  
 elaeis guineensis  
human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years  in the late 1800s  archaeologists discovered a substance that they concluded was originally palm oil in a tomb at
dating back to 3,000 bce  it is believed that arab traders brought the oil palm to egypt  some argue that it is not possible that arab traders could have brought the oil palm to ancient egypt  as the arabs did not settle in africa until the 8th century ce  it is more likely that the oil palm was brought to ancient egypt  kemet  by its founding peoples who migrated from other regions of the african continent 
palm oil from elaeis guineensiss has long been recognized in
and
countries  and is widely used as a   european merchants trading with west africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in  
palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by
traders  for use as an industrial
for machinery during britain s  
palm oil formed the basis of
products  such as    now      soap  and the american
brand 
by around 1870  palm oil constituted the primary export of some west african countries  such as
and   although this was overtaken by
in the 1880s

red palm oil  
since the mid-1990s  red palm oil has been
and bottled for use as cooking oil  and blended into
and  
butter and trans fat substitute  
the highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions  making it a cheap substitute for
or
in uses where solid fat is desirable  such as the making of
dough and baked goods  a recent rise in the use of palm oil in the food industry has partly come from changed labelling requirements that have caused a switch away from using trans fats  palm oil has been found to be a reasonable replacement for trans fats  however  a small study conducted in 2009 found that palm oil may not be a good substitute for trans fats for individuals with already-elevated ldl levels  the
agricultural research service states that palm oil is not a healthy substitute for  
biomass and bioenergy  
palm oil is used to produce both methyl ester and hydrodeoxygenated   palm oil methyl ester is created through a process called   palm oil biodiesel is often blended with other fuels to create palm oil biodiesel blends  palm oil biodiesel meets the european
standard for biodiesels  hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel is produced by direct
of the fat into alkanes and propane  the world s largest palm oil biodiesel plant is the finnish-operated
biodiesel plant in   which opened in 2011 and produces hydrodeoxygenated
biodiesel 
the organic waste matter that is produced when processing oil palm  including oil palm shells and oil palm fruit bunches  can also be used to produce energy  this waste material can be converted into pellets that can be used as a biofuel  additionally  palm oil that has been used to fry foods can be converted into methyl esters for biodiesel  the used cooking oil is chemically treated to create a biodiesel similar to petroleum diesel 
in wound care  
although palm oil is applied to wounds for its supposed
effects  research does not confirm its effectiveness 
production  
in 2012  the annual revenue received by indonesia and malaysia together  the top two producers of palm oil  was  40 billion  between 1962 and 1982 global exports of palm oil increased from around half a million to 2.4 million tonnes annually and in 2008 world production of palm oil and palm kernel oil amounted to 48 million tonnes  according to fao forecasts by 2020 the global demand for palm oil will double  and triple by 2050

in 2013  thailand produced 2.0 million tonnes of crude palm oil on roughly 626 thousand hectares  thailand expects to produce 11 million tonnes of fresh palm nuts in 2016  down from more than 12 million in 2015  the shortfall due to thailand s drought 
colombia  
in the 1960s  about 18,000 hectares  69sqmi  were planted with palm 
has now become the largest palm oil producer in the americas  and 35  of its product is exported as biofuel  in 2006  the colombian plantation owners  association  fedepalma  reported that oil palm cultivation was expanding to 1,000,000 hectares  3,900sqmi   this expansion is being funded  in part  by the
to resettle disarmed
members on arable land  and by the colombian government  which proposes to expand land use for exportable cash crops to 7,000,000 hectares  27,000sqmi  by 2020  including oil palms  fedepalma states that its members are following sustainable guidelines 
some afro-colombians claim that some of these new plantations have been expropriated from them after they had been driven away through poverty and civil war  while armed guards intimidate the remaining people to further depopulate the land  with

cameroon  
had a production project underway initiated by herakles farms in the us  however  the project was halted under the pressure of civil society organizations in cameroon  before the project was halted  herakles left the roundtable on sustainable palm oil early in negotiations  the project has been controversial due to opposition from villagers and the location of the project in a sensitive region for biodiversity 
kenya  
 s domestic production of edible oils covers about a third of its annual demand  estimated at around 380,000 metric tonnes  the rest is imported at a cost of around us 140 million a year  making edible oil the country s second most important import after petroleum  since 1993 a new
variety of cold-tolerant  high-yielding oil palm has been promoted by the
in western kenya  as well as alleviating the country s deficit of edible oils while providing an important cash crop  it is claimed to have environmental benefits in the region  because it does not compete against food crops or native vegetation and it provides stabilisation for the soil

according to the hamburg-based oil world trade journal    in 2008 global production of oils and fats stood at 160 million tonnes  palm oil and palm kernel oil were jointly the largest contributor  accounting for 48 million tonnes  or 30  of the total output 
came in second with 37 million tonnes  23    about 38  of the oils and fats produced in the world were shipped across oceans  of the 60.3 million tonnes of oils and fats exported around the world  palm oil and palm kernel oil made up close to 60     with 45  of the market share  dominated the palm oil trade 
food label regulations  
previously  palm oil could be listed as  vegetable fat  or  vegetable oil  on food labels in the
 eu   from december 2014  food packaging in the eu is no longer allowed to use the generic terms  vegetable fat  or  vegetable oil  in the ingredients list  food producers are required to list the specific type of vegetable fat used  including palm oil  vegetable oils and fats can be grouped together in the ingredients list under the term  vegetable oils  or  vegetable fats  but this must be followed by the type of vegetable origin  e g  palm  sunflower or rapeseed  and the phrase  in varying proportions  
supply chain institutions  
the roundtable on sustainable palm oil  rspo  was established in 2004 following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts resulting from palm oil production  the organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production  products containing certified sustainable palm oil  cspo  can carry the rspo trademark  members of the rspo include palm oil producers  environmental groups  and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products 
the rspo is applying different types of programmes to supply palm oil to producers 
book and claim  no guarantee that the end product contains certified sustainable palm oil  supports rspo-certified growers and farmers
identity preserved  the end user is able to trace the palm oil back to a specific single mill and its supply base  plantations 
segregated  this option guarantees that the end product contains certified palm oil
mass balance  the refinery is only allowed to sell the same amount of mass balance palm oil as the amount of certified sustainable palm oil purchased
is one of the retailers executing the book and claim supply chain and trading programme  it guarantees that the palm oil producer is certified by the rspo  through greenpalm the producer can certify a specified amount with the greenpalm logo  the buyer of the oil is allowed to use the rspo and the greenpalm label for sustainable palm oil on his products 
nutrition and health  
palm oil is also an important source of calories and a food staple in poor communities  however its overall health impacts  particularly in relation to cardiovascular disease  are controversial and subject to ongoing research 
much of the palm oil that is consumed as food is   to some degree oxidized rather than in the fresh state  and this oxidation appears to be responsible for the health risk associated with consuming palm oil 
cardiovascular disease  
several studies have linked palm oil to higher risks of
including a 2005 study conducted in costa rica which indicated that replacing palm oil in cooking with polyunsaturated non-hydrogenated oils could reduce the risk of heart attacks  and a 2011 analysis of 23 countries which showed that for each kilogram of palm oil added to the diet annually there was an increase in
deaths  68 deaths per 100,000 increase  though the increase was much smaller in high-income countries 
palmitic acid  
according to studies reported on by the
 cspi   excessive intake of   which makes up 44 percent of palm oil  increases blood cholesterol levels and may contribute to   the cspi also reported that the
and the us
have encouraged consumers to limit the consumption of palmitic acid and foods high in saturated fat  according to the   evidence is convincing that consumption of palmitic acid increases risk of developing cardiovascular diseases  placing it in the same evidence category as  
comparison to trans fats  
in response to negative reports on palm oil many food manufacturers transitioned to using hydrogenated vegetable oils in their products  which have also come under scrutiny for the impact these oils have on health  a 2006 study supported by the
and the usda
concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats    in the food industry  because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of ldl cholesterol and
just as trans fat does  however  according to two reports published in 2010 by the journal of the
palm oil is again an accepted replacement for hydrogenated vegetable oils and a natural replacement for partially hydrogenated vegetable oils  which are a significant source of trans fats 
comparison with animal saturated fat  
not all saturated fats have equally cholesterolemic effects  studies have indicated that consumption of palm olein  which is more unsaturated  reduces blood cholesterol when compared to sources of saturated fats like   dairy and animal fats 
acrolein  
a 2009 study tested the emission rates of   a toxic and malodorous breakdown product from   from the deep-frying of potatoes in red palm  olive  and polyunsaturated sunflower oils  the study found higher acrolein emission rates from the polyunsaturated sunflower oil  the scientists characterized red palm oil as  mono-unsaturated   and lower rates from both palm and olive oils  the
established a tolerable oral acrolein intake of 7.5mg day per kilogram of body weight  although acrolein occurs in   the levels are only a few micrograms per kilogram  a 2011 study concluded a health risk from acrolein in food is unlikely

the palm oil industry has had both positive and negative impacts on workers 
and residents of palm oil-producing communities  palm oil production provides employment opportunities  and has been shown to improve   social services and reduce poverty  however  in some cases  oil palm plantations have developed lands without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land  resulting in social conflict  the use of
in malaysia has also raised concerns about working conditions within the palm oil industry 
some social initiatives use palm oil cultivation as part of poverty alleviation strategies  examples include the un food and agriculture organisation s hybrid oil palm project in western   which improves incomes and diets of local populations  and malaysia s
and federal land consolidation and rehabilitation authority  which both support rural development 
food vs  fuel  
main article 
the use of palm oil in the production of biodiesel has led to concerns that the need for fuel is being placed ahead of the need for food  leading to malnourishment in developing nations  this is known as the
debate  according to a 2008 report published in the   palm oil was determined to be a sustainable source of both food and biofuel  the production of palm oil biodiesel does not pose a threat to edible palm oil supplies  according to a 2009 study published in the environmental science and policy journal  palm oil biodiesel might increase the demand for palm oil in the future  resulting in the expansion of palm oil production  and therefore an increased supply of food

palm oil cultivation has been criticized for impacts on the natural environment  including   loss of natural habitats  which has threatened
such as the
and   and increased
emissions  many palm oil plantations are built on top of existing peat bogs  and clearing the land for palm oil cultivation contributes to rising greenhouse gas emissions 
efforts to portray palm oil cultivation as sustainable have been made by organizations including the   an industry group  and the malaysian government  which has committed to preserve 50 percent of its total land area as forest  according to research conducted by the tropical peat research laboratory  a group studying palm oil cultivation in support of the industry  oil palm plantations act as   converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and  according to malaysia s second national communication to the   the plantations contribute to malaysia s status as a net carbon sink 
environmental groups such as

roundtable on sustainable palm oil  rspo   
main article 
roundtable no 2  rt2  in zurich in 2005 
the roundtable on sustainable palm oil  rspo  was created in 2004 following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts related to palm oil production  the organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production  products containing certified sustainable palm oil  cspo  can carry the rspo trademark  members of the rspo include palm oil producers  environmental groups and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products 
palm oil growers who produce certified sustainable palm oil have been critical of the organization because  though they have met rspo standards and assumed the costs associated with certification  the market demand for certified palm oil remains low  low market demand has been attributed to the higher cost of certified sustainable palm oil  leading palm oil buyers to purchase cheaper non-certified palm oil  palm oil is mostly   in 2011  12  of palm oil produced was certified  sustainable   though only half of that had the rspo label  even with such a low proportion being certified 
has argued that confectioners are avoiding responsibilities on sustainable palm oil  because it says that rspo standards fall short of protecting rain forests and reducing greenhouse gases
