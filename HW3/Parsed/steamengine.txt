early experiments  
the history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century ad  the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the
described by
mathematician   in the following centuries  the few steam-powered  engines  known were  like the aeolipile  essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of   a rudimentary
device was described by
in 1551 and by
in 1629 
received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions  including a water pump for draining inundated mines    a
refugee  did some useful work on the
in 1679  and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690 
pumping engines  
the first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump  developed in 1698 by   it used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below  then it used steam pressure to raise it higher  small engines were effective though larger models were problematic  they proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to   it received some use in mines 
and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery  an attractive feature of the savery engine was its low cost 
introduced an ingenious improvement of savery s construction  to render it capable of working itself   as described by
in the philosophical transactions published in 1751  it continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century  one engine was still known to be operating in 1820 
piston steam engines  
steam engine 1720
the first commercially successful true engine  in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine  was the   invented by
around 1712  it was an improvement over savery s steam pump  using a piston as proposed by papin  newcomen s engine was relatively inefficient  and in most cases was used for pumping water  it worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder  it was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible  and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving
at factories sited away from a suitable  head   water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel 
in 1720
described a two-cylinder high-pressure steam engine  the invention was published in his major work  theatri machinarum hydraulicarum   the engine used two heavy pistons to provide motion to a water pump  each piston was raised by the steam pressure and returned to its original position by gravity  the two pistons shared a common four way

watt proceeded to develop his engine further  modifying it to provide a rotary motion suitable for driving factory machinery  this enabled factories to be sited away from rivers  and further accelerated the pace of the industrial revolution 
high-pressure engines  
watt s patent prevented others from making high pressure and compound engines  shortly after watt s patent expired in 1800 
and  separately 
in 1801 introduced engines using high-pressure steam  trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802  and evans had made several working models before then  these were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications  thereafter  technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques  partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source  resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller  faster  or more powerful  depending on the intended application 
the
was developed by trevithick and others in the 1810s  it was a compound cycle engine that used high-pressure steam expansively  then condensed the low-pressure steam  making it relatively efficient  the cornish engine had irregular motion and torque though the cycle  limiting it mainly to pumping  cornish engines were used in mines and for water supply until the late 19th century 
horizontal stationary engine  
main article 
early builders of stationary steam engines considered that horizontal cylinders would be subject to excessive wear  their engines were therefore arranged with the piston axis vertical  in time the horizontal arrangement became more popular  allowing compact  but powerful engines to be fitted in smaller spaces 
the acme of the horizontal engine was the   patented in 1849  which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff  when corliss was given the   the committee said that  no one invention since watt s time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine   in addition to using 30  less steam  it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off  making it well suited to manufacturing  especially cotton spinning 
road vehicles  
main article 
the first experimental road going steam powered vehicles were built in the late 18th century  but it was not until after
had developed the use of high-pressure steam  around 1800  that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition  the first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design  and by the 1850s it was becoming viable to produce them on a commercial basis  this progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam powered vehicles on roads  improvements in vehicle technology continued from the 1860s to the 1920s  steam road vehicles were used for many applications  in the 20th century  the rapid development of
technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis  with relatively few remaining in use beyond the   many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation  and numerous examples are still in existence  in the 1960s the air pollution problems in california gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution  apart from interest by steam enthusiasts  the occasional replica vehicle  and experimental technology no steam vehicles are in production at present

steam locomotives  
main articles 
and
as the development of steam engines progressed through the 18th century  various attempts were made to apply them to road and railway use  in 1784    a
inventor  built a prototype steam road locomotive  an early working model of a steam rail locomotive was designed and constructed by steamboat pioneer
in the united states probably during the 1780s or 1790s  his steam locomotive used interior bladed wheels guided by rails or tracks 
the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by
in the
and  on 21 february 1804  the world s first railway journey took place as trevithick s unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the

ironworks  near
to
in south   the design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency  trevithick visited the newcastle area later in 1804 and the
in north-east england became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives 
trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives  concluding with the

steam turbines  
main article 
the final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam
starting in the late part of the 19th century  steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines  for outputs above several hundred horsepower   have fewer moving parts  and provide rotary power directly instead of through a
system or similar means  steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century  where their efficiency  higher speed appropriate to generator service  and smooth rotation were advantages  today most
is provided by steam turbines  in the united states 90  of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources  steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century 
present development  
main article 
although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use  various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines  the company energiprojekt ab in
has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam  the efficiency of energiprojekt s steam engine reaches some 27-30  on high-pressure engines  it is a single-step  5-cylinder engine  no compound  with superheated steam and consumes approx  4kg  8.8lb  of steam per kwh   
components and accessories of steam engines  
there are two fundamental components of a steam plant  the
or   and the  motor unit   referred to itself as a  steam engine  
in fixed buildings may have the boiler and engine in separate buildings some distance apart  for portable or mobile use  such as   the two are mounted together 
the widely used reciprocating engine typically consisted of a cast iron cylinder  piston  connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel  and miscellaneous linkages  steam was alternately supplied and exhausted by one or more valves  speed control was either automatic  using a governor  or by a manual valve  the cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports 
engines equipped with a condenser are a separate type than those that exhaust to the atmosphere 
other components are often present  pumps  such as an   to supply water to the boiler during operation  condensers to recirculate the water and recover the
of vaporisation  and
to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point  and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes  when coal is used  a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin  bunker  to the firebox  see 
heat source  
the heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources  most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space  called variously      in some cases the heat source is a  
energy 
or waste heat from an
or industrial process  in the case of model or toy steam engines  the heat source can be an electric heating element 
boilers  
main article 
an industrial boiler used for a
boilers are
that contain water to be boiled  and some kind of mechanism for
so as to boil it 
the two most common methods of transferring heat to the water are 
 water is contained in or run through one or several tubes surrounded by hot gases
 the water partially fills a vessel below or inside which is a combustion chamber or furnace and fire tubes through which the hot gases flow
fire tube boilers were the main type used for early high-pressure steam  typical steam locomotive practice   but they were to a large extent displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications 
once turned to steam  many boilers raise the temperature of the steam further  turning    into     this use of
avoids the steam condensing within the engine  and allows significantly greater  
motor units  
for more details on this topic  see  
in a steam engine  a piston or steam turbine or any other similar device for doing mechanical work takes a supply of steam at high pressure and temperature and gives out a supply of steam at lower pressure and temperature  using as much of the difference in steam energy as possible to do mechanical work 
these  motor units  are often called  steam engines  in their own right  they will also operate on
or other gas 
cold sink  
a power station s
produces clouds from the condensing water vapor due to evaporated cooling water 
as with all heat engines  the majority of
must be emitted as
at relatively low temperature 
the simplest cold sink is to vent the steam to the environment  this is often used on   as the released steam is vented up the chimney so as to increase the draw on the fire  which greatly increases engine power  but reduces efficiency 
sometimes the waste heat is useful itself  and in those cases very high overall efficiency can be obtained  for example 
 chp  systems use the waste steam for   exceeding 80  combined efficiency 
where chp is not used  steam turbines in stationary power plants use
as a cold sink  the condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans  rivers  lakes  and often by
which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal  the resulting condensed hot water  is then pumped back up to pressure and sent back to the boiler  a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly  waste heat can also be ejected by evaporative  wet  cooling towers use pass the rejected to external water cycle that evaporates some of flow to the air    cooling towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air  evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than  once-through  cooling by river or lake water  a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling  but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water  evaporative water cannot be used for subsequent purposes  other than rain somewhere   whereas river water can be re-used  in all cases  the steam plant water  which must be kept pure  is kept separate from the cooling water or air  and once the low pressure steam condenses into water  it is returned to the boiler 
an
uses a jet of steam to force water into the boiler  injectors are inefficient but simple enough to be suitable for use on locomotives 
water pump  
the rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water  so that they may be run continuously  utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage   however  other types are used  another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an   which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler  injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used  except in applications such as steam locomotives  it is the pressurization of the water that circulates through the steam boiler that allows the water to be raised to temperatures well above 100 c boiling point of water at one atmospheric pressure  and by that means to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle 
monitoring and control  
richard s indicator instrument of 1875  see  indicator diagram  below 
for safety reasons  nearly all steam engines are equipped with mechanisms to monitor the boiler  such as a
and a
to monitor the water level 
many engines  stationary and mobile  are also fitted with a
to regulate the speed of the engine without the need for human interference 
the most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator  early versions were in use by 1851  but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer charles porter by charles richard and exhibited at london exhibition in 1862  the steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle  which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower  it was routinely used by engineers  mechanics and insurance inspectors  the engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines  see image of indicator diagram below  in types of motor units section

governor  
main article 
the
was adopted by james watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after watts partner boulton saw one on the equipment of a flour mill
were building  the governor could not actually hold a set speed  because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes  the governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler  also  there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change  as a consequence  engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed  such as cotton spinning  the governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off  good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century 
engine configuration  
simple engine  
in a simple engine  the charge of steam passes through only one cylinder  it is then exhausted directly into the atmosphere or into a condenser  as steam expands in passing through a high-pressure engine  its temperature drops because no heat is being added to the system  this is known as
and results in steam entering the cylinder at high temperature and leaving at lower temperature  this causes a cycle of heating and cooling of the cylinder with every stroke  which is a source of inefficiency 
as the stroke of a single cylinder engine is increased in an effort to extract more work from the steam with each stroke  a greater amount of cylinder wall is exposed and more heat is lost  resulting in decreased efficiency of a long stroke engine 
compound engines  
main article 
a method to lessen the magnitude of energy loss to a very long cylinder was invented in 1804 by british engineer   who patented his woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805  in the compound engine  high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure  hp  cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure  lp  cylinders  the complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less cylinder wall is exposed  per unit volume of steam in each cylinder  less heat is lost by the steam in each  this reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling  increasing the efficiency of the engine  by staging the expansion in multiple cylinders  variations of torque can be reduced  to derive equal work from lower-pressure cylinder requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume  therefore  the bore  and often the stroke  are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders 
double expansion  usually known as compound  engines expanded the steam in two stages  the pairs may be duplicated or the work of the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other  giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and piston diameter are about the same making the reciprocating masses easier to balance 
two-cylinder compounds can be arranged as 
cross compounds  the cylinders are side by side 
tandem compounds  the cylinders are end to end  driving a common
angle compounds  the cylinders are arranged in a v  usually at a 90 angle  and drive a common crank 
with two-cylinder compounds used in railway work  the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90 out of phase with each other  quartered   when the double expansion group is duplicated  producing a four-cylinder compound  the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180  the groups being set at 90 to each other  in one case  the first type of    the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank  again set at 90 as for a two-cylinder engine  with the three-cylinder compound arrangement  the lp cranks were either set at 90 with the hp one at 135 to the other two  or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120   
the adoption of compounding was common for industrial units  for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880  it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated  this is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the
 particularly in britain  where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930   however  although never in the majority  it was popular in many other countries 
multiple expansion engines  
main article 
an animation of a simplified triple-expansion engine 
high-pressure steam  red  enters from the boiler and passes through the engine  exhausting as low-pressure steam  blue   usually to a condenser 
it is a logical extension of the compound engine  described above  to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency  the result is the multiple expansion engine  such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively  these engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter  these cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage  as with the double expansion engine  if space is at a premium  then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage  multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline  but various other formations were used  in the late 19th century  the yarrow-schlick-tweedy balancing  system  was used on some   y-s-t engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders  one at each end of the engine  this allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced  resulting in a smoother  faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration  this made the four-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners  such as the    but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free    
the image to the right shows an animation of a triple expansion engine  the steam travels through the engine from left to right  the valve chest for each of the cylinders is to the left of the corresponding cylinder 
land-based steam engines could exhaust much of their steam  as feed water was usually readily available  prior to and during   the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential  it was however superseded by the british invention
where speed was required  for instance in warships  such as the   and  
of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine

reciprocating piston  
stationary engine  this was the common mill engine of the mid 19th century  note the
with concave  almost  d  shaped  underside 
schematic
showing the four events in a double piston stroke  see  monitoring and control  above 
main article 
in most reciprocating piston engines  the steam reverses its direction of flow at each
 counterflow   entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port  the complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes  the cycle also comprises four events  admission  expansion  exhaust  compression  these events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder  the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end s  and are driven by   of which there are many types   
the simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction  most however have a reversing
which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually  shortening the   or rather  shortening the admission event  this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period  however  as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows  a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant  if the exhaust event is too brief  the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder  choking it and giving excessive compression   kick back     
in the 1840s and 50s  there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate  variable cutoff
riding on the back of the main slide valve  the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff  the combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events  at the expense of increased friction and wear  and the mechanism tended to be complicated  the usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side  with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred  this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler  
and
motions    and later 
gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by
or
profiled so as to give ideal events  most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms 
compression
before the exhaust phase is quite complete  the exhaust side of the valve closes  shutting a portion of the exhaust steam inside the cylinder  this determines the compression phase where a cushion of steam is formed against which the piston does work whilst its velocity is rapidly decreasing  it moreover obviates the pressure and temperature shock  which would otherwise be caused by the sudden admission of the high-pressure steam at the beginning of the following cycle   
lead
the above effects are further enhanced by providing lead  as was later discovered with the   it has been found advantageous since the late 1830s to advance the admission phase  giving the valve lead so that admission occurs a little before the end of the exhaust stroke in order to fill the clearance volume comprising the ports and the cylinder ends  not part of the piston-swept volume  before the steam begins to exert effort on the piston

main article 
uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where  during each stroke  the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam  whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature  the aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction  by this means  the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance  and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower  however  the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties     the quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas  while exhausting in cold areas 
turbine engines  
a rotor of a modern   used in a
main article 
a steam turbine consists of one or more
 rotating discs  mounted on a drive shaft  alternating with a series of
 static discs  fixed to the turbine casing  the rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge  steam acts upon these blades  producing rotary motion  the stator consists of a similar  but fixed  series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage  a steam turbine often exhausts into a
that provides a vacuum  the stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam  giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages  turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed  therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications  such as a ship s propeller  in the vast majority of large electric generating stations  turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing  typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute  rpm  in the usa with 60 hertz power  and 3000 rpm in europe and other countries with 50 hertz electric power systems  in nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds  1800 rpm and 1500 rpm  a turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction  therefore  a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction 
steam turbines provide direct rotational force and therefore do not require a linkage mechanism to convert reciprocating to rotary motion  thus  they produce smoother rotational forces on the output shaft  this contributes to a lower maintenance requirement and less wear on the machinery they power than a comparable reciprocating engine

 in the 1990s about 90  of the world s electric production was by use of steam turbines  however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80  regime for steam turbines  in electricity production  the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators  which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines  in marine service   pioneered on the    steam turbines with reduction gearing  although the turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox  dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century  being more efficient  and requiring far less maintenance  than reciprocating steam engines  in recent decades  reciprocating diesel engines  and gas turbines  have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications 
virtually all
plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an  
either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion  with generators providing auxiliary power  or else employ   where the steam drives a
set with propulsion provided by electric motors  a limited number of
were manufactured  some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in
and for   but were not repeated  elsewhere  notably in the u s a   more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally  but not reproduced  it was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done   
operation of a simple
oscillating cylinder steam engines  
main article 
an oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require
to direct steam into and out of the cylinder  instead of valves  the entire cylinder rocks  or oscillates  such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting     these engines are mainly used in toys and models  because of their simplicity  but have also been used in full size working engines  mainly on
where their compactness is valued   
rotary steam engines  
it is possible to use a mechanism based on a
such as the
in place of the cylinders and
of a conventional reciprocating steam engine  many such engines have been designed  from the time of james watt to the present day  but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production  see link at bottom of article for more details  the major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and   the resulting leakage made them very inefficient  lack of expansive working  or any means of control of the
is also a serious problem with many such designs   
by the 1840s  it was clear that the concept had inherent problems and rotary engines were treated with some derision in the technical press  however  the arrival of electricity on the scene  and the obvious advantages of driving a dynamo directly from a high-speed engine  led to something of a revival in interest in the 1880s and 1890s  and a few designs had some limited success     the
is a new type of uniflow rotary steam engine 
of the few designs that were manufactured in quantity  those of the hult brothers rotary steam engine company of stockholm  sweden  and the spherical engine of
are notable  tower s engines were used by the
to drive lighting dynamos on their locomotives  and by the
for driving dynamos on board the ships of the   they were eventually replaced in these niche applications by steam turbines   
an
rotates due to the steam escaping from the arms  no practical use was made of this effect 
rocket type  
main article 
the
represents the use of steam by the rocket-reaction principle  although not for direct propulsion 
in more modern times there has been limited use of steam for rocketry  particularly for rocket cars  steam rocketry works by filling a pressure vessel with hot water at high pressure and opening a valve leading to a suitable nozzle  the drop in pressure immediately boils some of the water and the steam leaves through a nozzle  creating a propulsive force 
safety  
steam engines possess boilers and other components that are
that contain a great deal of potential energy  steam escapes and
 typically   can and have in the past caused great loss of life  while variations in standards may exist in different countries  stringent legal  testing  training  care with manufacture  operation and certification is applied to ensure safety 
failure modes may include 
over-pressurisation of the boiler
insufficient water in the boiler causing overheating and vessel failure
buildup of sediment and scale which cause local hot spots  especially in riverboats using dirty feed water
pressure vessel failure of the boiler due to inadequate construction or maintenance 
escape of steam from pipework boiler causing scalding
steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high  one may be adjusted by the user  the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe  such
traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler  one end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure  early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers  leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine  the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve  which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken  this arrangement is considerably safer   
lead
may be present in the crown of the boiler s firebox  if the water level drops  such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly  the
melts and the steam escapes  warning the operators  who may then manually suppress the fire  except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire  the plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly  depressurizing the boiler  if they were any larger  the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew

the rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine  the cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production  and utilizes the phase change of water  boiling water producing steam  condensing exhaust steam  producing liquid water   to provide a practical heat power conversion system  the heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser  the rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications  in the 1990s  rankine steam cycles generated about 90  of all electric power used throughout the world  including virtually all    
and
  it is named after   a scottish  
the rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical
because  when an efficient turbine is used  the
begins to resemble the carnot cycle  the main difference is that heat addition  in the boiler  and rejection  in the condenser  are
 constant pressure  processes in the rankine cycle and
 constant   processes in the theoretical carnot cycle  in this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas  pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor  as in the    the cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages 
the working fluid in a rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system  where the working fluid is recycled continuously  or may be an  open loop  system  where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere  and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied  normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties  such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry  abundance  low cost  and its  
is the working fluid in the   low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a  
the steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory  however  the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam  the experimental measurements made by watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser  watt independently discovered   which was confirmed by the original discoverer   who also advised watt on experimental procedures  watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure  otherwise  the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature  the thermodynamic concepts of the rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine 
efficiency  
main article 
see also 
the efficiency of an engine can be calculated by dividing the energy output of mechanical work that the engine produces by the energy input to the engine by the burning fuel 
the historical measure of a steam engine s energy efficiency was its  duty   the concept of duty was first introduced by watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier newcomen designs  duty is the number of
of
delivered by burning one
 94 pounds  of coal  the best examples of newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million  but most were closer to 5 million  watt s original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million  but averaged about 17  this was a three-fold improvement over the average newcomen design  early watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million 
no heat engine can be more efficient than the   in which heat is moved from a high temperature reservoir to one at a low temperature  and the efficiency depends on the temperature difference  for the greatest efficiency  steam engines should be operated at the highest steam temperature possible     and release the waste heat at the lowest temperature possible 
the efficiency of a rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid  without the pressure reaching
levels for the working fluid  the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small  in steam turbines  turbine entry temperatures are typically 565c  the
limit of stainless steel  and condenser temperatures are around 30c  this gives a theoretical
of about 63  compared with an actual efficiency of 42  for a modern coal-fired power station  this low turbine entry temperature  compared with a   is why the rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in
power stations   
one of the principal advantages the rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump  the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point  by condensing the fluid  the work required by the pump consumes only 1  to 3  of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle  the benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature    for instance  have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500c  nonetheless  the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched   
in practice  a steam engine exhausting the steam to atmosphere will typically have an efficiency  including the boiler  in the range of 1-10   but with the addition of a condenser and multiple expansion  and high steam pressure temperature  it may be greatly improved  historically into the regime of 10-20   and very rarely slightly higher 
a modern large electrical power station  producing several hundred megawatts of electrical output  with  
etc  will achieve efficiency in the mid 40  range  with the most efficient units approaching 50  thermal efficiency 
it is also possible to capture the waste heat using
in which the waste heat is used for heating a lower boiling point working fluid or as a heat source for district heating via saturated low-pressure steam
