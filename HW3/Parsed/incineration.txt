incineration is a
that involves the
of
substances contained in waste materials  incineration and other high-temperature waste treatment systems are described as     incineration of waste materials converts the waste into     and heat  the ash is mostly formed by the
constituents of the waste  and may take the form of solid lumps or
carried by the flue gas  the flue gases must be cleaned of gaseous and particulate pollutants before they are dispersed into the   in some cases  the heat generated by incineration can be used to generate  
incineration with energy recovery is one of several
 wte  technologies such as  
and   while incineration and gasification technologies are similar in principle  the energy product from incineration is high-temperature heat whereas combustible gas is often the main energy product from gasification  incineration and gasification may also be implemented without energy and materials recovery 
in several countries  there are still concerns from experts and local communities about the environmental effect of incinerators  see   
in some countries  incinerators built just a few decades ago often did not include a
to remove hazardous 
or
materials before combustion  these facilities tended to risk the health of the plant workers and the local environment due to inadequate levels of gas cleaning and combustion process control  most of these facilities did not generate electricity 
incinerators reduce the solid mass of the original waste by 8085  and the volume  already compressed somewhat in   by 9596   depending on composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling  this means that while incineration does not completely replace   it significantly reduces the necessary volume for disposal 
often reduce the volume of waste in a built-in compressor before delivery to the incinerator  alternatively  at landfills  the volume of the uncompressed garbage can be reduced by approximately 70    by using a stationary steel compressor  albeit with a significant energy cost  in many countries  simpler
is a common practice for compaction at landfills 
incineration has particularly strong benefits for the treatment of certain
in
areas such as
and certain
where
and
can be destroyed by high temperatures  examples include chemical multi-product plants with diverse toxic or very toxic wastewater streams  which cannot be routed to a conventional wastewater treatment plant 
waste combustion is particularly popular in countries such as japan where land is a scarce resource  denmark and sweden have been leaders in using the energy generated from incineration for more than a century  in localised
facilities supporting
schemes  in 2005  waste incineration produced 4.8  of the electricity consumption and 13.7  of the total domestic heat consumption in denmark  a number of other european countries rely heavily on incineration for handling municipal waste  in particular   the netherlands  germany  and france

technology  
an incinerator is a
for burning   modern incinerators include pollution mitigation equipment such as
gas cleaning  there are various types of incinerator plant design  moving grate  fixed grate  rotary-kiln  and fluidised bed   
burn pile  
the
is one of the simplest and earliest forms of waste disposal  essentially consisting of a mound of combustible materials piled on open ground and set on fire 
a typical small burn pile in a garden 
burn piles can and have spread uncontrolled fires  for example if wind blows burning material off the pile into surrounding combustible grasses or onto buildings  as interior structures of the pile are consumed  the pile can shift and collapse  spreading the burn area  even in a situation of no wind  small lightweight ignited embers can lift off the pile via   and waft through the air into grasses or onto buildings  igniting them   
burn barrel  
the burn barrel is a somewhat more controlled form of private waste incineration  containing the burning material inside a metal barrel  with a metal grating over the exhaust  the barrel prevents the spread of burning material in windy conditions  and as the combustibles are reduced they can only settle down into the barrel  the exhaust grating helps to prevent the spread of burning embers  typically steel 55-us-gallon  210l  drums are used as burn barrels  with air vent holes cut or drilled around the base for air intake  over time  the very high heat of incineration causes the metal to oxidize and rust  and eventually the barrel itself is consumed by the heat and must be replaced 
private burning of dry cellulosic paper products is generally clean-burning  producing no visible smoke  but plastics in household waste can cause private burning to create a public nuisance  generating acrid odors and fumes that make eyes burn and water  most urban communities ban burn barrels  and certain rural communities may have prohibitions on open burning  especially those home to many residents not familiar with this common rural practice   
as of 2006 in the united states  private rural household or farm waste incineration of small quantities was typically permitted so long as it is not a nuisance to others  does not pose a risk of fire such as in dry conditions  and the fire does not produce dense  noxious smoke  a handful of states  such as new york  minnesota  and wisconsin  have laws or regulations either banning or strictly regulating open burning due to health and nuisance effects  people intending to burn waste may be required to contact a state agency in advance to check current fire risk and conditions  and to alert officials of the controlled fire that will occur

the typical incineration plant for
is a moving grate incinerator  the moving grate enables the movement of waste through the combustion chamber to be optimised to allow a more efficient and complete combustion  a single moving grate boiler can handle up to 35 metric tons  39 short tons  of waste per hour  and can operate 8,000hours per year with only one scheduled stop for inspection and maintenance of about one month s duration  moving grate incinerators are sometimes referred to as municipal solid waste incinerators  mswis  
the waste is introduced by a
through the  throat  at one end of the grate  from where it moves down over the descending grate to the ash pit in the other end  here the ash is removed through a water lock 
municipal solid waste in the furnace of a moving grate incinerator capable of handling 15 metric tons  17 short tons  of waste per hour  the holes in the grate elements supplying the primary combustion air are visible 
part of the combustion air  primary combustion air  is supplied through the grate from below  this air flow also has the purpose of cooling the grate itself  cooling is important for the mechanical strength of the grate  and many moving grates are also water-cooled internally 
secondary combustion air is supplied into the boiler at high speed through nozzles over the grate  it facilitates complete combustion of the flue gases by introducing
for better mixing and by ensuring a surplus of oxygen  in multiple stepped hearth incinerators  the secondary combustion air is introduced in a separate chamber downstream the primary combustion chamber 
according to the european   incineration plants must be designed to ensure that the
reach a temperature of at least 850c  1,560f  for 2seconds in order to ensure proper breakdown of toxic organic substances  in order to comply with this at all times  it is required to install backup auxiliary burners  often fueled by oil   which are fired into the boiler in case the
of the waste becomes too low to reach this temperature alone 
the
are then cooled in the   where the heat is transferred to steam  heating the steam to typically 400c  752f  at a pressure of 40
 580  for the electricity generation in the   at this point  the flue gas has a temperature of around 200c  392f   and is passed to the  
in   scheduled maintenance is always performed during summer  where the demand for
is low  often  incineration plants consist of several separate  boiler lines   boilers and flue gas treatment plants   so that waste can continue to be received at one boiler line while the others are undergoing maintenance  repair  or upgrading 
fixed grate  
the older and simpler kind of incinerator was a brick-lined cell with a fixed metal grate over a lower ash pit  with one opening in the top or side for loading and another opening in the side for removing incombustible solids called   many small incinerators formerly found in apartment houses have now been replaced by    
rotary-kiln  
the
incinerator is used by municipalities and by large industrial plants  this design of incinerator has 2 chambers  a primary chamber and secondary chamber  the primary chamber in a rotary kiln incinerator consist of an inclined refractory lined cylindrical tube  the inner refractory lining serves as sacrificial layer to protect the kiln structure  this refractory layer needs to be replaced from time to time  movement of the cylinder on its axis facilitates movement of waste  in the primary chamber  there is conversion of solid fraction to gases  through volatilization  destructive distillation and partial combustion reactions  the secondary chamber is necessary to complete gas phase combustion reactions 
the clinkers spill out at the end of the cylinder  a tall flue-gas stack  fan  or steam jet supplies the needed   ash drops through the grate  but many particles are carried along with the hot gases  the particles and any combustible gases may be combusted in an  afterburner  
fluidized bed  
a strong airflow is forced through a sandbed  the air seeps through the sand until a point is reached where the sand particles separate to let the air through and mixing and churning occurs  thus a
is created and fuel and waste can now be introduced  the sand with the pre-treated waste and or fuel is kept suspended on pumped air currents and takes on a fluid-like character  the bed is thereby violently mixed and agitated keeping small inert particles and air in a fluid-like state  this allows all of the mass of waste  fuel and sand to be fully circulated through the furnace   
specialized incineration  
furniture factory sawdust incinerators need much attention as these have to handle resin powder and many flammable substances  controlled combustion  burn back prevention systems are essential as dust when suspended resembles the fire catch phenomenon of any liquid petroleum gas 
use of heat  
the heat produced by an incinerator can be used to generate steam which may then be used to drive a
in order to produce electricity  the typical amount of net energy that can be produced per tonne municipal waste is about 2/3mwh of electricity and 2mwh of district heating  thus  incinerating about 600 metric tons  660 short tons  per day of waste will produce about 400 mwh of electrical energy per day  17 of electrical power continuously for 24 hours  and 1200mwh of district heating energy each day 
pollution  
incineration has a number of outputs such as the ash and the emission to the atmosphere of   before the   if installed  the flue gases may contain           and   if plants have inadequate flue gas cleaning  these outputs may add a significant pollution component to stack emissions 
in a study from 1997  delaware solid waste authority found that  for same amount of produced energy  incineration plants emitted fewer particles  hydrocarbons and less so2  hcl  co and nox than coal-fired power plants  but more than natural gasfired power plants  according to   waste incinerators reduce the amount of some atmospheric pollutants by substituting power produced by coal-fired plants with power from waste-fired plants 
gaseous emissions  
dioxin and furans  
the most publicized concerns from environmentalists about the incineration of municipal solid wastes  msw  involve the fear that it produces significant amounts of
and
emissions  dioxins and furans are considered by many to be serious health hazards  the epa announced in 2012 that the safe limit for human oral consumption is 0.7 picograms toxic equivalence  teq  per kilogram bodyweight per day  which works out to 17 billionths of a gram for a 150lb person per year 
in 2005  the ministry of the environment of germany  where there were 66 incinerators at that time  estimated that     whereas in 1990 one third of all dioxin emissions in germany came from incineration plants  for the year 2000 the figure was less than 1  
and tiled stoves in private households alone discharge approximately 20 times more dioxin into the environment than incineration plants  
according to the   the combustion percentages of the total dioxin and furan inventory from all known and estimated sources in the u s   not only incineration  for each type of incineration are as follows  35.1  backyard barrels  26.6  medical waste  6.3  municipal   5.9  municipal waste combustion  2.9  industrial wood combustion  thus  the controlled combustion of waste accounted for 41.7  of the total dioxin inventory 
in 1987  before the governmental regulations required the use of emission controls  there was a total of 8,905.1 grams  314.12oz  toxic equivalence  teq  of dioxin emissions from us municipal waste combustors  today  the total emissions from the plants are 83.8 grams  2.96oz  teq annually  a reduction of 99  
backyard barrel burning of household and   still allowed in some rural areas  generates 580 grams  20oz  of dioxins annually  studies conducted by the us-epa demonstrated that the emissions from just one family using a burn barrel produced more emissions than an incineration plant disposing of 200 metric tons  220 short tons  of waste per day by 1997 and five times that by 2007 due to increased chemicals in household trash and decreased emissions by municipal incinerators using better technology 
however  the same researchers found that their original estimates for the burn barrel were high  and that the incineration plant used for comparison represented a theoretical  clean  plant rather than any existing facility  their later studies found that burn barrels produced a median of 24.95 nanograms teq per lb garbage burned  so that a family burning 5lbs of trash per day  or 1825lbs per year  produces a total of 0.0455mg teq per year  and that the equivalent number of burn barrels for the 83.8 grams  2.96oz  of the 251 municipal waste combustors inventoried by the epa in the u s  in 2000  is 1,841,700  or on average  7337 family burn barrels per municipal waste incinerator 
most of the improvement in u s  dioxin emissions has been for large-scale municipal waste incinerators  as of the year 2000  although small-scale incinerators  those with a daily capacity of less than 250 tons  processed only 9  of the total waste combusted  these produced 83  of the dioxins and furans emitted by municipal waste combustion 
dioxin cracking methods and limitations

the breakdown of dioxin requires exposure of the molecular ring to a sufficiently high temperature so as to trigger thermal breakdown of the strong molecular bonds holding it together  small pieces of fly ash may be somewhat thick  and too brief an exposure to high temperature may only degrade dioxin on the surface of the ash  for a large volume air chamber  too brief an exposure may also result in only some of the exhaust gases reaching the full breakdown temperature  for this reason there is also a time element to the temperature exposure to ensure heating completely through the thickness of the fly ash and the volume of waste gases 
there are trade-offs between increasing either the temperature or exposure time  generally where the molecular breakdown temperature is higher  the exposure time for heating can be shorter  but excessively high temperatures can also cause wear and damage to other parts of the incineration equipment  likewise the breakdown temperature can be lowered to some degree but then the exhaust gases would require a greater lingering period of perhaps several minutes  which would require large long treatment chambers that take up a great deal of treatment plant space 
a side effect of breaking the strong molecular bonds of dioxin is the potential for breaking the bonds of nitrogen gas    and oxygen gas    in the supply air  as the exhaust flow cools  these highly reactive detached atoms spontaneously reform bonds into reactive oxides such as
in the flue gas  which can result in smog formation and
if they were released directly into the local environment  these reactive oxides must be further neutralized with
 scr  or

the temperatures needed to break down dioxin are typically not reached when burning plastics outdoors in a burn barrel or garbage pit  causing high dioxin emissions as mentioned above  while plastic does usually burn in an open-air fire  the dioxins remain after combustion and either float off into the atmosphere  or may remain in the ash where it can be leached down into groundwater when rain falls on the ash pile  fortunately  dioxin and furan compounds bond very strongly to solid surfaces and are not dissolved by water  so leaching processes are limited to the first few milimeters below the ash pile  the gas-phase dioxins can be substantially destroyed using catalysts  some of which can be present as part of the fabric filter bag structure 
modern municipal incinerator designs include a high-temperature zone  where the flue gas is sustained at a temperature above 850c  1,560f  for at least 2 seconds before it is cooled down  they are equipped with auxiliary heaters to ensure this at all times  these are often fueled by oil or natural gas  and are normally only active for a very small fraction of the time  further  most modern incinerators utilize fabric filters  often with teflon membranes to enhance collection of sub-micron particles  which can capture dioxins present in or on solid particles 
for very small municipal incinerators  the required temperature for thermal breakdown of dioxin may be reached using a high-temperature electrical heating element  plus a
stage 
although dioxins and furans may be destroyed by combustion  their reformation by a process known as  de novo synthesis  as the emission gases cool is a probable source of the dioxins measured in emission stack tests from plants that have high combustion temperatures held at long residence times 
co2  
as for other complete combustion processes  nearly all of the carbon content in the waste is emitted as co2 to the atmosphere 
contains approximately the same mass fraction of carbon as co2 itself  27    so incineration of 1 ton of msw produces approximately 1 ton of co2 
if the waste was   1 ton of msw would produce approximately 62 cubic metres  2,200cuft 
via the
decomposition of the
part of the waste  since the
of methane is 34 and the weight of 62 cubic meters of methane at 25 degrees celsius is 40.7kg  this is equivalent to 1.38 ton of co2  which is more than the 1 ton of co2 which would have been produced by incineration  in some countries  large amounts of
are collected  still the global warming potential of the landfill gas emitted to atmosphere is significant  in the us it was estimated that the global warming potential of the emitted landfill gas in 1999 was approximately 32  higher than the amount of co2 that would have been emitted by incineration  since this study  the global warming potential estimate for methane has been increased from 21 to 35  which alone would increase this estimate to almost the triple gwp effect compared to incineration of the same waste 
in addition  nearly all biodegradable waste has biological origin  this material has been formed by plants using atmospheric co2 typically within the last growing season  if these plants are regrown the co2 emitted from their combustion will be taken out from the atmosphere once more   
such considerations are the main reason why several countries administrate incineration of biodegradable waste as   the rest  mainly plastics and other oil and gas derived products  is generally treated as  
different results for the co2 footprint of incineration can be reached with different assumptions  local conditions  such as limited local district heating demand  no fossil fuel generated electricity to replace or high levels of aluminium in the waste stream  can decrease the co2 benefits of incineration  the methodology and other assumptions may also influence the results significantly  for example  the methane emissions from landfills occurring at a later date may be neglected or given less weight  or biodegradable waste may not be considered co2 neutral  a study by eunomia research and consulting in 2008 on potential waste treatment technologies in london demonstrated that by applying several of these  according to the authors  unusual assumptions the average existing incineration plants performed poorly for co2 balance compared to the theoretical potential of other emerging waste treatment technologies 
other emissions  
other gaseous emissions in the flue gas from incinerator furnaces include         and   of the heavy metals 
is a major concern due to its toxicity and high volatility  as essentially all mercury in the municipal waste stream may exit in emissions if not removed by emission controls 
the
content in the flue may produce visible fume from the stack  which can be perceived as a   it may be avoided by decreasing the steam content by
and reheating  or by increasing the flue gas exit temperature well above its dew point  flue-gas condensation allows the latent heat of vaporization of the water to be recovered  subsequently increasing the thermal efficiency of the plant   
flue-gas cleaning  
electrodes inside
the quantity of pollutants in the flue gas from incineration plants may or may not be reduced by several processes  depending on the plant 
particulate is collected by   most often
 esp  and or   the latter are generally very efficient for collecting   in an investigation by the
in 2006  the average particulate emissions per energy content of incinerated waste from 16 danish incinerators were below 2.02g gj  grams per energy content of the incinerated waste   detailed measurements of fine particles with sizes below 2.5    were performed on three of the incinerators  one incinerator equipped with an esp for particle filtration emitted 5.3g gj fine particles  while two incinerators equipped with baghouse filters emitted 0.002 and 0.013g gj pm2.5  for ultra fine particles  pm1.0   the numbers were 4.889g gj pm1.0 from the esp plant  while emissions of 0.000 and 0.008g gj pm1.0 were measured from the plants equipped with baghouse filters 
acid gas
are used to remove         lead and other   the efficiency of removal will depend on the specific equipment  the chemical composition of the waste  the design of the plant  the chemistry of reagents  and the ability of engineers to optimize these conditions  which may conflict for different pollutants  for example  mercury removal by wet scrubbers is considered coincidental and may be less than 50   basic scrubbers remove   forming
by reaction with  
waste water from scrubbers must subsequently pass through a waste water treatment plant   
sulfur dioxide may also be removed by dry
by injection
into the flue gas before the particle filtration   
is either reduced by catalytic reduction with ammonia in a
   scr  or by a high-temperature reaction with ammonia in the furnace    sncr   urea may be substituted for ammonia as the reducing reagent but must be supplied earlier in the process so that it can hydrolyze into ammonia  substitution of urea can reduce costs and potential hazards associated with storage of anhydrous ammonia   
heavy metals are often
on injected
powder  which is collected by particle filtration   
solid outputs  
operation of an incinerator aboard an
incineration produces
and
just as is the case when coal is combusted  the total amount of ash produced by municipal solid waste incineration ranges from 4 to 10  by volume and 1520  by weight of the original quantity of waste  and the fly ash amounts to about 1020  of the total ash    the fly ash  by far  constitutes more of a potential health hazard than does the bottom ash because the fly ash often contain high concentrations of heavy metals such as lead    copper and
as well as small amounts of dioxins and furans  the bottom ash seldom contain significant levels of heavy metals  in testing over the past decade  no ash from an incineration plant in the usa has ever been determined to be a     at present although some historic samples tested by the incinerator operators  group would meet the being ecotoxic criteria at present the ea say  we have agreed  to regard incinerator bottom ash as  non-hazardous  until the testing programme is complete   
other pollution issues  
pollution can be a problem with old-style incinerators  but odors and dust are extremely well controlled in newer incineration plants  they receive and store the waste in an enclosed area with a negative pressure with the airflow being routed through the boiler which prevents
from escaping into the atmosphere  however  not all plants are implemented this way  resulting in inconveniences in the locality   
an issue that affects community relationships is the increased road traffic of
to transport municipal waste to the incinerator  due to this reason  most incinerators are located in industrial areas  this problem can be avoided to an extent through the transport of waste by rail from transfer stations   
debate  
use of incinerators for
is controversial  the debate over incinerators typically involves business interests  representing both waste generators and incinerator firms   government regulators  environmental activists and local citizens who must weigh the economic appeal of local industrial activity with their concerns over health and environmental risk 
people and organizations professionally involved in this issue include the
and a great many local and national air quality regulatory agencies worldwide 
arguments for incineration  
kehrichtverbrennungsanlage
 kezo  in hinwil  switzerland
the concerns over the health effects of
and
emissions have been significantly lessened by advances in emission control designs and very stringent new governmental regulations that have resulted in large reductions in the amount of dioxins and furans emissions 
the u k 
concluded in 2009 that  modern  well managed incinerators make only a small contribution to local concentrations of air pollutants  it is possible that such small additions could have an impact on health but such effects  if they exist  are likely to be very small and not detectable  
incineration plants can generate electricity and heat that can substitute power plants powered by other fuels at the regional electric and
grid  and steam supply for industrial customers  incinerators and other waste-to-energy plants generate at least partially biomass-based renewable energy that offsets greenhouse gas pollution from coal-  oil- and gas-fired power plants  the e u  considers energy generated from biogenic waste  waste with biological origin  by incinerators as non-fossil renewable energy under its emissions caps  these greenhouse gas reductions are in addition to those generated by the avoidance of landfill methane 
the bottom ash residue remaining after combustion has been shown to be a non-hazardous solid waste that can be safely put into landfills or recycled as construction aggregate  samples are tested for ecotoxic metals 
in densely populated areas  finding space for additional landfills is becoming increasingly difficult 
the maishima waste treatment center in osaka  designed by friedensreich hundertwasser  uses heat for power generation 
can be efficiently removed from the flue gases with   even though approximately 40  of the incinerated waste in denmark was incinerated at plants with no baghouse filters  estimates based on measurements by the danish environmental research institute showed that incinerators were only responsible for approximately 0.3  of the total domestic emissions of particulate smaller than 2.5    to the atmosphere in 2006 
incineration of municipal solid waste avoids the release of   every ton of msw incinerated  prevents about one ton of carbon dioxide equivalents from being released to the atmosphere 
most municipalities that operate incineration facilities have higher recycling rates than neighboring cities and counties that do not send their waste to incinerators    this is in part due to enhanced recovery of ceramic materials reused in construction  as well as ferrous and in some cases non-ferrous metals that can be recovered from combustion residue  metals recovered from ash would typically be difficult or impossible to recycle through conventional means  as the removal of attached combustible material through incineration provides an alternative to labor- or energy-intensive mechanical separation methods 
volume of combusted waste is reduced by approximately 90   increasing the life of landfills  ash from modern incinerators is vitrified at temperatures of 1,000c  1,830f  to 1,100c  2,010f   reducing the leachability and toxicity of residue  as a result  special landfills are generally no longer required for incinerator ash from municipal waste streams  and existing landfills can see their life dramatically increased by combusting waste  reducing the need for municipalities to site and construct new landfills 
arguments against incineration  
decommissioned
from 1978  it was demolished by february 2009 
the scottish protection agency s  sepa  comprehensive health effects research concluded  inconclusively  on health effects in october 2009  the authors stress  that even though no conclusive evidence of non-occupational health effects from incinerators were found in the existing literature   small but important effects might be virtually impossible to detect   the report highlights epidemiological deficiencies in previous uk health studies and suggests areas for future studies  the u k 
produced a lesser summary in september 2009  many toxiocologists criticise and dispute this report as not being comprehensive epidemiologically  thin on peer review and the effects of fine particle effects on health   
the highly toxic
must be safely disposed of  this usually involves additional waste miles and the need for specialist toxic waste landfill elsewhere  if not done properly  it may cause concerns for local residents 
the health effects of
and
emissions from old incinerators  especially during start up and shut down  or where filter bypass is required continue to be a problem   
incinerators emit varying levels of heavy metals such as       nickel      lead  and   which can be toxic at very minute levels 
incinerator bottom ash  iba  has elevated levels of heavy metals with ecotoxicity concerns if not reused properly  some people have the opinion that iba reuse is still in its infancy and is still not considered to be a mature or desirable product  despite additional engineering treatments  concerns of iba use in
have been expressed by the uk health and safety executive in 2010 following several construction and demolition explosions  in its guidance document  iba is currently banned from use by the uk highway authority in concrete work until these incidents have been investigated 
alternative technologies are available or in development such as  
 mbt ad  
or
 mht  using steam or
 pgp   which is incineration using electrically produced extreme high temperatures  or combinations of these treatments   
erection of incinerators compete with the development and introduction of other emerging technologies  a uk government wrap report  august 2008 found that in the uk median incinerator costs per ton were generally higher than those for mbt treatments by 18 per   and 27 per metric ton for most modern  post 2000  incinerators 
building and operating waste processing plants such as incinerators requires long contract periods to recover initial investment costs  causing a long term lock-in  incinerator lifetimes normally range 2530 years  this was highlighted by peter jones    the mayor of london s waste representative in april 2009 
incinerators produce fine particles in the furnace  even with modern particle filtering of the flue gases  a small part of these is emitted to the atmosphere  pm2.5 is not separately regulated in the european   even though they are repeatedly correlated spatially to infant mortality in the uk  m  ryan s ons data based maps around the efw chp waste incinerators at edmonton  coventry  chineham  kirklees and sheffield   under wid there is no requirement to monitor stack top or downwind incinerator pm2.5 levels    several european doctors associations  including cross discipline experts such as physicians  environmental chemists and toxicologists  in june 2008 representing over 33,000 doctors wrote a keynote statement directly to the european parliament citing widespread concerns on incinerator particle emissions and the absence of specific fine and ultrafine particle size monitoring or in depth industry government epidemiological studies of these minute and invisible incinerator particle size emissions 
local communities are often opposed to the idea of locating waste processing plants such as incinerators in their vicinity  the

prevention   
and
of waste should all be preferred to incineration according to the   supporters of
consider incinerators and other waste treatment technologies as barriers to
and separation beyond particular levels  and that waste resources are sacrificed for energy production 
a 2008 eunomia report found that under some circumstances and assumptions  incineration causes less co2 reduction than other emerging
and
technology combinations for treating residual mixed waste  the authors found that chp incinerator technology without waste recycling ranked 19 out of 24 combinations  where all alternatives to incineration were combined with advanced waste recycling plants   being 228  less efficient than the ranked 1 advanced mbt maturation technology  or 211  less efficient than plasma gasification autoclaving combination ranked 2 
some incinerators are visually undesirable  in many countries they require a visually intrusive chimney stack   
if reusable waste fractions are handled in waste processing plants such as incinerators in developing nations  it would cut out viable work for local economies  it is estimated that there are 1 million people making a livelihood off collecting waste 
the reduced levels of emissions from municipal waste incinerators and waste to energy plants from historical peaks are largely the product of the proficient use of emission control technology  emission controls add to the initial and operational expenses  it should not be assumed that all new plants will employ the best available control technology if not required by law   
trends in incinerator use  
the history of
 msw  incineration is linked intimately to the history of
and other   the merits of incineration are inevitably judged in relation to the alternatives available  since the 1970s  recycling and other prevention measures have changed the context for such judgements  since the 1990s alternative waste treatment technologies have been maturing and becoming viable 
incineration is a key process in the treatment of hazardous wastes and clinical wastes  it is often imperative that medical waste be subjected to the high temperatures of incineration to destroy
and
contamination it contains 
incineration in north america  
the first incinerator in the u s  was built in 1885 on governors island in new york  in 1949  robert c  ross founded one of the first hazardous waste management companies in the u s  he began robert ross industrial disposal because he saw an opportunity to meet the hazardous waste management needs of companies in northern ohio  in 1958  the company built one of the first hazardous waste incinerators in the u s 
the first full-scale  municipally operated incineration facility in the u s  was the arnold o  chantland resource recovery plant  built in 1975 and located in   this plant is still in operation and produces
that is sent to local power plants for fuel  the first commercially successful incineration plant in the u s  was built in
in october 1975 by wheelabrator technologies  and is still in operation today 
there are several environmental or waste management corporations that transport ultimately to an incinerator or cement kiln treatment center  currently  2009   there are three main businesses that incinerate waste  clean harbours  wti-heritage  and ross incineration services  clean harbours has acquired many of the smaller  independently run facilities  accumulating 57 incinerators in the process across the u s  wti-heritage has one incinerator  located in the southeastern corner of
across the ohio river from west virginia   
several old generation incinerators have been closed  of the 186 msw incinerators in 1990  only 89 remained by 2007  and of the 6200 medical waste incinerators in 1988  only 115 remained in 2003  no new incinerators were built between 1996 and 2007    the main reasons for lack of activity have been 
economics  with the increase in the number of large inexpensive regional landfills and  up until recently  the relatively low price of electricity  incinerators were not able to compete for the  fuel   i e   waste in the u s   
tax policies  tax credits for plants producing electricity from waste were rescinded in the u s  between 1990 and 2004   
there has been renewed interest in incineration and other waste-to-energy technologies in the u s  and canada  in the u s   incineration was granted qualification for
in 2004  projects to add capacity to existing plants are underway  and municipalities are once again evaluating the option of building incineration plants rather than continue landfilling municipal wastes  however  many of these projects have faced continued political opposition in spite of renewed arguments for the greenhouse gas benefits of incineration and improved air pollution control and ash recycling 
incineration in europe  
in europe  with the ban on landfilling untreated waste  scores of incinerators have been built in the last decade  with more under construction  recently  a number of municipal governments have begun the process of contracting for the construction and operation of incinerators  in europe  some of the electricity generated from waste is deemed to be from a  renewable energy source  res  and is thus eligible for tax credits if privately operated  also  some incinerators in europe are equipped with waste recovery  allowing the reuse of ferrous and non-ferrous materials found in landfills  a prominent example is the aeb waste fired power plant 
in sweden  about 50  of the generated waste is burned in waste-to-energy facilities  producing electricity and supplying local cities  district heating systems  the importance of waste in sweden s electricity generation scheme is reflected on their 700.000 tons of waste imported per year to supply waste-to-energy facilities 
incineration in the united kingdom  
main article 
the technology employed in the uk waste management industry has been greatly lagging behind that of europe due to the wide availability of landfills  the
set down by the
led to the government of the united kingdom imposing
including the
and   this legislation is designed to reduce the release of greenhouse gases produced by landfills through the use of alternative methods of waste treatment  it is the uk government s position that incineration will play an increasingly large role in the treatment of municipal waste and supply of energy in the uk   
in 2008  plans for potential incinerator locations exists for approximately 100 sites  these have been interactively mapped by uk ngo s 
under a new plan in june 2012  a defra-backed grant scheme  the farming and forestry improvement scheme  was set up to encourage the use of low-capacity incinerators on agricultural sites to improve their bio security 
incineration units for emergency use  
mobile incineration unit for emergency use
emergency incineration systems exist for the urgent and biosecure disposal of animals and their by-products following a mass mortality or disease outbreak  an increase in regulation and enforcement from governments and institutions worldwide has been forced through public pressure and significant economic exposure   
contagious animal disease has cost governments and industry  200 billion over 20 years to 2012 and is responsible for over 65  of infectious disease outbreaks worldwide in the past sixty years  one-third of global meat exports  approx 6 million tonnes  is affected by trade restrictions at any time and as such the focus of governments  public bodies and commercial operators is on cleaner  safer and more robust methods of animal carcass disposal to contain and control disease   
large-scale incineration systems are available from niche suppliers and are often bought by governments as a safety net in case of contagious outbreak  many are mobile and can be quickly deployed to locations requiring biosecure disposal   
small incinerator units  
an example of a low capacity  mobile incinerator
small-scale incinerators exist for special purposes  for example  the small-scale incinerators are aimed for
safe destruction of medical waste in   small incinerators can be quickly deployed to remote areas where an outbreak has occurred to dispose of infected animals quickly and without the risk of cross contamination   
in popular media  
in   fictional so-called  flash incinerators  exist  which essentially vaporize anything organic 
incinerators make an appearance in
in two varieties  a large  traditional combustion device that spews out a significant amount of air pollution  and a more modern device that converts the
to power the city with a bigger capacity to load the garbage  though still producing a lot of pollution   
they also make an appearance in   but without the non-energy-from-waste variant 
in the climax of   the main protagonist  chell  while on a conveyor belt  escapes an incinerator  after the game s main antagonist    forced her into it   
the climax of
features an infamous scene  where the working of a
incinerator  and of a   was shown dramatically from the inside  as the toys face destruction
