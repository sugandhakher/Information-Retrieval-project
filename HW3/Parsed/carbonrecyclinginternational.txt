history  
cri  incorporated in 2006  was founded by fridrik jonsson  art shulenberger  oddur ingolfsson  and kc tran  partners include         and  
cri s first commercial scale plant  the george olah plant  named after   the nobel prize laureate   was completed in 2011 
renewable methanol  
renewable methanol is methanol derived from renewable energy  it can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock  rm is also a viable input for
production  fuel blends range from rm3  3  methanol and 97  other  to rm100  100  methanol with trace additives   high percentage blends can be used with
 ffvs   while low percentage blends can be used in existing cars  cri is interested in increasing the number of flex-fuel cars in iceland and supplying rm85 
usage concerns  
alcohols  including methanol and ethanol  can be
to certain materials in some vehicles  replacement parts may be necessary for higher blends  but most modern cars are capable of using low blends of methanol 
production  
cri s first csp  the go plant
production of renewable methanol is similar to that of conventional methanol  except that carbon dioxide is substituted for
and hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water 
rm has no connection to agriculture  as water  electricity  and carbon dioxide are the primary inputs of its production process  production of rm is less vulnerable to changes in feedstock prices 
plants  
the george olah plant  or the go plant  has a capacity of 5 million liters per year  it is located close to the
and   the plant is expected to use around 10  of the carbon dioxide produced by svartsengi power station 
legislation  
the  s renewable energy
consider rm to be a renewable fuel  making it a candidate for the eu s renewable fuel blending mandates 
impact  
carbon dioxide is a major component of   by removing carbon dioxide from industrial emissions  cri s process could help mitigate environmental impact  renewable methanol burns cleanly as a fuel  but it has trace amounts of impurities 
cri s process can also be used to store energy in the form of methanol  especially in cases where the energy source is inconsistent  for example 
and
are irregularly available  methanol is also a good energy carrier  being less volatile and easier to store than hydrogen 
future projects  
cri plans to implement standardized csps  commercial scale plants   each with a capacity of 50 million liters per year 
cri may build a 100 ml plant in   having signed a memorandum of understanding with power company  
cri has also entered into a memorandum of understanding with altona energy plc  concerning a potential project using hydrogen byproduct as a feedstock
