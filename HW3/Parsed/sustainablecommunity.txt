city government initiatives  
cities are defined as
units that have small divisions of government within them  these divisions of government have the authority to affect environmental and
results  cities are especially important in initiating sustainable communities because they have
that have political power and credibility to take initiatives to access and deploy
in ways reflecting local conditions that allows them the capacity to manage and lead
for the good of the environment 
it is also necessary to implement sustainable communities in countries that are
because cities are where most environmental and
dwell 
when looking at and comparing sustainable cities certain indicators may be used 
does the city have any
programs that are designed to help manage growth and avoid and eliminate  and minimize impacts on  
does the city have
plans that demonstrate goals for the city in a way that create
areas and maintain them 
does the city follow any legal
that allow
and
to create programs that would help the city become  
how involved in the environmental and
are programs within the city 
is the
system of the city set up to encourage
and not private to reduce  
are there pollution remediation programs in the city 
how
are citizens where their voices are equally heard in order to create social justice and a  
the 34 elements inside taking sustainable cities seriously  can also be used to determine whether a city is considered sustainable or not 
city examples  
the city of
uses the
as a framework to develop laws for a healthier and more just city  the precautionary principal gives more power to community members by allowing them to stand up against
in their neighborhoods and leaves the
to corporations instead of community members  companies must prove that their endeavors are harmless to the community instead of the community having to prove they have been harmed by company endeavors  this allows for a sustainable community as
and social justice are created 
the city of
to create a sustainable community through political involvement has dedicated studies to discovering why citizens are or are not politically active  studies from quebec have shown that citizens
is a large part in determining
in politics  when citizens lack the internal belief that one can make change in government and the external belief that the government will make changes according to citizen concerns  political participation dwindles as citizens believe no change will occur  when becoming politically active  a citizen takes into account the history of the city government  the governments actions  and government interactions with other citizens 
after noting the citys sustainability level it is important to note what kinds of communities are targeted and how they are affected through these programs and what kinds of strategies are being used to try to create and transform sustainable communities 
non-profit and ngo sector

social movement initiatives  
the take back your time movement  led by john de graaf  focuses on the concept of working fewer hours and devoting more time to living a healthy lifestyle  the movement suggests that allowing shorter work days and longer vacations would in turn help better distribute work  while also reducing stress and making for healthier living  additionally  people would have more free time to make more rewarding and sustainable choices for themselves 
the voluntary simplicity movement or
movement emphasizes reducing ones material possessions and desires and increasing self-sufficiency through skills such as gardening and   the voluntary simplicity movement suggests that one should focus on cultivating their own best inner being rather than focus on making material gains and wealth  it also promotes activism within the community to create engaged  educated citizens 
the
movement is based on
and
ideas  focusing on reducing consumption and promoting happy  healthy lifestyles in non-consumptive fashions  main aspects of degrowth include more equal distribution of workload and sharing work  consuming less  and setting aside time for personal and cultural growth through the arts and creativity

are gathering momentum  spreading sustainable community ideas around the world  teaching through example and also offering classes and training on sustainable living    and local economics  ecovillages seek to integrate themselves harmlessly into the ecosystem surrounding them  so as to live and interact in a way that is sustainable and supportive of the natural world
challenges and critiques  
sustainable communities  both as individual projects and as a whole  have faced challenges impeding their development and have been met with criticism 
sustainable communities projects have struggled to take hold for 
poor economic conditions and inaccessible housing markets  in the uks sustainable communities plan  the economic downturn of 2008 has led to a general shortage of housing and affordable housing in particular  which run contrary to the plans premises of livable communities 
projects have been critiqued for 
lacking a well-developed
framework  urban and environmental policy planner julian agyeman has written about the  narrow focus  of civic environmentalism that does not take  social justice  into account  and the need for sustainable communities to be democratic and collaborate with the environmental justice movement 
promoting a securitization agenda  british geographer mike raco argues that the uk s sustainable communities plan employs the discourse of sustainability as  a series of potentially repressive and counter-productive policy measures   
accommodating to
economic systems instead of confronting them  while some rationales for sustainable communities conflict with market-driven agendas  economic growth characterizes the means and ends of some initiatives  additionally  sustainable communities reject the notion that development itself is fundamentally socially divisive or environmentally destructive
