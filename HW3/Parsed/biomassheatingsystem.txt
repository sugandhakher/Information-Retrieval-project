benefits of biomass heating  
the use of biomass in heating systems is beneficial because it uses agricultural  forest  urban and industrial residues and waste to produce heat and electricity with less effect on the
than fossil fuels  this type of energy production has a limited long-term effect on the environment because the carbon in biomass is part of the natural   while the carbon in fossil fuels is not  and permanently adds carbon to the environment when burned for fuel     historically  before the use of
in significant quantities  biomass in the form of

drawbacks of biomass heating  
on a large scale  the use of biomass takes agricultural land out of food production  reduces the carbon sequestration capacity of forests  and extracts nutrients from the soil  combustion of biomass creates air pollutants and adds significant quantities of carbon to the atmosphere that may not be returned to the soil for many decades 
using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of  
 nitrogen oxides   vocs     particulates and other pollutants  in some cases at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas 
 a pollutant created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels  biofuels  and biomass  is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming  in 2009 a swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in south asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning  and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning  researchers measured a significant concentration of   which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels 
on combustion  the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as   the amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50  by weight  when from agricultural sources  plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth  when the biomass is from forests  the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer  and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed 
the biomass-is-carbon-neutral proposal put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature  intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas  when a trees carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse  it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades  current studies indicate that  even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage  and  the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest  
biomass heating in our world  
the
and consequent price increases for natural gas and coal have increased the value of biomass for heat generation  forest renderings  agricultural waste  and
production become competitive as the prices of
fossil fuels rise  efforts to develop this potential may have the effect of
and be a cog in the wheel of a decentralized  multi-dimensional renewable energy industry  efforts to promote and advance these methods became common throughout the
through the 2000s  in other areas of the world  inefficient and polluting means to generate heat from biomass coupled with poor forest practices have significantly added to  
buffer tanks  
buffer tanks store the hot water the biomass appliance generates and circulates it around the heating system  sometimes referred to as  thermal stores   they are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly  or the volume of water in the complete hydraulic system is relatively small  using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output  rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as   dust  and   greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit  in addition  service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles  although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30  of nominal output  in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the  ideal  or test fuel  a suitably sized buffer tank should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50  of the nominal output  in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load  the system should include a buffer tank  in any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions  the system must include a suitably sized buffer tank  the
from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber  light weight  fast response boilers require only 10ltr kw  while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40ltr kw 
types of biomass heating systems  
little biomass heating plant in austria  the heat power is about 1000 kw
the use of biomass in heating systems has a use in many different types of buildings  and all have different uses  there are four main types of heating systems that use biomass to heat a boiler  the types are fully automated  semi-automated  pellet-fired  and combined heat and power 
fully automated  
fully automated systems operate exactly how they sound  chipped or ground up waste wood is brought to the site by delivery trucks and dropped into a holding tank  a system of conveyors then transports the wood from the holding tank to the boiler at a certain managed rate  this rate is managed by computer controls and a laser that measures the load of fuel the conveyor is bringing in  the system automatically goes on and off to maintain the pressure and temperature within the boiler  fully automated systems offer a great deal of ease in their operation because they only require the operator of the system to control the computer  and not the transport of wood while offering comprehensive and cost effective solutions to complex industrial challenges 
semi-automated or  surge bin   
semi-automated or  surge bin  systems are very similar to fully automated systems except they require more manpower to keep operational  they have smaller holding tanks  and a much simpler conveyor systems which will require personnel to maintain the systems operation  the reasoning for the changes from the fully automated system is the efficiency of the system  the heat created by the combustor can be used to directly heat the air or it can be used to heat water in a boiler system which acts as the medium by which the heat is delivered  wood fire fueled boilers are most efficient when they are running at their highest capacity  and the heat required most days of the year will not be the peak heat requirement for the year  considering that the system will only need to run at a high capacity a few days of the year  it is made to meet the requirements for the majority of the year to maintain its high efficiency 
pellet-fired  
the third main type of biomass heating systems are pellet-fired systems  pellets are a processed form of wood  which make them more expensive  although they are more expensive  they are much more condensed and uniform  and therefore are more efficient  further  it is relatively easy to automatically feed pellets to boilers  in these systems  the pellets are stored in a grain-type storage silo  and gravity is used to move them to the boiler  the storage requirements are much smaller for pellet-fired systems because of their condensed nature  which also helps cut down costs  these systems are used for a wide variety of facilities  but they are most efficient and cost effective for places where space for storage and conveyor systems is limited  and where the pellets are made fairly close to the facility 
agricultural pellet systems  
sub category of pellet systems are boilers or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate  paper pellets  hay pellets  straw pellets   one of this kind is petrojet pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber  in terms of efficiencies advanced pellet boilers can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics  advanced pellet boilers can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40c  instead of 120c before sent into the flue 
combined heat and power  
combined heat and power systems are very useful systems in which wood waste  such as   is used to generate power  and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system  they have a very high cost because of the high pressure operation  because of this high pressure operation  the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory  and will raise the cost of operation  another drawback is that while they produce electricity they will produce heat  and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year  the addition of a cooling tower is necessary  and will also raise the cost 
there are certain situations where chp is a good option  wood product manufacturers would use a combined heat and power system because they have a large supply of waste wood  and a need for both heat and power  other places where these systems would be optimal are hospitals and prisons  which need energy  and heat for hot water  these systems are sized so that they will produce enough heat to match the average heat load so that no additional heat is needed  and a cooling tower is not needed
