bushmeat  
over the past century or so  the drc has become the center of what has been called the central african    problem  regarded by many as a major environmental and socio-economic crisis   bushmeat  is another word for the meat of wild animals  typically obtained through trapping  usually with wire snares  or else with shotguns  poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the drc s numerous military conflicts   
the
crisis emerged mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it  a rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions made many congolese dependent on bushmeat  either as an income source  selling the meat   or for food  unemployment and urbanization throughout central africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of
into prime markets for commercial bushmeat   
this combination has caused widespread endangerment of local fauna  and has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat  this overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans  the hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the congo s rainforests from both corporate logging  and farmers clearing forest landfor agriculture  logging allows hunters much easier access to previously-unreachable jungle terrain  while simultaneously eroding away the

immigration to the drc has decreased steadily over the past two decades  most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced  according to the   the number of immigrants in the drc has fallen from just over 1 million in 1960  to 754,000 in 1990  to 480,000 in 2005  to an estimated 445,000 in 2010  official figures are unavailable  partly due to the predominance of the

figures for congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source  from 3 to 6 million  this discrepancy is due to a lack of official  reliable data  emigrants from the drc are above all long-term emigrants  the majority of whom live in africa and to a lesser extent in europe  79.7  and 15.3  respectively  according to estimated 2000 data  new destination countries include south africa and various points en route to europe  the drc has produced a considerable number of

when the country was a belgian colony  the belgian colonizers instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools  making it one of the few african nations to have had literacy in local languages during the european colonial period  this trend was reversed after independence  when french became the sole language of education at all levels  since 1975  the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education  with french becoming the sole language of education from the 3rd year onwards  but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use french from the first year of school onward
