the two principal properties of the electric power supply 
and   differ between regions  a voltage of  nominally  230v and a frequency of 50hz is used in europe  most of africa  most of asia  most of south america and australia  in north america  the most common combination is 120v and a frequency of 60hz  other voltages exist  and some countries may have  for example  230v but 60hz  this is a concern to travelers  since portable appliances designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate or may be destroyed by another  the use of different and incompatible
in different regions and countries  e g   in north america vs  europe  provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements

terminology  
in the us  mains electric power is referred to by several names including  household power    household electricity    house current    powerline    domestic power    wall power    line power    ac power    city power    street power   and    
in the uk  mains electric power is generally referred to as  the mains  
power systems  
for a list of voltages  frequencies  and wall plugs by country  see
worldwide  many different
are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting  the different systems are primarily characterized by their
 receptacles or outlets 
 grounding 
protection against
damage  e g   due to short circuit     and fire hazards
parameter tolerances 
all these parameters vary among regions  the voltages are generally in the range 100240
 always expressed as
voltage   the two commonly used frequencies are 50 and 60hz 
or
power is most commonly used today  although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century  foreign enclaves  such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases  may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas  some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside  e g  in    regions in an effective state of
may have no central electrical authority  with electric power provided by incompatible private sources 
many other combinations of voltage and
were formerly used  with frequencies between 25hz and 133hz and voltages from 100v to 250v 
 dc  has been almost completely displaced by
 ac  in public power systems  but dc was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century  the modern combinations of 230v 50hz and 120v 60hz  listed in   did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal  industrial plants with
will have different  higher voltages installed for large equipment  and different sockets and plugs   but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment

electronic appliances  such as those included within the televisions  computer and related equipment categories above  representing 9  of the total   typically use an ac to dc converter to power the device  this is often capable of operation over the approximate range of 100v to 250v and at 50hz to 60hz  the other categories are typically ac applications and usually have much more restricted input ranges  a study by the
in the uk states that  the existing 230v system is well suited to the future of electricity whether through design or darwinian processes  any current perceived weakness is generally a result of cost reduction and market forces rather than any fundamental technical difficulties  questions as to whether there are alternatives to the existing 230v ac system are often overshadowed by legacy issues  the future smart agenda and cost in all but specific situations  where opportunities do exist they are often for specific parts of the overall load and often small parts in terms of total demand  
building wiring  
see also 
in many countries  household power is   with two or three wired contacts at each outlet  neutral and line wires carry current and are defined as live parts 
the line wire  also known as phase  hot or active contact  and commonly  but technically incorrectly  as live   carries
between the
and the household 
the
completes the electrical circuitremaining at a voltage in proximity to 0vby also carrying
between the
and the household  the neutral is connected to the ground  earth   and therefore has nearly the same
as the earth  this prevents the power circuits from increasing beyond earth voltage  such as when they are struck by lightning or become otherwise charged 
the
or ground connects the chassis of equipment to earth ground as a protection against faults     such as if the insulation on a  hot  wire becomes damaged and the bare wire comes into contact with the metal chassis or case of the equipment

are used to ensure that the ground and neutral wires have the correct voltages  to prevent shocks when touching grounded objects  in some installations  there may be two line conductors which carry
in a   small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables  these exist with either two or three insulated conductors  terminated in a   which is then inserted into a fixed receptacle  socket   larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building  for example  in north american homes a window-mounted self-contained
unit would be connected to a wall plug  whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired  larger

and
are used to detect
between the line and neutral wires  or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle  overload protection  to prevent overheating and fire  these protective devices are usually mounted in a central panelmost commonly a distribution board or consumer unitin a building  but some wiring systems also provide an over current protection device at the socket or within the plug    also known as ground-fault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters  are used to detect ground faults - leakage of current to somewhere other than the neutral and line wires  like the ground wire or a person   when a ground fault is detected  the device quickly cuts off the circuit  in northern and central europe  residential electrical supply is commonly 400v three-phase electric power  which gives 230v between any phase and neutral  house wiring may be a mix of three-phase and single-phase circuits  but three-phase residential use is rare in the uk  high-power appliances such as   water heaters and maybe household power heavy tools like
may be supplied from the 400v three-phase power supply 
voltage levels  
most of   africa  asia   
and most of
use a supply that is within 6  of 230v  in the
and australia the nominal supply voltage is 230v  10  6  to accommodate the fact that most supplies are in fact still 240v         
and some parts of northern south america use a voltage between 100v and 127v  the 230v standard has become widespread so that 230v equipment can be used in most parts of the world with the aid of an
or a change to the equipment s connection plug for the specific country 
measuring voltage  
a distinction should be made between the voltage at the point of supply  nominal system voltage  and the voltage rating of the equipment  utilization voltage   typically the utilization voltage is 3  to 5  lower than the nominal system voltage  for example  a nominal 208v supply system will be connected to motors with  200v  on their nameplates  this allows for the
between equipment and supply  voltages in this article are the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages  power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature  voltages are expressed as
 rms  voltage  voltage tolerances are for steady-state operation  momentary heavy loads  or switching operations in the power distribution network  may cause short-term deviations out of the tolerance band  in general  power supplies derived from large networks with many sources are more stable than those supplied to an isolated community with perhaps only a single generator 
choice of voltage  
main article 
the choice of supply voltage is due more to historical reasons than optimization of the distribution systemonce a voltage is in use and equipment using this voltage is widespread  changing voltage is a drastic and expensive measure  a 230v distribution system will use less conductor material than a 120v system to deliver a given amount of power because the current  and consequently the resistive loss  is lower  while large heating appliances can use smaller conductors at 230v for the same output rating  few household appliances use anything like the full capacity of the outlet to which they are connected  minimum wire size for hand-held or portable equipment is usually restricted by the mechanical strength of the conductors  electrical appliances are used extensively in homes in both 230v and 120v system countries  national electrical codes prescribe
intended to minimize the risk of electric shock and fire 
many areas  such as the usa  which use  nominally  120v make use of
240v systems to supply large appliances  in this system a 240v supply has a centre-tapped neutral to give two 120v supplies which can also supply 240v to loads connected between the two line wires 
systems can be connected to give various combinations of voltage  suitable for use by different classes of equipment  where both single-phase and three-phase loads are served by an electrical system  the system may be labelled with both voltages such as 120/208 or 230/400v  to show the line-to-neutral voltage and the line-to-line voltage  large loads are connected for the higher voltage  other three-phase voltages  up to 830 volts  are occasionally used for special-purpose systems such as oil well pumps  large industrial motors  say  more than 250hp or 150kw  may operate on medium voltage  on 60hz systems a standard for medium voltage equipment is 2400/4160v whereas 3300v is the common standard for 50hz systems 
standardisation  
following voltage harmonisation  electricity supplies within the
are now nominally 230v 10  at 50   for a transition period  19952008   countries that had previously used 220v changed to a narrower asymmetric tolerance range of 230v  6  10  and those  like the uk  that had previously used 240v changed to 230v  10  6   no change in voltage is required by either system as both 220v and 240v fall within the lower 230v tolerance bands  230v 10    some areas of the uk still have 250volts for legacy reasons  but these also fall within the 10  tolerance band of 230volts  in practice  this allows countries to continue to supply the same voltage  220 or 240v   at least until existing supply transformers are replaced  equipment  with the exception of filament bulbs  used in these countries is designed to accept any voltage within the specified range  in the united states and canada  national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120v and allow a range of 114v to 126v     5  to  5    historically 110v  115v and 117v have been used at different times and places in north america  mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110v  however  120v is the nominal voltage 
in 2000 
converted to 230v as the nominal standard with a tolerance of  10  6    this superseding the old 240v standard  as2926-1987  as in the uk  240v is within the allowable limits and  240 volt  is a synonym for mains in
and   in   the electrical power supply to households is at 100v  eastern and northern parts of
 including   and
have a frequency of 50hz  whereas western honsh  including nagoya  osaka  and hiroshima    
and
operate at 60hz  the boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back
 hvdc  substations which interconnect the power between the two grid systems  these are       and the   to accommodate the difference  frequency-sensitive appliances marketed in japan can often be switched between the two frequencies 
history of voltage and frequency

a 50hz 5hz vibrating-reed mains frequency meter for 220v
the first electric utilities built by
in the early 1880s ran on
 dc  at 110v  considered to be a  safe  voltage for consumers 
systems that started appearing mid decade used a high transmission voltage but stepped that down via
to the same 110 volt distribution voltage that edison used  in 1883 edison patented a
distribution system to allow dc generation plants to serve a wider radius of customers  this saved on copper costs since lamps were connected in series on a 220 volt system  with a neutral conductor connected between to carry any imbalance between the two sub-circuits  this was later adapted to ac circuits  most lighting and small appliances ran on 120v  while big appliances could be connected to 240v  this system saved copper and was backward-compatible with existing appliances  also  the original plugs could be used with the revised system 
later metal filament lamps became feasible  in 1899  the berliner elektrizitts-werke  bew   a
electrical utility  decided to greatly increase its distribution capacity by switching to 220 volt nominal distribution  taking advantage of the higher voltage capability of metal filament lamps  the company was able to offset the cost of converting the customer s equipment by the resulting saving in distribution conductors cost  this became the model for electrical distribution in germany and the rest of europe and the 220-volt system became common  north american practice remained with voltages near 110 volts for lamps  in the us at the end of the 19th century  westinghouse decided on 60hz and aeg in germany decided on 50hz eventually leading to the world being mostly divided into two frequency camps  most 60hz systems are nominally 120v and most 50hz nominally 230v  the significant exception is brazil  which has a synchronized 60 hz grid  with both 127v and 220v as standard voltages in different regions  and   50hz for east japan and 60hz for west japan 
voltage regulation  
to maintain the voltage at the customer s service within the acceptable range  electrical distribution utilities use regulating equipment at
or along the distribution line  at a substation  the step-down
will have an automatic on-load tap changer  allowing the ratio between transmission voltage and distribution voltage to be adjusted in steps  for long  several kilometres  rural distribution circuits  automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line  these are   again  with on-load tapchangers to adjust the ratio depending on the observed voltage changes  at each customer s service  the step-down transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment  usually 5  of the nominal voltage  since these taps are not automatically controlled  they are used only to adjust the long-term average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer 
power quality  
main article 
the stability of the voltage and frequency supplied to customers varies among countries and regions   power quality  is a term describing the degree of deviation from the nominal supply voltage and frequency  short-term surges and drop-outs affect sensitive electronic equipment such as computers and   longer-term power outages 
and
and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers  who may have to invest in
or stand-by
sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable  erratic power supply may be a severe economic handicap to businesses and public services which rely on electrical machinery  illumination  climate control and computers  even the best quality power system may have breakdowns or require servicing  as such  companies  governments and other organizations sometimes have backup generators at sensitive facilities  to ensure that power will be available even in the event of a power outage or black out
