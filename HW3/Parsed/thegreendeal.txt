the green deal was a uk government policy  it was given a  soft  launch by the
on 1 october 2012 to permit loans for energy saving measures for properties in great britain and was officially launched in january 2013  these measures were designed to enable consumers to benefit from energy efficient improvements to their home  the loans are repaid through energy bills and transfer with the property rather than those who took out the loan  this means new tenants or owners become liable for a debt they did not enter into  a novel concept in english law  homeowners  or businesses  will be liable to repay the green deal charge  even if the promised saving on their energy bills does not materialize  the intention is that savings on energy bills will outweigh the cost of repayments  this is referred to by decc as the   however  the so-called  golden rule  isnt so much a rule as an aspiration  there are 45 different improvements covered by the green deal and government estimates say that a typical three bedroom semi-detached house could save 270 a year from solid wall insulation  the loans became available on 28 january 2013 
although green deal assessments could be conducted from 1 october 2012  none were done in the first month and only five had been completed nationwide by 28 january 2013  the scheme requires an assessment of 150 or more to determine what if any work can be done  the cost of this is likely to deter many people  the government believes green deal loans will be repaid at a rate no more than 6.92  - this is significantly higher than average household loans  on a loan of 5,000  the overall rate that is repayable is just under 8  over 10 years  or 7.7  over 25 years  further to these charges there will be an initial set up charge followed by a 20 annual fee  failure to repay a green deal will lead to disconnection of gas and electricity supplies  recent surveys have found little awareness among the general public for the green deal  the high interest rates and charges of the scheme have been heavily criticized 
in its first six months 38,259 green deal assessments had taken place  however  only four green deals had been taken out 
lack of demand for the green deal with cuts to the eco programme have left the energy efficiency industry struggling  the lack of demand has led one company  domestic   general insulation  to completely withdraw from the market and will likely lay off 600 staff 
in 2014 a second green deal was launched  as grants rather than the loans which had underpinned the original scheme
in july 2015 following the election of conservative government the energy secretary
announced the green deal would be scrapped as it had failed to deliver its objectives  there was no opposition to the scheme being scrapped but there was concern that there was no replacement scheme  in total 15,000 green deals had been issued  former climate change minister
stated he was confident that the private sector would pick up the slack from the withdrawal of government funding

how it works  
the registers of green deal installers  green deal assessors  green deal advisers and green deal providers became active at the launch  property assessments can now be undertaken by green deal assessor organisations  gdao  and installations under the energy company obligation can now take place by certified installers  following this  the first green deal plans were available from 28 january 2013  although the
 decc  stated that the first green deal plans would not be confirmed until january 2013  green deal assessments performed by green deal advisors took place from 1 october 2012  decc proposes tying low interest loans of estimated 7   issued by green deal providers for
improvements to the energy bills of the properties the upgrades are performed on  these debts would then be passed onto new occupiers when they take over the payment of the bills  however  recent reports show a high number of uk energy customers are in considerable debt 
a green deal advisor has to be employed to perform an inspection of the property to provide a report on advised energy improvement measures  a green deal advice report is only valid when produced by a green deal advisor that complies with  nos  standards  the funding for these measures is then issued by the green deal finance company     following this the green deal provider and a green deal installer will install the measures  it is hoped the green deal will lead to the renovation of the uk s housing stock with an estimated 14 million homes seeing energy efficiency improvements ranging from   
and loft insulation through to gas and oil boilers  and renewable technologies such as solar pv  solar thermal and heat pumps 
the green deal was included in the
and came into force on 1 october 2012  decc announced a list of pioneer green deal providers in april 2012  twenty two providers  including three of the biggest six energy companies and    the only high street name  have signed a declaration stating they intend to become green deal providers  once decc had appointed the green deal oversight body  other expected providers such as  
and the other three major energy companies were missing from the list  fears of low take up of the green deal has led government to budget 200 million to encourage early uptake  the policy caused a rift in the coalition government in april 2012  senior conservative ministers  including
  communities and local government secretary   called for the scheme to be scrapped as it could cost the so-called  squeezed  middle  thousands of pounds  the green deal will rely on the
to provide safeguards for those taking out green deal loans 
gemserv has been contracted as the scheme administrators for the green deal oversight and registration body  gd orb   alongside its role of operating the microgeneration certification scheme mcs  and the biomass suppliers list  bsl   the gd orb manages scheme administrative functions  such as maintaining the public registers of authorised participants and participant helpdesk  as well as working alongside industry and government to further develop and share best practice in operational processes  and raising awareness about consumer protection issues 
following the renewable heat incentive announcement and three consultations which were published by decc in september 2012  it is proposed that the
will be linked to the green deal if a property does not meet the minimum energy efficiency requirements to have a renewable heat technology installed i e  a property could then look to use the green deal to achieve this standard 
fabric first  insulation issues are commonly the first measures that need to be improved for a household to be more energy-efficient  a green deal assessor will note internal insulation  external insulation  windows  doors and draught excluders  once these have been updated  other things such as boilers  solar power panels  rainwater harvesters and other green technologies  can all be studied and implemented 
on 1 may  the government announced the new green deal home improvement fund  gdhif   a new energy efficiency incentive available to households in england and wales for taking measures to improve the energy efficiency in their homes  the households will be eligible to claim up to 7,600 for improving their homes  the incentive went live on 9 june 2014 
the green deal home improvement fund  gdhif   
the green deal home improvement fund  gdhif  is a new incentive scheme open to all householders in england and wales wanting to improve the energy efficiency of their homes 
the scheme allows householders to choose one or both of the two core offers available and may also be eligible to claim up to 7,600 as a bundled package  the policy closed to new applications on 24 july 2014
core offer 1
up to 1,000 for installing two energy saving improvements from the list of 12 eligible measures below 
1   condensing mains gas boiler
2   fan assisted storage heaters
3   flue gas heat recovery
4   replacement warm-air unit
5   waste water heat recovery
6   cavity wall insulation
7   flat roof insulation
8   floor insulation
9   room in a roof insulation
10  double triple glazing  replacing single glazing 
11  secondary glazing
12  energy efficient replacement doors
core offer 2
up to 75  of the total cost of the installation of internal or external solid wall insulation  up to a maximum value of 6,000  making this high carbon saving improvement much more affordable 
core offer 3
householders can also claim a refund of up to 100 for a green deal assessment report  gdar  that is less than 24 months old when they do work in this scheme 
core offer 4
an additional bonus of up to 500 for homebuyers who have bought a home in the last 12 months prior to application 
requirements
to be eligible for the gdhif scheme offers householders must satisfy the following incentive criteria 
 customers must apply for the voucher before the work starts
 measures must be recommended in an energy performance certificate  epc  or gdar carried out in the last 24 months
 the gdhif can work with green deal finance which could be used to help to pay for some of the costs of installation
 customers will not be eligible for the gdhif incentive if they receive eco or other central government funding  on the energy saving improvements applied for under gdhif
this scheme closed on 24 july  due to overwhelming demand  in october 2014 however  the government announced an additional 100m of funding would be made available for the gdhif phase 2 although further details are yet to be revealed

criticism  
the green deal has been criticized by a broad range of groups such as  
and the   these criticisms have ranged from a fear that it will increase
to concerns over the viability of the bundled loans as
following the similar financial products that were created from us housing which led to the   the building industry has raised concern about the lack of stimulus to drive demand for the uptake of the green deal  other worries include its limited projected coverage to consumer protection  its treatment of non-domestic buildings and lack of competition among suppliers  government has confirmed the green deal for business has been put on hold for the foreseeable future 
there has also been doubts cast over whether the central tenet of the scheme - the so-called    whereby the cost of repayments never outweighs the savings on the bill - will actually be successfully implemented  there is also criticism that it will only benefit the middle class and not be of any help to those most in need and the working class  the green deal has also been criticized by the
for its lack of protection for consumers  particularly those inheriting a green deal when taking over a property the policy has also been criticized by senior conservative mps  when it was revealed that for any work on a property to get planning permission it would also be forced to take on a green deal  this has been dubbed a  conservatory tax  by the media 
has also raised concerns about the lack of consumer redress  particularly for those who inherit a green deal  this secondary mis-selling would mean that unless the green deal provider issued a transferable warranty for the works under current contract law  the new occupiers who had not agreed the original contract would be unable to get compensation or repairs if the green deal installation was later found to be faulty  for example causes damp 
while the green deal is primarily concerned with buildings  energy efficiency  it is often associated with reducing carbon emissions  and mitigating climate change  however  the effects of   and cash savings being spent on other products and services with associated carbon footprint  means that the green deal may not reduce carbon emissions  unless there is a corresponding supply-side constraint  keeping coal  oil and gas underground 
the choice of gemserv as the certification body has also provoked criticism as it is owned by the 6 largest energy companies in the uk and so will act as a barrier to small businesses being certified and thus benefiting from the green deal  this would undermine decc objective of promoting green growth with the scheme 
the quality of the assessments have been called into doubt  a 2-day course is all that is required to become an assessor  with many assessors relying on a software package to make recommendations rather than any expert knowledge 
mp  the shadow climate change minister  warned   because of sky-high interest rates  hidden charges and penalty payments  the reality for most people will be that the green deal ends up costing them more than they save  
has defended the green deal  stating that despite the lack of interest from the general public and a slow take-up  the policy was never intended to start with a big bang  but rather to build slowly  nevertheless  the government has invested heavily in generating early uptake by consumers 
there have also been issues with conmen posing as green deal assessors  trading standards officers have reported that cold callers are posing as green deal assessors while charging  administration fees 
fuel poverty  
the scheme has faced heavy criticism that it will do nothing to combat the rising levels of fuel poverty in the uk  as with the closure of the
scheme the uk no longer has any policies specifically targeted at lowering fuel poverty 
the government s impact assessment estimates that the green deal will lead to 125,000 to 250,000 households being lifted out of fuel poverty by 2023  but that s nowhere near enough  according to michelle mitchell  charity director general at age uk   the government s target of lifting just 250,000 households out of fuel poverty over the next 10 years is tantamount to trying to bail out a sinking boat with a teacup  in the last month alone another 300,000 households have joined the ranks of the fuel poor   she pointed out 
interest rate  
the high interest rate of the green deal has been extensively criticized since it was revealed at the scheme s launch  interest rates of more than 7  are significantly higher than available high street loans  this has led to some green deal providers such as
raising concerns about the high rates  adding that  unless they were reduced  the scheme would fail  the high interest rate has raised concerns that the green deal will not meet its golden rule 
in order to attract investors  the green deal may need to be altered  compromising its original objective  the range of investors it had been assumed would underpin the green deal would require returns of 11 -15   thus there is a 4-8 percentage point shortfall between what is needed to make the green deal attractive to investors and what the government has set as the loan interest rate 
analysis by engineering consultants  buro happold  concluded that most of the benefits from lower bills as a result of green deal installations would go to investors rather than occupants  based on their gaming workshops  they estimate that consumers will see just 8  of any bill savings  with the remaining 92  going to investors  for a 20,000 investment that saved 500 a year  just 40 a year would accrue to occupants  the main benefit to occupants would be free refurbishment and increased comfort rather than financial savings 
mortgageability questions  
it is not yet entirely clear what kind of legal entity is applied by
documentation to properties that have received green deal loans  or how the mortgage providers will treat those properties when the property is resold or remortgaged  the council of mortgage lenders have issued guidelines  but have stated  lenders will make their own individual commercial decisions in response to the green deal  and these may vary   furthermore  within the background documentation the final paragraph raises questions around the core functionality of the deal   it is not altogether clear why consumers will be attracted by green deal finance at not especially low interest rates  in addition  since the golden rule is to be met only on average  in some cases energy bill savings might not cover the cost of the green deal measures and plan  there are therefore considerable concerns about take up of the green deal   the cml has also expressed concern over a lender s liability for green deal finance in the case of mortgage default 
one potential outcome appears to be not achieving the stated energy cost savings  paying more than necessary for the changes via a limited pool of providers  financed by an uncompetitive loan  that subsequently renders the property difficult or impossible to sell or remortgage  buro happold  in a report on the green deal  suggested there should also be more information on its wider implications  such as how it impacts fuel poverty  property value and re-saleability  the researchers also warn that the as yet unknown impact on the resale value of homes from refurbishments and green deal debts attached to the property could deter uptake 
risk of overheating  
research studies by prof chris goodier of loughborough university and prof li shao of the university of reading indicate risks of overheating in dwellings to which green deal improvements have been made  the risk of overheating has been overlooked in the  big rush to insulate and make homes airtight  in order to protect against the cold in winter  this is a particular problem as more extreme weather  including heatwaves  is being predicted for the uk by meteorologists  this would be most likely to affect elderly or otherwise vulnerable residents living in urban areas in  top floor flats in 1960s tower blocks  and modern detached houses     particularly if they were south facing  
energy company obligation  
the department of energy and climate change  decc  wants energy companies to make improvements to some homes at no upfront cost to the consumer 
the scheme is funded by energy suppliers with the aim of increasing energy efficiency and decreasing household energy bills in the uk 
the energy company obligation  eco  is aimed at helping those in vulnerable and hard-to-treat homes  eco will be funded by the big energy suppliers and they look to implement measures worth around 1.3 billion every year  this cost will be passed onto all consumers through their energy bills  where the cost of the work outweighs the savings  or people need that financial help  energy suppliers may be able to top-up finance for the works  the eco takes over from existing obligations such as cert  cesp and the warm front 
there are two main energy efficient measures which the eco will look to implement 
those measures include hard to treat cavity wall insulation  and solid wall insulation  internal or external  
people living in low income areas are eligible for further energy efficiency measures such as loft insulation and gas boilers 
people on certain benefits who live in a private property may qualify for more energy efficiency measures  including boiler repairs or replacements 
in april a pilot scheme was tested by a partnership consisting of the centre for sustainable energy  scottish and southern energy  and sedgemoor  taunton deane and west somerset local authorities  the  somerset west hard to treat  pilot scheme was so successful it led to the creation of a much larger programme aimed at better understanding of the green deal and eco    in a speech about the eco programme deputy prime minister nick clegg said   it is shameful that the uk still has so many families unable to heat their homes   the government has now passed a legal obligation onto the energy companies to meet the full costs of implementing the eco    decc has stated that the emergence of a competitive green deal provider market would be likely to lead to cost efficiencies  lowering the cost of delivering eco 
changes to the energy company obligation are currently being consulted on by decc
