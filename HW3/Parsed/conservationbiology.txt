use of the term  
this term conservation biology was introduced as the title of a conference held at the
in la jolla  california in 1978 organized by biologists bruce wilcox and   the meeting was prompted by the concern among scientists over   disappearing species  eroding
within species  the conference and proceedings that resulted sought to bridge a gap existing at the time between theory in ecology and population biology on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other  conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity    emerged together  helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and   the inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to the development of several new subdisciplines including   conservation social science 
and  
description  
the rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a  discipline with a deadline   conservation biology is tied closely to
in researching the
           and   of
or   conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the maintenance  loss  and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender       and ecosystem diversity  the concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50  of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years  which has contributed to poverty  starvation  and will reset the course of evolution on this planet 
conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of biodiversity loss  species   and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to
the well-being of human society  conservation biologists work in the field and office  in government  universities  non-profit organizations and industry  the topics of their research are diverse  because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences  those dedicated to the cause and profession
for a global response to
based on     and scientific   organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research  monitoring  and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales 
history  
the conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem  unless we solve that problem  it will avail us little to solve all others

natural resource conservation  
conscious efforts to conserve and protect global biodiversity are a recent phenomenon  natural resource conservation  however  has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation  resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature  regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained  therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community  this social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the    
from this principle  conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict  for example  the alaskan
peoples and the
of the
had resource boundaries  rules  and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of   these rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed  there are numerous examples in history where cultures have followed rules  rituals  and organized practice with respect to communal natural resource management 
conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings  there are examples in the      
and
traditions  in greek philosophy  plato lamented about pasture land degradation   what is left now is  so to say  the skeleton of a body wasted by disease  the rich  soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left   in the bible  through moses  god commanded to let the land rest from cultivation every seventh year  before the 18th century  however  much of european culture considered it a
to admire nature  wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised  however  as early as ad 680 a wildlife sanctuary was founded on the

and   by 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in   250 in   250 in the   and 300 in   preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries 
before charles darwin set sail on the hms beagle  most people in the world  including darwin  believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged  george-louis leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief  he proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences  erasmus darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved  erasmus darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species  ancestors  the thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist 
by the early 19th century
was ignited through the efforts of  
and   the 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors  although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and   their writings  by modern standards  showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections 
conservation movement  
main article 
the modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century
period particularly in
and   a number of thinkers  among them notably   described the importance of  preserving nature   much of this early emphasis had its origins in  
scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of   the conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles  that human activity damaged the   that there was a
to maintain the environment for future generations  and that scientific  empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out  sir
was prominent in promoting this ideology  publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation  and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in
through the establishment of  
the
started local conservation efforts in 1842  headed by   a professional
who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles  this was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world 
introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855  a model that soon spread to   as well the united states  where
was opened in 1872 as the worlds first national park 
the term conservation came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management  mainly for economic reasons  of such natural resources as   fish  game      and minerals  in addition it referred to the preservation of forests     wildlife     parkland    and   this period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies  the
was passed in britain as the first nature protection law in the world after extensive lobbying from the association for the protection of seabirds and the respected
  newton was also instrumental in the passage of the first
from 1872  which protected animals during their breeding season so as to prevent the stock from being brought close to extinction 
one of the first conservation societies was the   founded in 1889 in
as a
campaigning against the use of
and
skins and feathers in   originally known as  the plumage league   the group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the fur and feather league in croydon  and formed the rspb  the
formed in 1895 with the manifesto to     promote the permanent preservation  for the benefit of the nation  of lands     to preserve  so far practicable  their natural aspect  
in the   the
gave the president power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain 
founded the
in 1892  and the
was set up in 1895  a series of
were established by
from 1901 to 1909  the 1916 national parks act  included a  use without impairment  clause  sought by john muir  which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in dinosaur national monument in 1959 
and
on
in  
in the 20th century 
civil servants  including
and
spearheaded the movement toward wildlife conservation 
global conservation efforts  
in the mid-20th century  efforts arose to target individual species for conservation  notably efforts in
conservation in
led by the new york zoological society  in the early 20th century the new york zoological society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities  the work of henry fairfield osborn jr    
and
is notable in this era    akeley for example  having led expeditions to the
and observed the
in the wild  became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities  he was instrumental in persuading
to act in defense of the

developed in     the   hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued  notably the united nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind  the programme was adopted by the general conference of
in 1972  as of 2006  a total of 830 sites are listed  644 cultural  162 natural  the first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the united states  which passed back to back legislation in the endangered species act  1966  and
 1970   which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research  other conservation developments  however  have taken hold throughout the world  india  for example  passed the  
in 1980 a significant development was the emergence of the
movement  a local organization was established in     a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the uk  then overseas  although perceived as a   its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife  initially perceived as radical  the movement s view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought  considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology  the
originated in 1985 
by 1992 most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the   subsequently many countries began programmes of
to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders  as well as protect associated habitats  the late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector  with the maturing of organisations such as the
and the  
since 2000 the concept of
has risen to prominence  with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions  instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists  although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species 
ecology has clarified the workings of the   i e   the complex interrelationships among humans  other species  and the physical environment  the
and associated     and the ensuing pollution  have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted 

the last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant   what good is it   if the land mechanism as a whole is good  then every part is good  whether we understand it or not  if the biota  in the course of aeons  has built something we like but do not understand  then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts  to keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering 

 
concepts and foundations  
measuring extinction rates  
marine extinction intensity during the
 
millions of years ago
the blue graph shows the apparent percentage  not the absolute number  of marine
becoming extinct during any given time interval  it does not represent all marine species  just those that are readily fossilized  the labels of the  big five  extinction events are clickable hyperlinks  see
for more details    
extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways  conservation biologists measure and apply
of   rates of   and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy to obtain such estimates 
is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction  the current
is estimated to be one species every few years 
the measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the earth s species have not been described or evaluated  estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist  estimated range  3,600,000-111,700,000  to how many have received a
 estimated range  1.5-8 million   less than 1  of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting its existence  from these figures  the iucn reports that 23  of   5  of
and 70  of plants that have been evaluated are designated as
or   better knowledge is being constructed by
for actual numbers of species 
systematic conservation planning  
systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems  margules and pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach 
compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
identify conservation goals for the planning region
review existing conservation areas
select additional conservation areas
implement conservation actions
maintain the required values of conservation areas
conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for
or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices  e g    systematic strategies generally employ the services of
to assist in the decision making process 
conservation physiology  a mechanistic approach to conservation  
was defined by
and colleagues as  an integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts  tools  and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications  understanding and predicting how organisms  populations  and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors  and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa  i e  including microbes  plants  and animals   physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales  and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations  restore ecosystems  inform conservation policy  generate decision-support tools  and manage natural resources  conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines 
conservation biology as a profession  
the
is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity  conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology  into subjects such as             and   within biology 
and
are immense fields unto themselves  but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology 
is conservation biology an
when biologists
for an inherent   do conservationists introduce
when they support policies using qualitative description  such as   or healthy   as all scientists hold values  so do conservation biologists  conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of       and
in their conservation management plans  this sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options  both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach 
there is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large  the movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an adaptive management approach  the concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power  authority  and dominance  adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring  purposeful  and collegial  adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the aldo leopold leadership program
approaches  
conservation may be classified as either   which is protecting an endangered species in its natural   or   which occurs outside the natural habitat  in-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat  ex-situ conservation  on the other hand  involves protection outside of an organism s natural habitat  such as on reservations or in gene banks  in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat 
also  non-interference may be used  which is termed a
method  preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans  in this regard  conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension  as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems  some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans 
ethics and values  
see also 
and
conservation biologists are
researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences  chan states that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values  a conservationist researches biodiversity and reasons through a resource conservation ethic   which identify what measures will deliver  the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time   13
some conservation biologists argue that nature has an
that is independent of
usefulness or   intrinsic value advocates that a gene  or species  be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain 
was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy  ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists  his writing is often required reading for those in the profession

the international union for the conservation of nature  iucn  has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis  the iucn provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its red list  the iucn red list serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity  more than the dramatic rates of species loss  however  conservation scientists note that the sixth mass extinction is a biodiversity crisis requiring far more action than a priority focus on  
or   concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes  such as migration  and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species  including genetic  population and ecosystem diversity  extensive  systematic  and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity  while the
of species is employed extensively in conservation management  some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity  moreover  common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services 
while most in the community of conservation science  stress the importance  of   there is debate on how to prioritize genes  species  or ecosystems  which are all components of biodiversity  e g  bowen  1999   while the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving   some scientists  e g  and conservation organizations  such as the   argue that it is more cost-effective  logical  and socially relevant to invest in biodiversity coldspots  the costs of discovering  naming  and mapping out the distribution of every species  they argue  is an ill-advised conservation venture  they reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species 
biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes  species  and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the earth s surface  for example         44  of all species of vascular plants and 35  of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4  of the land surface of the earth  
those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity  they point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the earth s ecosystems where   not biodiversity  reigns supreme  it is estimated that 36  of the earth s surface  encompassing 38.9  of the worlds vertebrates  lacks the
to qualify as biodiversity hotspot  moreover  measures show that maximizing protections for biodiversity does not capture ecosystem services any better than targeting randomly chosen regions  population level biodiversity  i e  coldspots  are disappearing at a rate that is ten times that at the species level  the level of importance in addressing biomass versus endemism as a concern for conservation biology is highlighted in literature measuring the level of threat to global ecosystem carbon stocks that do not necessarily reside in areas of endemism  a hotspot priority approach would not invest so heavily in places such as   the   the   or   these areas contribute a great abundance of population  not species  level biodiversity and   including cultural value and planetary  
summary of 2006 iucn red list categories 
those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem  they are concentrated in places that are most threatened  and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections  the
categories  which appear on wikipedia species articles  is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action  species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale      this is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass    species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability  ecosystem processes  evolutionary   and biomass  both sides agree  however  that conserving biodiversity is necessary to reduce the extinction rate and identify an inherent value in nature  the debate hinges on how to prioritize limited conservation resources in the most cost-effective way

the ecological credit crunch is a global challenge  the living planet report 2008 tells us that more than three-quarters of the world s people live in nations that are ecological debtors  their national consumption has outstripped their country s biocapacity  thus  most of us are propping up our current lifestyles  and our economic growth  by drawing  and increasingly overdrawing  upon the ecological capital of other parts of the world

pollination is estimated to provide between 10 and 18 billion dollars of value yearly  the value of ecosystem services on one
island has been imputed to be as great as the
of that region  this planetary wealth is being lost at an incredible rate as the demands of human society is exceeding the bio-regenerative capacity of the earth  while biodiversity and ecosystems are resilient  the danger of losing them is that humans cannot recreate many ecosystem functions through

keystone species  
main article 
some species  called a keystone species form a central supporting hub unique to their the ecosystem  the loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function  as well as the loss of coexisting species  keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem  the importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the
 hydrodamalis gigas  through its interaction with     and  
grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the   sea urchins feed on kelp  while sea otters feed on sea urchins  with the rapid decline of sea otters due to   sea urchin populations
on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed  left unchecked  the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the steller s sea cow s diet and hastened their demise  the sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival  however this was later questioned by turvey and risley  who showed that hunting alone would have driven the steller s sea cow extinct 
indicator species

treatments and management scenarios  or to measure the degree of harm that a
may impart on the health of an ecosystem 
government regulators  consultants  or
regularly monitor indicator species  however  there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective  it is generally recommended that multiple indicators  genes  populations  species  communities  and landscape  be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex  and often unpredictable  response from ecosystem dynamics  noss  1997 8889

 ccd  is not uncommon  however  in 16-month period from 2006 through 2007  29  of 577
across the united states reported ccd losses in up to 76  of their colonies  this sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector  the cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists      and
are all being considered as possible causes 
another highlight that links conservation biology to insects  forests  and climate change is the
 dendroctonus ponderosae 
of   canada  which has infested 470,000km2  180,000sqmi  of forested land since 1999  an action plan has been prepared by the government of british columbia to address this problem 
this impact  pine beetle epidemic  converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak  in the worst year  the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in british columbia were equivalent to 75  of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of canada during 19591999

conservation biology of parasites  
main article 
a large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction  a few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals  however  most of them are harmless  threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations  or the extinction of host species 
threats to biodiversity  
main article 
today  many threats to biodiversity exist  an acronym that can be used to express the top threats of present-day h i p p o stands for habitat loss  invasive species  pollution  human population  and overharvesting  the primary threats to biodiversity are
 such as        and
 such as  
also poses challenges  because the global network of protected areas only covers 11.5  of the earth s surface  a significant consequence of fragmentation and lack of
is the reduction of animal migration on a global scale  considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for
across the earth  the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology 
human activities are associated directly or indirectly with nearly every aspect of the current extinction spasm 
wake and vredenburg
however  human activities need not necessarily cause irreparable harm to the biosphere  with
for biodiversity at all levels  from
to ecosystems  there are examples where humans mutually coexist in a sustainable way with nature  even with the current threats to biodiversity there are ways we can improve the current condition and start anew 
many of the threats to biodiversity  including disease and climate change  are reaching inside borders of protected areas  leaving them  not-so protected   e g       for example  is often cited as a serious threat in this regard  because there is a
between species extinction and the release of
into the   ecosystems store and
large amounts of carbon which regulates global conditions  in present day  there have been major climate shifts with temperature changes making survival of some species difficult  the
add a catastrophic threat toward a mass extinction of global biological diversity  conservationists have claimed that not all the species can be saved  and they have to decide which their efforts should be used to protect  this concept is known as the conservation triage  the extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 37 percent of all species by 2050  or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years  the current extinction rate is 100-100,000 times more rapid today than the last several billion years

organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology  soul  was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist sir otto frankel to advance
as a new field at the time    who suggested the idea for a conference to wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation  wilcox and   who together initiated planning for the conference in june 1977 when lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at world wildlife fund  felt both genetics and ecology should be represented  wilcox suggested use of a new term conservation biology to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation  subsequently  soul and wilcox wrote in the program for the meeting they jointly convened on september 69  1978  titled first international conference on resesarch in conservation biology   the purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology  community ecology  sociobiology  population genetics  and reproductive biology   this inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities
