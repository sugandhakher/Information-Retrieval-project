types
organic oils
organic oils are produced in remarkable diversity by plants  animals  and other organisms through natural
processes 
is the scientific term for the  
and similar chemicals often found in the oils produced by living things  while oil refers to an overall mixture of chemicals  organic oils may also contain chemicals other than lipids  including  
 class of compounds with oil-like properties that are solid at common temperatures  and  
lipids can be classified by the way that they are made by an organism  their chemical structure and their limited
in water compared to oils  they have a high
and
content and are considerably lacking in
compared to other organic compounds and minerals  they tend to be relatively
molecules  but may include both polar and nonpolar regions as in the case of
and steroids 
mineral oils
crude oil  or   and its refined components  collectively termed   are crucial resources in the modern economy  crude oil originates from ancient
  such as
and   which
processes convert into oil  the name  mineral oil  is a   in that minerals are not the source of the oilancient plants and animals are  mineral oil is organic  however  it is classified as  mineral oil  instead of as  organic oil  because its organic origin is remote  and was unknown at the time of its discovery   and because it is obtained in the vicinity of rocks  underground traps  and sands 
also refers to several specific distillates of crude oil 
applications
cooking
main article 
several edible vegetable and animal oils  and also   are used for various purposes in cooking and food preparation  in particular  many foods are fried in oil much hotter than boiling water  oils are also used for flavoring and for modifying the texture of foods  e g    
cooking oils are derived either from animal fat  as  
and other types  or plant oils from the    
and many other species

heat transfer

oils are used as coolants in   for instance in electric   heat transfer oils are used both as
 see    for heating  e g  in   and in other applications of heat transfer 
lubrication
given that they are non-polar  oils do not easily adhere to other substances  this makes them useful as
for various engineering purposes  mineral oils are more commonly used as machine lubricants than biological oils are 
is preferred for lubricating clocks  because it does not evaporate  leaving dust  although its use was banned in 1980 
it is a long-running myth that
from whales has still been used in nasa projects such as the hubble telescope and the voyager probe because of its extremely low freezing temperature  spermaceti is not actually an oil  but a mixture mostly of wax esters  and there is no evidence that nasa has used whale oil 
fuel
synthetic motor oil
some oils
in liquid or
form  generating   and
which can be used directly or converted into other forms of energy such as electricity or mechanical work  to obtain many fuel oils 
is pumped from the ground and is shipped via
or a
to an   there  it is converted from crude oil to
 petrodiesel  
 and other short-chain   
 heaviest of commercial fuels  used in ships furnaces  
 petrol      
 historically   and   a 42-gallon barrel  u s   of crude oil produces approximately 10 gallons of diesel  4 gallons of jet fuel  19 gallons of gasoline  7 gallons of other products  3 gallons split between heavy fuel oil and liquified petroleum gases  and 2 gallons of heating oil  the total production of a barrel of crude into various products results in an increase to 45 gallons  not all oils used as fuels are mineral oils  see
and  
in the 18th and 19th centuries 
was commonly used for lamps  which was replaced with natural gas and then electricity 
chemical feedstock
crude oil can be refined into a wide variety of component  
are the refined
and the chemical products made from them  they are used as             and  
organic oils are another important chemical feedstock  especially in
