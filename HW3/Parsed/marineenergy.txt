marine energy or marine power  also sometimes referred to as ocean energy  ocean power  or marine and hydrokinetic energy  refers to the energy carried by       and   the movement of water in the worlds oceans creates a vast store of   or energy in motion  this energy can be harnessed to
electricity to power homes  transport and industries

forms of ocean energy  
renewable  
the oceans represent a vast and largely untapped source of energy in the form of surface waves  fluid flow    and thermal 
marine and hydrokinetic  mhk  or marine energy development in u s  and international waters includes projects using the following devices 
converters in open coastal areas with significant waves 
placed in coastal and estuarine areas 
in fast-moving rivers 
in areas of strong marine currents 
in deep tropical waters 
marine current power  
main article 
strong ocean currents are generated from a combination of temperature  wind  salinity    and the rotation of the earth  the sun acts as the primary driving force  causing winds and temperature differences  because there are only small fluctuations in current speed and stream location with no changes in direction  ocean currents may be suitable locations for deploying energy extraction devices such as turbines 
ocean currents are instrumental in determining the
in many regions around the world  while little is known about the effects of removing ocean current energy  the impacts of removing current energy on the
may be a significant environmental concern  the typical turbine issues with blade strike  entanglement of marine organisms  and acoustic effects still exists  however  these may be magnified due to the presence of more diverse populations of marine organisms using ocean currents for migration purposes  locations can be further offshore and therefore require longer power cables that could affect the marine environment with electromagnetic output 
osmotic power  
main article 
at the mouth of rivers where fresh water mixes with salt water  energy associated with the salinity gradient can be harnessed using pressure-retarded reverse osmosis process and associated conversion technologies  another system is based on using freshwater upwelling through a turbine immersed in seawater  and one involving electrochemical reactions is also in development 
significant research took place from 1975 to 1985 and gave various results regarding the economy of pro and red plants  it is important to note that small-scale investigations into salinity power production take place in other countries like japan  israel  and the united states  in europe the research is concentrated in norway and the netherlands  in both places small pilots are tested  salinity gradient energy is the energy available from the difference in salt concentration between freshwater with saltwater  this energy source is not easy to understand  as it is not directly occurring in nature in the form of heat  waterfalls  wind  waves  or radiation 
ocean thermal energy  
main article 
water typically varies in temperature from the surface warmed by direct sunlight to greater depths where sunlight cannot penetrate  this differential is greatest in
waters  making this technology most applicable in water locations  a fluid is often vaporized to drive a turbine that may generate electricity or produce
water  systems may be either open-cycle  closed-cycle  or hybrid 
tidal power  
main article 
the energy from moving masses of water  a popular form of
power generation  tidal power generation comprises three main forms  namely      and  
wave power  
main article 
solar energy from the sun creates temperature differentials that result in wind  the interaction between wind and the surface of water creates waves  which are larger when there is a greater distance for them to build up  wave energy potential is greatest between 30 and 60 latitude in both hemispheres on the west coast because of the global direction of wind  when evaluating wave energy as a technology type  it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches        and  
the wave energy sector is reaching a significant milestone in the development of the industry  with positive steps towards commercial viability being taken  the more advanced device developers are now progressing beyond single unit demonstration devices and are proceeding to array development and multi-megawatt projects  the backing of major utility companies is now manifesting itself through partnerships within the development process  unlocking further investment and  in some cases  international co-operation 
at a simplified level  wave energy technology can be located near-shore and offshore  wave energy converters can also be designed for operation in specific water depth conditions  deep water  intermediate water or shallow water  the fundamental device design will be dependent on the location of the device and the intended resource characteristics 
non-renewable  
and
beneath the ocean floor are also sometimes considered a form of ocean energy  an
directs all phases of     and delivering offshore petroleum  via
and    a complex and demanding task  also centrally important is the development of new methods to protect marine wildlife and coastal regions against the
of offshore oil extraction 
marine energy development  
the uk is leading the way in wave and tidal  marine  power generation  the world s first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of the marine energy industry in the uk  based in orkney  scotland  the
has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world  the centre was established with around 36 million of funding from the scottish government  highlands and islands enterprise  the carbon trust  uk government  scottish enterprise  the european union and orkney islands council  and is the only accredited wave and tidal test centre for marine renewable energy in the world  suitable for testing a number of full-scale devices simultaneously in some of the harshest weather conditions while producing electricity to the national grid 
clients that have tested at the centre include aquamarine power  aw energy  pelamis wave power  seatricity  scottishpower renewables and wello on the wave site  and alstom  formerly tidal generation ltd   andritz hydro hammerfest  kawasaki heavy industries  magallanes  nautricity  open hydro  scotrenewables tidal power  and voith on the tidal site 
leading the 11m foresea  funding ocean renewable energy through strategic european action  project  which provides funding support to ocean energy technology developers to access europe s world-leading ocean energy test facilities  emec will welcome a number of wave and tidal clients to their pipeline for testing on site 
beyond device testing  emec also provides a wide range of consultancy and research services  and is working closely with marine scotland to streamline the consenting process for marine energy developers  emec is at the forefront in the development of international standards for marine energy  and is forging alliances with other countries  exporting its knowledge around the world to stimulate the development of a global marine renewables industry 
environmental effects  
common environmental concerns associated with marine energy developments include 
the risk of
and
being struck by tidal turbine blades
the effects of
and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices
the physical presence of marine energy projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals  fish  and
with attraction or avoidance
the potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as
