and the rest of the far east  hydraulically operated  pot wheel  pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals   
the power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as   the method was first used at the
in
from 75 ad onwards  but had been developed in
at such mines as   hushing was also widely used in
in the
and later periods to extract
and
ores  it later evolved into
when used during the

described designs for 50 devices  many of them water powered  in his book  the book of knowledge of ingenious mechanical devices  including clocks  a device to serve wine  and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools  though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water  these include   a cow-powered   and a reciprocating device with hinged valves   
in 1753  french engineer
published architecture hydraulique which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines  by the late nineteenth century  the
was developed by a team led by
and prominent pioneers of renewable energy
and
and could now be coupled with hydraulics  the growing demand for the
would drive development as well 
at the beginning of the industrial revolution in britain  water was the main source of power for new inventions such as  s   although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories  it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations  such as driving the bellows in small

in the 1830s  at the early peak in us -building  hydropower provided the energy to transport
traffic up and down steep hills using   as railroads overtook canals for transportation  canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems  the
is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization  built upon the availability of water power 
technological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed
or   in 1848   while working as head engineer of lowell s locks and canals company  improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90  efficiency    he applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design  his mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed confident design of high efficiency turbines to exactly match a site s specific flow conditions  the
is still in wide use today  in the 1870s  deriving from uses in the california mining industry 
developed the high efficiency   which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous california interior 
hydraulic power-pipe networks  
used pipes to carrying pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users  the power source was normally a head of water  which could also be assisted by a pump  these were extensive in
cities in the united kingdom  a hydraulic power network was also developed in   switzerland  the world-famous
was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network

where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate
directly without moving parts  in these designs  a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high level intake  this is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean  high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped  the height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber  while an outlet  submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake  a separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air  a facility on this principle was built on the
at ragged shutes near
in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines 
hydropower types  
main article 
hydropower is used primarily to generate   broad categories include 
  referring to hydroelectric dams 
  which captures the kinetic energy in rivers or streams  without a large reservoir and sometimes without the use of dams 
projects are 10 megawatts or less and often have no artificial reservoirs 
projects provide a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts to isolated homes  villages  or small industries 
projects utilize water which has already been diverted for use elsewhere  in a municipal water system  for example 
stores water pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low 
a
dammed-hydro facility  hydroelectric dam  is the most common type of hydroelectric power generation 
hongping power station  in hongping town    has a design typical for
stations in the western part of china s
province  water comes from the mountain behind the station  through the black pipe seen in the photo
near   u s   is a major
without a sizeable reservoir 
in northwest vietnam
 the upper reservoir  llyn stwlan  and dam of the
in north wales  the lower power station has four water turbines which generate 360 megawatts  480,000hp  of electricity within 60 seconds of the need arising 
calculating the amount of available power  
a hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available   power is a function of the
and   the head is the energy per unit weight  or unit mass  of water  the static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls  dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water  each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head 
the power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water  the height of fall  and the local acceleration due to gravity  in si units  the power is 
p

h
  displaystyle p  eta  rho   qgh   
where
p is power in watts
 is the dimensionless efficiency of the turbine
 is the density of water in kilograms per cubic metre
q is the flow in cubic metres per second
g is the acceleration due to gravity
h is the height difference between inlet and outlet in metres
to illustrate  power is calculated for a turbine that is 85  efficient  with water at 1000kg cubic metre  62.5 pounds cubic foot  and a flow rate of 80 cubic-meters second  2800 cubic-feet second   gravity of 9.81 metres per second squared and with a net head of 145m  480ft

which gives 97 mw
in english units  the density is given in pounds per cubic foot so acceleration due to gravity is inherent in the unit of weight  a conversion factor is required to change from foot lbs second to kilowatts

which gives 97 mw  130,000    
operators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency  procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as
ptc 18 and
60041  field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer s guaranteed efficiency  detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine will account for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock  rise in tail water level due to flow  the location of the station and effect of varying gravity  the temperature and barometric pressure of the air  the density of the water at ambient temperature  and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay  for precise calculations  errors due to rounding and the number of
of constants must be considered   
some hydropower systems such as
can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height  in this case  the available power is the
of the flowing water  over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy   
the water flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season  development of a hydropower site requires analysis of   sometimes spanning decades  to assess the reliable annual energy supply  dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow  however reservoirs have significant   as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow  the design of dams must also account for the worst-case   probable maximum flood  that can be expected at the site  a
is often included to bypass flood flows around the dam  a computer
and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood   
hydropower sustainability  
as with other forms of economic activity  hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact  because the construction of a dam and power plant  along with the impounding of a reservoir  creates certain social and physical changes 
a number of tools have been developed to assist projects 
most new hydropower project must undergo an   this provides a base line understand of the pre project conditions  estimates potential impacts and puts in place management plans to avoid  mitigate  or compensate for impacts 
the
is another tool which can be used to promote and guide more sustainable hydropower projects  it is a methodology used to audit the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental  social  technical and economic topics  a protocol assessment provides a rapid sustainability health check  it does not replace an environmental and social impact assessment  esia   which takes place over a much longer period of time  usually as a mandatory regulatory requirement 
the
final report describes a framework for planning water and energy projects that is intended to protect dam-affected people and the environment  and ensure that the benefits from dams are more equitably distributed 
 s environmental and social performance standards define ifc clients  responsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks 
the s safeguard policies are used by the bank to help identify  avoid  and minimize harms to people and the environment caused by investment projects 
the
is a risk management framework  adopted by financial institutions  for determining  assessing and managing environmental and social risk in projects 
reservoirs accumulate plant material  which then decomposes  emitting
