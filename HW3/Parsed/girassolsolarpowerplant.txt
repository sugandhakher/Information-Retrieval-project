the moura photovoltaic power station  also known as amareleja photovoltaic power station  is a large
in   in the municipality of   portugal  it is one of the largest power stations of its kind  and is built in one of the sunniest regions in europe  its construction involved two stages  stage 1 was completed in 2008 after 13 months  and stage 2 was completed in 2010  the entire project topped a total cost of 250 million 
stage 2 of the project involved the construction of a further 20mw of solar panels  it will occupy an area of 618 acres  250ha   and will be capable of producing 93 of electrical energy annually  10 mw average - equivalent to the electricity consumption of 15,000 europeans  
the power station has an installed capacity of 62  with more than 376,000   approximately 190,000 panels  32mw  are fitted on fixed structures  and 52,000 panels  10mw  are fixed on  
a 7.6 million solar panel factory  located in moura  was constructed by   which provided panels for stage 2 of the station construction  its future production will be targeted at the international market  with a capacity of producing 24mw of solar panels annually
