the lincs wind farm is a 270mw offshore
8 kilometres  5.0mi  off
on the east coast of   the total cost of the project is estimated at 1billion including electrical transmission links  the farm was completed in 2013  it is adjacent to the smaller

history  
acquired the lincs wind farm project in 2004 from   in 2008 the company obtained planning permission for the project 
in december 2009
and
jointly acquired 50  of the project  25  share each  for 50million  plus 50  of the capital cost of the project 
preparatory construction work for the development included the extension of the
electricity substation at   which began in april 2009  in june 2010 siemens obtained the contract for the offshore electrical substation  101million   transmission cables from offshore to onshore
were installed in 20102011  construction of the offshore facilities of the wind farm began in 2011  with the installation of the offshore
foundations  the
was selected as one of the logistics bases for the wind farm turbine installation  supplying wind tower transition pieces 
jb114 arriving at the port in march 2012 
was also used as a base for the wind farm installation 
construction of the offshore 33kv to 132kv substation  structure sub-contracted to     and of the onshore 132kv to 400kv substation was completed by april 2012 
in august 2011  the consortia of dong  siemens  and centrica began to seek financing for the 1billion project  committing to providing 166.7  75 and 333.3million respectively  575million total   in june 2012 the consortia obtained financing for the project with 425million of
facilities provided from a consortium of 10 banks  approximately 75   of the project cost was for the wind farm installation  the remainder for the high voltage electricity transmission link 
construction began in 2010  installation of the 75-monopile tower foundation by
was completed by june 2012  with the underwater installation phase completed by september 2012  the first generator had been installed by 14 july 2012  the wind farm was scheduled become operational in the second half of 2012  and be complete by 2013  the final turbine was installed by march 2013  and the wind farm officially opened by deputy prime minister
in august 2013  with commissioning complete in september 2013  the license for the electrical transmission link was awarded to tc lincs ofto limited for 308million in late 2014 
technical description  
the scheme has 250mw of generating capacity  with an additional 20mw of turbine generating capacity constructed within the nearby
but connected to the lincs project transmission system  the project uses 75 three blade 3.6mw siemens wind turbines  the wind turbines have 120 metres  390ft  rotor diameter machines with 58.5 metres  192ft  blades with a hub height of 100 metres  330ft  on cylindrical steel towers  the turbines were installed in 10 to 15 metres  33 to 49ft  water depth  with a spacing of approximately 500 metres  1,600ft  within a 35 square kilometres  14sqmi  wind farm 
transmission of electrical power to land is by 145kv cables supplied by   transmission voltage is 132kv to land  being increased to 400kv at walpole substation for grid connection 
the operation and maintenance base for the wind farm is be based at  
the wind farm has an expected lifespan of 40 years  with electrical equipment and wind turbines expected to be replaced after 20 years  after the end of the project s lifespan the farm is to be decommissioned  including removal of turbines and electrical equipment  and removal of offshore foundations or cut off to
level or lower  connecting cables are not scheduled to be removed

notes  
lincs  docking shoal and race bank wind farms were to share the same onshore cable export route  and onshore substation  the environmental statement for the onshore works was submitted as part of the lincs wind farm application
