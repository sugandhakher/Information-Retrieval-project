iea solar heating   cooling implementing agreement - task 13  solar low energy buildings  was an international effort organised by one of the  s implementing agreements to build several solar   this took place between 1989 and 1993     the implementing agreement for a programme to develop and test solar heating and cooling systems is one of 40 research and development and deployment programmes  which are at the core of the iea s international energy technology co-operation programme 
the idea behind task 13 was to push
technology towards its limits to achieve the lowest possible total purchased
consumption  task 13 was part of the
solar heating and cooling programme  to test the designs and techniques  and to monitor their performance

design  
on average  the houses were designed to required 44  m  75  lower than the average 172 kwh m that would have been required had the houses been built to normal standards   analysis of 11 of the houses in use indicated that total savings made in practice was actually 60    the 44 kwh m resulted from 
 18 kwh m
 14 kwh m
water heating  11 kwh m
cooling  1 kwh m
in addition there was an average solar contribution designed to average 37 kwh m  from a combination of
gains    and  
the buildings were constructed to be   be
to roughly double normal standards  and to minimise  
and several
methods were represented  along with a novel
strengthened
block walls were used  the berlin  zero heating energy house  included a 20m  700 cubic feet   
the buildings  
the homes in the programme were 
pleiade row house  louvain-la-neuve  belgium
brampton advanced house  canada
waterloo region green home  canada
kolding row house  denmark
iea 5 house  pietarsaari 
ultrahouse  rottweil  germany
zero heating energy house  berlin  germany
wish house 3  iwaki  japan
urban villa  amstelveen 
iea task 13 house  hamar  norway
roskar low energy house  sweden
duplex in gelterkinden  switzerland
exemplary house  grand canyon  united states
exemplary house  yosemite  usa
lessons learned  
among the lessons learned were that 
airtightness was difficult to achieve
ventilation systems could suffer from noise and draft problems
care was needed to design out summer overheating
simple installations and systems were easier for the residents to understand
