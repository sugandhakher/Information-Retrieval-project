endangered species in the united states  
there is data from the united states that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species  using species data from the database on the economics and management of endangered species  demes  database and the period that the
 esa  has been in existence  1970 to 1997  a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment  as early as the 1800s  humans began noticing the decline of certain species of animals in their usual habitats  an example is the whooping crane  once abundant from canada to mexico  it was estimated in 1941 that only 16 birds remained in the wild  another early example of mankind noticing the extinction of species was the introduction of kudzu in the southern united states  this fast-growing plant took over the south  growing on plants and trees and squelching the life out of them  how many endangered species are there in us 
according to information of iucn red list there are around 391 endangered species occur in united states 
endangered species act  
 endangered  in relation to  threatened  under the esa 
under the
in the   species may be listed as  endangered  or  threatened   the
 cicindela nevadica lincolniana  is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the esa  the us fish and wildlife service as well as the national marine fisheries service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species  and adding a particular species to the list can be a long  controversial process  wilcove   master  2008  p 414  
some endangered species laws are controversial  typical areas of controversy include  criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered  whether restrictions on land development constitute a  taking  of land by the   the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their lands  and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws  also lobbying from
and various industries like the  
industry  and   has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws 
the
lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species  under the   this policy has been reinstated 
being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers  this effect is potentially reducible  such as in china where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species 
another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the  shoot  shovel  and shut-up  method of clearing endangered species from an area of land  some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it  they have allegedly opted to silently kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat  thus removing the problem from their land  but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species  the effectiveness of the  which coined the term  endangered species  has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool  nineteen species have been delisted and recovered and 93  of listed species in the northeastern united states have a recovering or stable population 
currently  1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law  this approximation  however  does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the endangered species act  according to   approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates  excluding marine fish   seventeen percent of vascular plants  and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled  415 thus  in total  between seven and eighteen percent of the united states  known animals  fungi and plants are near extinction  416 this total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the united states under the endangered species act 
bald eagle
american bison
ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself  over-hunting and fishing has been a large and dangerous problem  of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind  the      
and
are some of the more well known examples  with the      
and
having been hunted to near-extinction  many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport  however  due to major efforts to prevent extinction  the bald eagle  or
is now under the category of least concern on the red list  a present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced  large whales like the blue whale  bowhead whale  finback whale  gray whale  sperm whale and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the endangered species list  actions have been taken to attempt reduction in whaling and increase population sizes  including prohibiting all whaling in united states waters  the formation of the cites treaty which protects all whales  along with the formation of the international whaling commission  iwc   but even though all of these movements have been put in place  countries such as japan continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of  scientific purposes   over-hunting  climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list and could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future 
invasive species  
main article 
the introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered  such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species  in some cases the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives  in other cases a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline  new species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance

captive breeding  
main article 
captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings  such as wildlife reserves  zoos and other conservation facilities  captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilize the population of the species that it will not disappear 
this technique has worked for many species for some time  with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of european and asian rulers  an example being the   however  captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds  e g  cranes  and fishes  e g     additionally  if the captive breeding population is too small  then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced
and reduce  
in 1981  the
 aza  created a
 ssp  in order to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding  with over 450 ssp plans  there are a number of endangered species that are covered by the aza with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population  created by taxon advisory groups  these programs are commonly created as a last resort effort  ssp programs regularly participate in species recovery  veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks  and a number of other wildlife conservation efforts  the aza s species survival plan also has breeding and transfer programs  both within and outside of aza - certified zoos and aquariums  some animals that are part of ssp programs are   lowland gorillas  and  
private farming  
black rhino
southern bluefin tuna
whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations  legal  for-profit  private farming does the opposite  it has substantially increased the populations of the southern
and southern   dr richard emslie  a scientific officer at the iucn  said of such programs   effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned    we have been able to bring local communities into the conservation programmes  there are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching  from eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit  so many owners are keeping them secure  the private sector has been key to helping our work  
conservation experts view the effect of china s
on the wild turtle populations of china and south-eastern asia many of which are endangered as  poorly understood   although they commend the gradual replacement of turtles caught wild with
in the marketplace the percentage of farm-raised individuals in the  visible  trade grew from around 30  in 2000 to around 70  in 2007 they worry that many wild animals are caught to provide farmers with breeding stock  the conservation expert peter paul van dijk noted that turtle farmers often believe that animals caught wild are superior breeding stock  turtle farmers may  therefore  seek and catch the last remaining wild specimens of some endangered turtle species 
in 2009  researchers in australia managed to coax
to breed in landlocked tanks  raising the possibility that
may be able to save the species from  
countries with endangered animals  
around the world hundreds of thousands of species are lost to extinction  many of them only discovered as remains  after they are gone  thus  not only biological variability  but also genetic diversity  and perhaps sources of livelihood for future generations are lost  endangered species are species that may become extinct in the near future  throughout history millions of species have disappeared  due to natural processes  in the past 300 years  however  humans have increased the rate of extinction   
for some plant and animal species  living seems to be a daily hazard  and humans seem to pose the biggest threat  ecological disasters  hunting poaching  deforestation and other consequences of human action causes damage to the food chain  breeding grounds  and habitat
