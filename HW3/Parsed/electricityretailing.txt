beginnings  
electricity
began at the end of the 19th century when the bodies which generated electricity for their own use made supply available to third parties  in the beginning  electricity was primarily used for street
and   the public could buy once large scale electric companies had been started 
the provision of these services was generally the responsibility of electric companies or
who either set up their own departments or contracted the services from private entrepreneurs  residential  commercial and industrial use of electricity was confined  initially  to lighting but this changed dramatically with the development of  
and
devices 
the basic principle of supply has not changed much over time  the amount of energy used by the domestic consumer  and thus the amount charged for  is measured through an
that is usually placed near the input of a home to provide easy access to the meter reader   
customers are usually charged a monthly service fee and additional charges based on the electrical energy  in   consumed by the household or business during the month  commercial and industrial consumers normally have more complex pricing schemes  these require meters that measure the energy usage in time intervals  such as a half-hour  to impose charges based on both the amount of energy consumed and the maximum rate of consumption  i e  the maximum demand  which is measured in    
monopoly supply  
the rapid growth in electric appliance usage in the early part of the 20th century contributed to an explosive growth in
around the world 
the supply of electricity to homes  offices  shops  factories  farms  and mines became the responsibility of   which were either private organizations subject to
or public authorities owned by local  state or national bodies 
in some countries a statutory or
was created  which was controlled by legislation  for example
in     
electricity retailing in the period from approximately 1890 to 1990 consisted of managing the connection  disconnection and billing of electricity consumers by the local monopoly supplier 
in many utilities there was a
function which encouraged electricity usage when there was excess capacity to supply and encouraged conservation when supply was tight   
creating a market  
an electricity provider is often known as  the   or  the power company  
in 1990 there was a significant development in the way electricity was bought and sold  in many countries  the
was
to open up the supply of electricity to competition  in the
the
was radically reformed to establish competition  including a market in   this trend continued in other countries  see
and   and the role of electricity retailing changed from what was essentially an administrative function within an integrated utility to become a risk management function within a competitive  
electricity retailers now offer fixed prices or variable for electricity to their customers and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from
or   this development has not been without casualties  the most notable example of poor risk management  coupled with poor market regulation  was the   when
and
were driven into bankruptcy by having to purchase electricity at high spot prices and sell at low fixed rates 
customers may choose from a number of competing suppliers  they may also opt to purchase   i e  electricity sourced from

united states  
over the past several decades  many us states have moved to deregulate their electric markets  with 24 states allowing for at least some competition among retail electric providers  reps  including     and   these companies include             and
among many others  deregulation of electric retailers has been subject to much controversy as more states have opted for competitive markets
