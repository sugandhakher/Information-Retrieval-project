the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  is an
negotiated at the
in
from 3 to 14 june 1992  then entered into force on 21 march 1994  the unfccc objective is to  stabilize
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous
with the    the framework set no binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contains no enforcement mechanisms  instead  the framework outlines how specific international treaties  called  protocols  or  agreements   may be negotiated to set binding limits on greenhouse gases 
initially an intergovernmental negotiating committee produced the text of the framework convention during its meeting in new york from 30 april to 9 may 1992  the unfccc was adopted on 9 may 1992  and opened for signature on 4 june 1992  unfccc has 197 parties as of december 2015  the convention enjoys broad legitimacy  largely due to its nearly universal membership 
the parties to the convention have met annually from 1995 in
 cop  to assess progress in dealing with   in 1997  the
was concluded and established legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the period 2008-2012  the 2010
state that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0c  3.6f  relative to the pre-industrial level  the protocol was amended in 2012 to encompass the period 2013-2020 in the doha amendment  which -as of december 2015- not entered into force  in 2015 the
was adopted  governing emission reductions from 2020 on through commitments of countries in ambitious nationally determined contributions 
one of the first tasks set by the unfccc was for signatory nations to establish
of
 ghg  emissions and removals  which were used to create the 1990 benchmark levels for accession of annex i countries to the kyoto protocol and for the commitment of those countries to ghg reductions  updated inventories must be regularly submitted by annex i countries 
the unfccc is also the name of the
charged with supporting the operation of the convention  with offices in   and un campus  known as  langer eugen    from 2006 to 2010 the head of the secretariat was   on 17 may 2010 
from costa rica succeeded de boer  the secretariat  augmented through the parallel efforts of the
 ipcc   aims to gain consensus through meetings and the discussion of various strategies

treaty  
the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  was opened for signature at the 1992
 unced  in
 known by its popular title  the    on 12 june 1992  154 nations signed the unfccc  that upon ratification committed signatories  governments to reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases with the goal of  preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with earth s climate system   this commitment would require substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  see the later section   
article 3 1  of the convention states that parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of  common but differentiated responsibilities   and that developed country parties should  take the lead  in addressing climate change  under article 4  all parties make general commitments to address climate change through  for example  climate change mitigation and adapting to the eventual impacts of climate change  article 4 7  states 
the extent to which developing country parties will effectively implement their commitments under the convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country parties of their commitments under the convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and
are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country parties 
the framework convention specifies the aim of developed  annex i  parties stabilizing their greenhouse gas emissions   and other anthropogenic greenhouse gases not regulated under the   at 1990 levels  by the year 2000 
kyoto protocol  
main article 
after the signing of the unfccc treaty  parties to the unfccc have met at conferences      cops  to discuss how to achieve the treaty s aims  at the
 cop-1   parties decided that the aim of annex i parties stabilizing their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 was  not adequate   and further discussions at later conferences led to the   the kyoto protocol sets emissions targets for developed countries which are binding under international law 
the kyoto protocol has had two commitment periods  the first of which lasted from 2008-2012  the second one runs from 2013-2020 and is based on the doha amendment to the protocol  which has not entered into force 
the us has not ratified the kyoto protocol  while canada denounced it in 2012  the kyoto protocol has been ratified by all the other annex i parties 
all annex i parties  excluding the us  have participated in the 1st kyoto commitment period  37 annex i countries and the eu have agreed to second-round kyoto targets  these countries are australia  all members of the european union  belarus  croatia  iceland  kazakhstan  norway  switzerland  and ukraine  belarus  kazakhstan and ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the protocol or not put into legal force the amendment with second round targets  japan  new zealand  and russia have participated in kyoto s first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period  other developed countries without second-round targets are canada  which withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2012  and the united states 
paris agreement  
main article 
in 2011  parties adopted the  durban platform for enhanced action   as part of the durban platform  parties have agreed to  develop a protocol  another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the convention applicable to all parties   at durban and doha  parties noted  with grave concern  that current efforts to hold global warming to below 2 or 1.5c relative to the pre-industrial level appear inadequate 
in 2015  all  then  196 then parties to the convention came together for the
in paris 30 november - 12 december and adopted by consensus the paris agreement  aimed at limiting global warming to less than two degrees celsius  and pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees celsius  the
is to be signed in 2016 and will enter into force upon ratification by 55 countries representing over 55  of greenhouse gas emissions 
other decisions  
in addition to the kyoto protocol  and its amendment  and the paris agreement  parties to the convention have agreed to further commitments during unfccc conferences of the parties  these include the
 2007   the
 2009   the
 2010   and the
 2012  
bali action plan
as part of the bali action plan  adopted in 2007  all developed country parties have agreed to  quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives  while ensuring the comparability of efforts among them  taking into account differences in their national circumstances   developing country parties agreed to   nationally  appropriate mitigation actions  namas  context of sustainable development  supported and enabled by technology  financing and capacity-building  in a measurable  reportable and verifiable manner   42 developed countries have submitted mitigation targets to the unfccc secretariat  as have 57 developing countries and the
 a group of countries within the un  
copenhagen accord and cancn agreements
as part of the 2009 copenhagen negotiations  a number of countries produced the   the accord states that global warming should be limited to below 2.0c  3.6f   this may be strengthened in 2015 with a target to limit warming to below 1.5c  the accord does not specify what the baseline is for these temperature targets  e g   relative to pre-industrial or 1990 temperatures   according to the unfccc  these targets are relative to pre-industrial temperatures 
114 countries agreed to the accord  the unfccc secretariat notes that  some parties       stated in their communications to the secretariat specific understandings on the nature of the accord and related matters  based on which they have agreed to  the accord    the accord was not formally adopted by the conference of the parties  instead  the cop  took note of the copenhagen accord  
as part of the accord  17 developed country parties and the eu-27 have submitted mitigation targets  as have 45 developing country parties  some developing country parties have noted the need for international support in their plans 
as part of the cancn agreements  developed and developing countries have submitted mitigation plans to the unfccc  these plans are compiled with those made as part of the bali action plan 
developing countries
at berlin  cancn  and durban  the development needs of developing country parties were reiterated  for example  the durban platform reaffirms that 
      social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing country parties  and that a low-emission development strategy is central to sustainable development  and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs
interpreting article 2  
further information 
the ultimate objective of the framework convention is to prevent  dangerous  anthropogenic  i e   human-caused  interference of the climate system  as is stated in article 2 of the convention  this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where
can adapt naturally to climate change 
is not threatened  and
can proceed in a sustainable fashion 
climate change mitigation scenarios  projected global greenhouse gas emissions  years 2000 to 2100
climate change mitigation scenarios  projected changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations  years 2000 to 2100
climate change mitigation scenarios  projected global mean temperature  years 2000 to 2100
to stabilize atmospheric ghg concentrations  global anthropogenic ghg emissions would need to peak then decline  see    lower stabilization levels would require emissions to peak and decline earlier compared to higher stabilization levels  the graph above shows projected changes in annual global ghg emissions  measured in co2-equivalents  for various stabilization scenarios  the other two graphs show the associated changes in atmospheric ghg concentrations  in co2-equivalents  and global mean temperature for these scenarios  lower stabilization levels are associated with lower magnitudes of global warming compared to higher stabilization levels 
projected global warming in 2100 for a range of emission scenarios
there is uncertainty over how ghg concentrations and global temperatures will change in response to anthropogenic emissions  see
and    the graph opposite shows global temperature changes in the year 2100 for a range of emission scenarios  including uncertainty estimates 
dangerous anthropogenic interference
further information 
and
there are a range of views over what level of climate change is dangerous  scientific analysis can provide information on the risks of climate change  but deciding which risks are dangerous requires value judgements 
the global warming that has already occurred poses a risk to some human and natural systems  e g   coral reefs   higher magnitudes of global warming will generally increase the risk of negative impacts  according to field et al   2014   climate change risks are  considerable  with 1 to 2c of global warming  relative to pre-industrial levels  4c warming would lead to significantly increased risks  with potential impacts including widespread loss of
and reduced global and regional  
climate change policies may lead to costs that are relevant to article 2  for example  more stringent policies to control ghg emissions may reduce the risk of more severe climate change  but may also be more expensive to implement 
projections
there is considerable uncertainty over future changes in anthropogenic ghg emissions  atmospheric ghg concentrations  and associated climate change  without mitigation policies  increased energy demand and extensive use of fossil fuels could lead to global warming  in 2100  of 3.7 to 4.8c relative to pre-industrial levels  2.5 to 7.8c including climate uncertainty  
to have a likely chance of limiting global warming  in 2100  to below 2c  ghg concentrations would need to be limited to around 450 ppm co2-eq  the current trajectory of global emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2c 
precautionary principle  
in decision making  the
is considered when possibly dangerous  irreversible  or catastrophic events are identified  but scientific evaluation of the potential damage is not sufficiently certain  toth et al   2001  pp 655656   the precautionary principle implies an emphasis on the need to prevent such adverse effects 
uncertainty is associated with each link of the causal chain of climate change  for example  future ghg emissions are uncertain  as are climate change damages  however  following the precautionary principle  uncertainty is not a reason for inaction  and this is acknowledged in article 3.3 of the unfccc  toth et al   2001  p 656

commentaries and analysis  
criticisms of the unfccc process  
the overall umbrella and processes of the unfccc and the adopted kyoto protocol have been criticized by some as not having achieved its stated goals of reducing the emission of
 the primary culprit blamed for rising global temperatures of the 21st century   at a speech given at his alma mater  todd stern the us climate change envoy has expressed the challenges with the unfccc process as follows  climate change is not a conventional environmental issue   it implicates virtually every aspect of a state s economy  so it makes countries nervous about growth and development  this is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one  he went on to explain that  the united nations framework convention on climate change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy  because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus  small groups of countries can often block progress 
the failure to achieve meaningful progress and reach effective-co2 reducing-policy treaties among the parties over the past eighteen years have driven some countries like the united states to never ratify the unfccc s largest body of work the kyoto protocol  in large part because the treaty didn t cover developing countries who now include the largest co2 emitters  however  this fails to consider the historical responsibility for climate change since industrialisation  which is a contentious issue in the talks  and the responsibility of emissions from consumption and importation of goods  it has also led canada to withdraw from the kyoto protocol out of a desire to not force its citizens to pay penalties that would result in wealth transfers out of canada  canada formally withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2011  both the us and canada are looking at
schemes that they can implement internally to curb carbon dioxide emissions outside the kyoto protocol 
the perceived lack of progress has also led some countries to seek and focus on alternative high-value activities like the creation of the
which seeks to regulate short-lived pollutants such as methane 
and
 hfcs  which together are believed to account for up to 1/3 of current global warming but whose regulation is not as fraught with wide economic impacts and opposition 
in 2010  japan stated that it will not sign up to a second kyoto term  because it would impose restrictions on it not faced by its main economic competitors  china  india and indonesia  a similar indication was given by the prime minister of new zealand in november 2012  at the 2012 conference  last minute objections at the conference by russia   
and
were ignored by the governing officials  and they have indicated that they will likely withdraw or not ratify the treaty  these defections place additional pressures on the unfccc process that is seen by some as cumbersome and expensive  in the uk alone the climate change department has taken over 3,000 flights in two years at a cost of over 1,300,000  british pounds  
before the  
added criticism  writing   since 1992  when the worlds nations agreed at rio de janeiro to avoid  dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system   theyve met 20 times without moving the needle on carbon emissions  in that interval weve added almost as much carbon to the atmosphere as we did in the previous century  
benchmarking  
is the setting of a policy target based on some frame of reference  an example of benchmarking is the unfccc s original target of annex i parties limiting their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000  goldemberg et al   1996  commented on the economic implications of this target  although the target applies equally to all annex i parties  the economic costs of meeting the target would likely vary between parties  for example  countries with initially high levels of
might find it more costly to meet the target than countries with lower levels of energy efficiency  from this perspective  the unfccc target could be viewed as   i e   unfair 
benchmarking has also been discussed in relation to the first-round emissions targets specified in the
