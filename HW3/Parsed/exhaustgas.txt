jump to 					 
a diesel-powered truck emits an exhaust gas rich in black particulate matter when starting its engine 
exhaust gas or
is emitted as a result of the
of fuels such as     petrol  biodiesel blends      or   according to the type of engine  it is discharged into the atmosphere through an     or   it often disperses downwind in a pattern called an exhaust plume 
it is a major component of motor vehicle emissions  and from stationary internal combustion engines   which can also include 
blow-by
evaporation of unused gasoline
motor vehicle emissions contribute to
and are a major ingredient in the creation of
in some large cities  a 2013 study by
indicates that 53,000 early deaths occur per year in the united states alone because of vehicle emissions  according to another study from the same university  traffic fumes alone cause the death of 5,000 people every year just in the united kingdom

composition  
the largest part of most combustion gas is
 n2   water vapor  h2o   except with pure-carbon fuels   and
 co2   except for fuels without carbon   these are not toxic or noxious  although carbon dioxide is a
that contributes to    a relatively small part of combustion gas is undesirable noxious or toxic substances  such as
 co  from incomplete combustion 
 properly indicated as cxhy  but typically shown simply as  hc  on emissions-test slips  from unburnt fuel 
 nox  from excessive combustion temperatures  and
 mostly   
exhaust gas temperature  
exhaust gas temperature  egt  is important to the functioning of the
of an   it may be measured by an   egt is also a measure of engine health in gas-turbine engines  see below  
cold engines  
steam from tailpipe of cold car
during the first two minutes after starting the engine of a car that has not been operated for several hours  the amount of emissions can be very high  this occurs for two main reasons 
rich air-fuel ratio requirement in cold engines  when a cold engine is started  the fuel does not vaporize completely  creating higher emissions of  
and   which diminishes only as the engine reaches operating temperature  the duration of this start-up phase has been reduced by advances in materials and technology  including   shorter intake lengths  and pre-heating of fuel and or inducted air 
inefficient catalytic converter under cold conditions  catalytic converters are very inefficient until up to their   this time has been much reduced by moving the converter closer to the exhaust manifold and even more so placing a small yet quick-to-heat-up converter directly at the exhaust manifold  the small converter handles the start-up emissions  which allows enough time for the larger main converter to heat up  further improvements can be realised in many ways  including electric heating  thermal battery  chemical reaction preheating  flame heating and superinsulation

gas-turbine engines  
in aircraft gas turbine engines   exhaust gas temperature   egt  is a primary measure of engine health  typically the egt is compared with a primary engine power indication called  engine pressure ratio   epr   for example  at full power epr there will be a maximum permitted egt limit  once an engine reaches a stage in its life where it reaches this egt limit  the engine will require specific maintenance in order to rectify the problem  the amount the egt is below the egt limit is called egt margin  the egt margin of an engine will be greatest when the engine is new  or has been overhauled  for most airlines  this information is also monitored remotely by the airline maintenance department by means of

one of the advantages claimed for
engines is that they produce smaller quantities of toxic pollutants  e g  oxides of nitrogen  than petrol and diesel engines of the same power    they produce larger quantities of carbon dioxide but less carbon monoxide due to more efficient combustion

researchers from the university of california  los angeles school of public health say preliminary results of their statistical study of children listed in the california cancer registry born between 1998 and 2007 found that traffic pollution may be associated with a 5  to 15  increase in the likelihood of some cancers  a
study found that diesel fumes cause an increase in lung cancer
