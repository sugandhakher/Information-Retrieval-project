the table presented here shows the classification of blood pressure adopted by the american heart association for adults who are 18 years and older  it assumes the values are a result of averaging resting blood pressure readings measured at two or more visits to the doctor 
in the   clinic blood pressures are usually categorized into three groups  low  90/60 or lower   normal  between 90/60 and 139/89   and high  140/90 or higher  
blood pressure fluctuates from minute to minute and normally shows a circadian rhythm over a 24-hour period  with highest readings in the early morning and evenings and lowest readings at night  loss of the normal fall in blood pressure at night is associated with a greater future risk of cardiovascular disease and there is evidence that night-time blood pressure is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than day-time blood pressure 
various factors  such as age and sex  influence a person s blood pressure and variations in it  in children  the normal ranges are lower than for adults and depend on height  reference blood pressure values have been developed for children in different countries  based on the distribution of blood pressure in children of these countries  as adults age  systolic pressure tends to rise and diastolic tends to fall  in the elderly  systolic blood pressure tends to be above the normal adult range  thought to be largely because of reduced flexibility of the arteries  also  an individual s blood pressure varies with exercise  emotional reactions  sleep  digestion and time of day    
differences between left and right arm blood pressure measurements tend to be random and average to nearly zero if enough measurements are taken  however  in a small percentage of cases there is a consistent difference greater than 10mmhg which may need further investigation  e g  for  
the risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively above 115/75mmhg  in the past 
was only diagnosed if secondary signs of high arterial pressure were present  along with a prolonged high systolic pressure reading over several visits  regarding hypotension  in practice blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable
are present 
clinical trials demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health  the principal medical debate concerns the aggressiveness and relative value of methods used to lower pressures into this range for those who do not maintain such pressure on their own  elevations  more commonly seen in older people  though often considered normal  are associated with increased

blood pressure generally refers to the arterial pressure in the   however  measurement of pressures in the venous system and the

but requires invasive measurement of pressure using a  
venous pressure is the vascular pressure in a

variants of venous pressure include

main article 
overview of main complications of persistent high blood pressure 
can be an indicator of other problems and may have long-term adverse effects  sometimes it can be an acute problem  for example  
levels of arterial pressure put mechanical stress on the arterial walls  higher pressures increase heart workload and progression of unhealthy tissue growth    that develops within the walls of arteries  the higher the pressure  the more stress that is present and the more
tend to progress and the
tends to thicken  enlarge and become weaker over time 
persistent
is one of the risk factors for    
and arterial aneurysms  and is the leading cause of   even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened   at severely high pressures  mean arterial pressures 50  or more above average  a person can expect to live no more than a few years unless appropriately treated 
in the past  most attention was paid to
pressure  but nowadays it is recognised that both high
pressure and high
 the numerical difference between systolic and diastolic pressures  are also risk factors  in some cases  it appears that a decrease in excessive diastolic pressure can actually increase risk  due probably to the increased difference between systolic and diastolic pressures  see the article on    if systolic blood pressure is elevated   140mmhg  with a normal diastolic blood pressure   90mmhg   it is called  isolated systolic hypertension  and may present a health concern 
for those with
regurgitation  a change in its severity may be associated with a change in diastolic pressure  in a study of people with heart valve regurgitation that compared measurements 2 weeks apart for each person  there was an increased severity of
and
when diastolic blood pressure increased  whereas when diastolic blood pressure decreased  there was a decreased severity

blood pressure that is too low is known as   hypotension is a medical concern if it causes signs or symptoms  such as dizziness  fainting  or in extreme cases   
when arterial pressure and blood
decrease beyond a certain point  the
of the brain becomes critically decreased  i e   the blood supply is not sufficient   causing lightheadedness  dizziness  weakness or fainting 
sometimes the arterial pressure drops significantly when a patient stands up from sitting  this is known as
 postural hypotension   gravity reduces the rate of blood return from the body veins below the heart back to the heart  thus reducing stroke volume and cardiac output   
when people are healthy  the veins below their heart quickly constrict and the heart rate increases to minimize and compensate for the gravity effect  this is carried out involuntarily by the autonomic nervous system  the system usually requires a few seconds to fully adjust and if the compensations are too slow or inadequate  the individual will suffer reduced blood flow to the brain  dizziness and potential blackout  increases in g-loading  such as routinely experienced by aerobatic or combat pilots     greatly increases this effect  repositioning the body perpendicular to gravity largely eliminates the problem   
other causes of low arterial pressure include   
 blood loss
including toxic doses of blood pressure medicine
abnormalities  such as
  particularly
and
is a complex condition which leads to critically decreased   the usual mechanisms are loss of blood volume  pooling of blood within the veins reducing adequate return to the heart and or low effective heart pumping  low arterial pressure  especially low pulse pressure  is a sign of shock and contributes to and reflects decreased perfusion   
if there is a significant difference in the pressure from one arm to the other  that may indicate a narrowing  for example  due to    
or   of an    
fluctuating blood pressure  
normal fluctuation in blood pressure is adaptive and necessary  fluctuations in pressure that are significantly greater than the norm are associated with greater   a finding consistent with reduced local cerebral blood flow and a heightened risk of
disease  within both high and low blood pressure groups  a greater degree of fluctuation was found to correlate with an increase in cerebrovascular disease compared to those with less variability  suggesting the consideration of the clinical management of blood pressure fluctuations  even among
older adults  older individuals and those who had received blood pressure medications were more likely to exhibit larger fluctuations in pressure 
physiology  
systole on the left and diastole on the right
during each heartbeat  blood pressure varies between a maximum  systolic  and a minimum  diastolic  pressure  the blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart  differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation  the rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels  mean blood pressure decreases as the
moves away from the
through arteries and
due to
losses of energy  mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation  although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and   gravity affects blood pressure via
forces  e g   during standing   and valves in veins    and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins 
hemodynamics  
main article 
most influences on blood pressure can be understood in terms of their effect on cardiac output and resistance  the determinants of mean arterial pressure  
some factors are 
  the greater the blood volume  the higher the cardiac output  there is some relationship between dietary salt intake and increased blood volume  potentially resulting in higher arterial pressure  though this varies with the individual and is highly dependent on autonomic nervous system response and the  
cardiac output  the pumping action of the heart is ultimately responsible for blood pressure  increases or decreases in cardiac output can result in increases or decreases respectively in blood pressure 
systemic vascular resistance  the higher the resistance to blood flow  the higher the arterial pressure upstream needs to be to maintain flow  in simple terms  resistance is related to vessel radius by the
 resistance1 radius4  so the smaller the radius  the very much higher the resistance   other physical factors that affect resistance include  vessel length  the longer the vessel  the higher the resistance   blood viscosity  the higher the viscosity  the higher the resistance  and the presence of an arterial
 a narrow stenosis increases resistance to flow  however this increase in resistance rarely if ever increases systemic blood pressure  it decreases downstream flow   substances called
can reduce the calibre of blood vessels  thereby increasing blood pressure 
 such as   increase the calibre of blood vessels  thereby decreasing arterial pressure 
in practice  each individual s autonomic nervous system and other systems regulating blood pressure respond to and regulate all these factors so that  although the above issues are important  they rarely act in isolation and the actual arterial pressure response of a given individual can vary widely in the short and long-term 
regulation  
main article 
the
regulation of arterial pressure is not completely understood  but the following mechanisms of regulating arterial pressure have been well-characterized 
 
in the
detect changes in arterial pressure  these baroreceptors send signals ultimately to the   specifically to the
 rvlm   the medulla  by way of the   adjusts the mean arterial pressure by altering both the force and speed of the heart s contractions  as well as the systemic vascular resistance  the most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the left and right
and in the  
 ras   this system is generally known for its long-term adjustment of arterial pressure  this system allows the
to compensate for loss in
or drops in arterial pressure by activating an endogenous
known as  
release  this
is released from the
in response to angiotensin ii or high serum
levels  aldosterone stimulates
retention and potassium excretion by the kidneys  since sodium is the main ion that determines the amount of fluid in the blood vessels by   aldosterone will increase fluid retention  and indirectly  arterial pressure 
in
 mainly in the
and the   and in the   result in feedback by regulating the secretion of
 adh vasopressin  
and   the resultant increase in
results in an increased
by the   in turn increasing arterial blood pressure 
these different mechanisms are not necessarily independent of each other  as indicated by the link between the ras and aldosterone release  when blood pressure falls many physiological cascades commence in order to return the blood pressure to a more appropriate level 
the blood pressure fall is detected by a decrease in blood flow and thus a decrease in
 gfr  
decrease in gfr is sensed as a decrease in na  levels by the  
the macula densa cause an increase in na  reabsorption  which causes water to follow in via
and leads to an ultimate increase in
volume  further  the macula densa releases adenosine which causes constriction of the afferent arterioles 
at the same time  the
sense the decrease in blood pressure and release  
renin converts
 inactive form  to
 active form  
angiotensin i flows in the bloodstream until it reaches the capillaries of the lungs where
 ace  acts on it to convert it into  
angiotensin ii is a vasoconstrictor which will increase bloodflow to the heart and subsequently the preload  ultimately increasing the  
angiotensin ii also causes an increase in the release of
from the  
aldosterone further increases the na  and h2o reabsorption in the
of the  
currently  the ras is targeted pharmacologically by
and   the aldosterone system is directly targeted by   an   the fluid retention may be targeted by   the antihypertensive effect of diuretics is due to its effect on blood volume  generally  the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in
because if blocked  individuals may suffer from

arterial pressure is most commonly measured via a   which historically used the height of a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure  blood pressure values are generally reported in
 mmhg   though aneroid and electronic devices do not contain  
for each heartbeat  blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures  systolic pressure is peak pressure in the arteries  which occurs near the end of the
when the
are contracting  diastolic pressure is minimum pressure in the arteries  which occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are filled with blood  an example of normal measured values for a resting  healthy adult human is 120mmhg
and 80mmhg
 written as 120/80mmhg  and spoken as  one-twenty over eighty   
systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures are not static but undergo natural variations from one heartbeat to another and throughout the day  in a
rhythm   they also change in response to   nutritional factors    disease  exercise  and   sometimes the variations are large 
refers to arterial pressure being abnormally high  as opposed to   when it is abnormally low  along with     and   blood pressure is one of the four main vital signs routinely monitored by medical professionals and healthcare providers 
measuring pressure   by penetrating the arterial wall to take the measurement  is much less common and usually restricted to a hospital setting 
non-invasive  
the non-invasive
and oscillometric measurements are simpler and quicker than invasive measurements  require less expertise  have virtually no complications  are less unpleasant and less painful for the patient  however  non-invasive methods may yield somewhat lower accuracy and small systematic differences in numerical results  non-invasive measurement methods are more commonly used for routine examinations and monitoring 
palpation  
a minimum systolic value can be roughly estimated by   most often used in   but should be used with caution  it has been estimated that  using 50    carotid  femoral and radial pulses are present in patients with a systolic blood pressure   70mmhg  carotid and femoral pulses alone in patients with systolic blood pressure of   50mmhg  and only a carotid pulse in patients with a systolic blood pressure of   40mmhg 
a more accurate value of systolic blood pressure can be obtained with a
and palpating the radial pulse  the diastolic blood pressure cannot be estimated by this method  the american heart association recommends that palpation be used to get an estimate before using the auscultatory method 
auscultatory  
auscultatory method aneroid sphygmomanometer with stethoscope
mercury manometer
the auscultatory method  from the latin word for  listening   uses a
and a   this comprises an inflatable   
placed around the upper
at roughly the same vertical height as the heart  attached to a mercury or
  the mercury manometer  considered the gold standard  measures the height of a column of mercury  giving an absolute result without need for calibration and  consequently  not subject to the errors and drift of calibration which affect other methods  the use of mercury manometers is often required in
and for the clinical measurement of
in high-risk patients  such as  
a cuff of the appropriate size is fitted smoothly and also snugly  then inflated manually by repeatedly squeezing a rubber bulb until the artery is completely occluded  it is important that the cuff size is correct  undersized cuffs record too high a pressure  oversized cuffs may yield too low a pressure  usually three or four cuff sizes should be available to allow measurements in arms of different size  listening with the stethoscope to the
at the
of the   the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff  when blood just starts to flow in the artery  the
creates a  whooshing  or pounding  first    the pressure at which this sound is first heard is the systolic blood pressure  the cuff pressure is further released until no sound can be heard  fifth korotkoff sound   at the diastolic arterial pressure 
the auscultatory method is the predominant method of clinical measurement 
oscillometric  
the oscillometric method was first demonstrated in 1876 and involves the observation of oscillations in the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure which are caused by the oscillations of   i e   the   the electronic version of this method is sometimes used in long-term measurements and general practice  it uses a sphygmomanometer cuff  like the auscultatory method  but with an electronic
   to observe cuff pressure oscillations  electronics to automatically interpret them  and automatic inflation and deflation of the cuff  the pressure sensor should be calibrated periodically to maintain accuracy 
oscillometric measurement requires less skill than the auscultatory technique and may be suitable for use by untrained staff and for automated patient home monitoring  as for the auscultatory technique it is important that the cuff size is appropriate for the arm  there are some single cuff devices that may be used for arms of differing sizes  although experience with these is limited 
the cuff is inflated to a pressure initially in excess of the systolic arterial pressure and then reduced to below diastolic pressure over a period of about 30seconds  when blood flow is nil  cuff pressure exceeding systolic pressure  or unimpeded  cuff pressure below diastolic pressure   cuff pressure will be essentially constant  when blood flow is present  but restricted  the cuff pressure  which is monitored by the pressure sensor  will vary periodically in synchrony with the cyclic expansion and contraction of the brachial artery  i e   it will  
over the deflation period  the recorded pressure waveform forms a signal known as the cuff deflation curve  a bandpass filter is utilized to extract the oscillometric pulses from the cuff deflation curve  over the deflation period  the extracted oscillometric pulses form a signal known as the oscillometric waveform  omw   the amplitude of the oscillometric pulses increases to a maximum and then decreases with further deflation  a variety of analysis algorithms can be employed in order to estimate the systolic  diastolic  and mean arterial pressure 
oscillometric monitors may produce inaccurate readings in patients with heart and circulation problems  which include         and  
in practice the different methods do not give identical results  an algorithm and experimentally obtained coefficients are used to adjust the oscillometric results to give readings which match the auscultatory results as well as possible  some equipment uses computer-aided analysis of the instantaneous arterial pressure
to determine the systolic  mean  and diastolic points  since many oscillometric devices have not been validated  caution must be given as most are not suitable in clinical and acute care settings 
recently  several coefficient-free oscillometric algorithms have developed for estimation of blood pressure  these algorithms do not rely on experimentally obtained coefficients and have been shown to provide more accurate and robust estimation of blood pressure  these algorithms are based on finding the fundamental relationship between the oscillometric waveform and the blood pressure using modeling and learning approaches 
the term nibp  for non-invasive blood pressure  is often used to describe oscillometric monitoring equipment 
continuous noninvasive techniques  cnap   
 cnap  is the method of measuring arterial blood pressure in real-time without any interruptions and without cannulating the human body  cnap combines the advantages of the following two clinical gold standards  it measures blood pressure continuously in real-time like the invasive
system and it is noninvasive like the standard upper arm   latest developments in this field show promising results in terms of accuracy  ease of use and clinical acceptance 
non-occlusive techniques  the pulse wave velocity  pwv  principle  
since the 1990s a novel family of techniques based on the so-called
 pwv  principle have been developed  these techniques rely on the fact that the velocity at which an arterial pressure pulse travels along the arterial tree depends  among others  on the underlying blood pressure  accordingly  after a calibration maneuver  these techniques provide indirect estimates of blood pressure by translating pwv values into blood pressure values 
the main advantage of these techniques is that it is possible to measure pwv values of a subject continuously  beat-by-beat   without medical supervision  and without the need of inflating brachial cuffs  pwv-based techniques are still in the research domain and are not adapted to clinical settings 
ambulatory and home monitoring  
devices take readings regularly  e g  every half-hour throughout the day and night   they have been used to exclude measurement problems like
and provide more reliable estimates of usual blood pressure and cardiovascular risk  blood pressure readings outside of a clinical setting are usually slightly lower in the majority of people  however studies that quantified the risks from
and the benefits of lowering blood pressure have mostly been based on readings in a clinical environment  use of ambulatory measurements is not widespread but guidelines developed by the uk national institute for health and care excellence and the british hypertension society recommended that 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be used for diagnosis of hypertension  health economic analysis suggested that this approach would be cost effective compared with repeated clinic measurements 
home monitoring is a cheap and simple alternative to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring  although it does not usually allow assessment of blood pressure during sleep which may be a disadvantage  automatic self-contained blood pressure monitors are available at reasonable prices  however measurements may not be accurate in patients with atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias such as frequent ectopic beats  home monitoring may be used to improve hypertension management and to monitor the effects of lifestyle changes and medication related to blood pressure  compared to ambulatory blood pressure measurements  home monitoring has been found to be an effective and lower cost alternative  but ambulatory monitoring is more accurate than both clinic and home monitoring in diagnosing hypertension 
when measuring blood pressure in the home  an accurate reading requires that one not drink coffee  smoke cigarettes  or engage in strenuous exercise for 30minutes before taking the reading  a full bladder may have a small effect on blood pressure readings  if the urge to urinate arises  one should do so before the reading  for 5minutes before the reading  one should sit upright in a chair with one s feet flat on the floor and with limbs uncrossed  the blood pressure cuff should always be against bare skin  as readings taken over a shirt sleeve are less accurate  the same arm should be used for all measurements  during the reading  the arm that is used should be relaxed and kept at heart level  for example by resting it on a table 
since blood pressure varies throughout the day  home measurements should be taken at the same time of day  a joint scientific statement from the american heart association  american society of hypertension  and preventive cardiovascular nurses association on home monitoring in 2008 recommended that 2 to 3 readings should be taken in the morning  after awakening  before washing dressing  taking breakfast drink or taking medication  and another 2 to 3 readings at night  each day over a period of 1 week  it was also recommended that the readings from the first day should be discarded and that a total of 12 readings  i e  at least two readings per day for the remaining 6 days of the week  should be used for making clinical decisions 
white-coat hypertension  
for some patients  blood pressure measurements taken in a doctor s office may not correctly characterize their typical blood pressure  in up to 25  of patients  the office measurement is higher than their typical blood pressure  this type of error is called
 wch  and can result from anxiety related to an examination by a health care professional  white coat hypertension can also occur because  in a clinical setting  patients are seldom given the opportunity to rest for five minutes before blood pressure readings are taken  the misdiagnosis of hypertension for these patients can result in needless and possibly harmful medication  wch can be reduced  but not eliminated  with automated blood pressure measurements over 15 to 20 minutes in a quiet part of the office or clinic  in some cases a lower blood pressure reading occurs at the doctor s - this has been termed  masked hypertension

invasive  
arterial blood pressure is most accurately measured invasively through an   invasive arterial pressure measurement with intravascular
involves direct measurement of arterial pressure by placing a cannula needle in an artery  usually    
or   
the cannula must be connected to a sterile  fluid-filled system  which is connected to an electronic pressure transducer  the advantage of this system is that pressure is constantly monitored beat-by-beat  and a waveform  a graph of pressure against time  can be displayed  this invasive technique is regularly employed in human and veterinary     and for research purposes 
cannulation for invasive vascular pressure monitoring is infrequently associated with complications such as     and   patients with invasive arterial monitoring require very close supervision  as there is a danger of severe bleeding if the line becomes disconnected  it is generally reserved for patients where rapid variations in arterial pressure are anticipated 
invasive vascular pressure monitors are pressure monitoring systems designed to acquire pressure information for display and processing  there are a variety of invasive vascular pressure monitors for trauma  critical care  and
applications  these include single pressure  dual pressure  and multi-parameter  i e  pressure   temperature   the monitors can be used for measurement and follow-up of arterial  central venous  pulmonary arterial  left atrial  right atrial  femoral arterial  umbilical venous  umbilical arterial  and intracranial pressures 
fetal blood pressure
