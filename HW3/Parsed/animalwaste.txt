animal manure is often a mixture of animal
and bedding straw  as in this example from a

in the past  the term manure included inorganic   but this usage is now very rare 
contents
types
there are three main classes of manures used in
management 
animal manure
cement reservoirs  one new  and one containing cow manure mixed with water  this is common in rural
province   
most animal manure consists of   common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure  fym  or farm slurry  liquid manure   fym also contains plant material  often straw   which has been used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and   agricultural manure in liquid form  known as   is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used  instead of straw bedding  manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer  for example               and
from
and
all have different properties  for instance  sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash  while pig manure is relatively low in both  horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds  as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do  chicken litter  coming from a bird  is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties 
animal manures may be adulterated or contaminated with other animal products  such as
  and other        and   livestock feed can be mixed with the manure due to spillage  for example  chickens are often fed   an animal product  which can end up becoming mixed with chicken litter 
human manure
main article 
some people refer to
as human manure  and the word    has also been used  just like animal manure  it can be applied as a soil conditioner   in agriculture  
is a material that contains human excreta  as it is generated after mixing excreta with water and treatment of the
in a  
compost containing turkey manure and wood chips from bedding material is dried and then applied to pastures for fertilizer 
compost
main article 
is the decomposed remnants of organic materials  it is usually of plant origin  but often includes some animal dung or bedding 
green manure
are crops grown for the express purpose of
them in  thus increasing fertility through the incorporation of nutrients and organic matter into the soil 
such as clover are often used for this  as they
using
bacteria in specialized
in the root structure 
other types of plant matter used as manure include the contents of the
of slaughtered  
 left over from
  and  
uses of manure
animal manure
manure on a wall 
animal manure  such as
and   has been used for centuries as a fertilizer for   it can improve the soil structure  aggregation  so that the soil holds more nutrients and water  and therefore becomes more fertile  animal manure also encourages soil microbial activity which promotes the soil s trace mineral supply  improving plant nutrition  it also contains some nitrogen and other nutrients that assist the growth of plants 
manures with a particularly
 such as slurries from   are usually knifed  injected  directly into the soil to reduce release of the odor  manure from pigs and cattle is usually spread on fields using a   due to the relatively lower level of proteins in vegetable matter 
manure has a milder smell than the dung of
or   however  herbivore slurry that has undergone anaerobic
may develop more unpleasant odors  and this can be a problem in some agricultural regions  poultry droppings are harmful to plants when fresh but  after a period of   are valuable fertilizers 
manure is also commercially composted and bagged and sold retail as a soil amendment   
before motor vehicles became common  horse droppings were a big part of the rubbish that communities needed to clean off roads 
precautions
manure generates
as it decomposes  and it is possible for manure to
if stored in a very large pile  once such a large pile of manure is burning  it will
over a wide area and require considerable effort to extinguish  therefore  large
must take care to ensure that piles of fresh manure do not get excessively large  there is no serious risk of spontaneous combustion in smaller operations   
there is also a risk of insects carrying feces to food and water supplies  making them unsuitable for human consumption 
livestock antibiotics
in 2007  a
study indicated that foods such as corn  lettuce  and potatoes have been found to accumulate
from soils spread with animal manure that contains these drugs 
may be much more or much less likely to contain antibiotics  depending on their sources and treatment of manure  for instance  by soil association standard 4.7.38  most organic arable farmers either have their own supply of manure  which would  therefore  not normally contain drug residues  or else rely on green manure crops for the extra fertility  if any nonorganic manure is used by organic farmers  then it usually has to be rotted or composted to degrade any residues of drugs and eliminate any pathogenic bacteria standard 4.7.38  soil association organic farming standards   on the other hand  as found in the university of minnesota study  the non-usage of artificial fertilizers  and resulting exclusive use of manure as fertilizer  by organic farmers can result in significantly greater accumulations of antibiotics in organic foods
