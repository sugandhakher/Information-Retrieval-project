overview  

sustainable management of fisheries cannot be achieved without an acceptance that the long-term goals of fisheries management are the same as those of environmental conservation

and   in critical condition  current
or

fishery ecosystems are an important subset of the wider marine environment  this article documents the views of
and
about innovative approaches towards sustainable fisheries 
history  

in the end  we will conserve only what we love  we will love only what we understand  and we will understand only what we are taught

senegalese conservationist  
in his 1883 inaugural address to the international fisheries exhibition in london 
asserted that overfishing or  permanent exhaustion  was scientifically impossible  and stated that probably  all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible   in reality  by 1883 marine fisheries were already collapsing  the
was established 12 years earlier for the purpose of finding why fisheries in
were declining  at the time of huxley s address  the atlantic
fishery had already collapsed  and has never recovered  
traditional management of fisheries  
traditionally 
and the science underpinning it was distorted by its  narrow focus on
and the corresponding failure to account for ecosystem effects leading to declines of species abundance and diversity  and by perceiving the fishing industry as  the sole legitimate user  in effect the owner  of marine living resources   historically  stock assessment scientists usually worked in government laboratories and considered their work to be providing services to the fishing industry  these scientists dismissed conservation issues and distanced themselves from the scientists and the science that raised the issues  this happened even as commercial fish stocks deteriorated  and even though many governments were signatories to binding conservation agreements 
defining sustainability  
the notion of
is sometimes regarded as an unattainable  even illogical notion because development inevitably depletes and degrades the environment 
  of the   distinguishes three ways of defining a sustainable fishery 
long term constant yield is the idea that undisturbed nature establishes a steady state that changes little over time  properly done  fishing at up to
allows nature to adjust to a new steady state  without compromising future harvests  however  this view is naive  because constancy is not an attribute of marine ecosystems  which dooms this approach  stock abundance fluctuates naturally  changing the potential yield over short and long term periods 
preserving intergenerational equity acknowledges natural fluctuations and regards as unsustainable only practices which damage the
structure   or deplete
to the point where rebuilding requires more than a single generation  providing rebuilding takes only one generation 
may be economically foolish  but it is not unsustainable  this definition is widely accepted 
maintaining a biological  social and economic system considers the health of the human ecosystem as well as the marine ecosystem  a fishery which rotates among multiple species can deplete individual stocks and still be sustainable so long as the ecosystem retains its intrinsic integrity  such a definition might consider as sustainable fishing practices that lead to the reduction and possible extinction of some species 
social sustainability  
fisheries and aquaculture are  directly or indirectly  a source of livelihood for over 500 million people  mostly in developing countries 
social sustainability can conflict with biodiversity  a fishery is socially sustainable if the fishery ecosystem maintains the ability to deliver products the society can use  major species shifts within the ecosystem could be acceptable as long as the flow of such products continues  humans have been operating such regimes for thousands of years  transforming many ecosystems  depleting or driving to extinction many species 

to a great extent  sustainability is like good art  it is hard to describe but we know it when we see it 

 
according to hilborn  the  loss of some species  and indeed transformation of the ecosystem is not incompatible with sustainable harvests   for example  in recent years 
have been caught as
in the western atlantic  their numbers have severely declined and they will probably go extinct if these catch rates continue  even if the barndoor skate goes extinct  changing the ecosystem  there could still be sustainable fishing of other commercial species 
reconciling fisheries with conservation  
management goals might consider the
on bear and river ecosystems
at the fourth world fisheries congress in 2004 
asked   how can fisheries science and conservation biology achieve a reconciliation    then answered his own question   by accepting each others essentials  that fishing should remain a viable occupation  and that aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity are allowed to persist  
a relatively new concept is relationship farming  this is a way of operating farms so they restore the
in their area  re-establishing a healthy food chain can result in the farm automatically filtering out impurities from feed water and air  feeding its own food chain  and additionally producing high net yields for harvesting  an example is the large cattle ranch
in southern spain  relationship farming was first made popular by
who created a 220 hectare relationship farm featured prominently in
book
 2006  and the documentary films 
and   the basic concept of relationship farming is to put effort into building a healthy food chain  and then the food chain does the hard work

large areas of the global continental shelf  highlighted in cyan  have had heavy bottom trawls repeatedly dragged over them
overfishing  
main article 
overfishing can be sustainable  according to hilborn  overfishing can be  a misallocation of societies  resources   but it does not necessarily threaten conservation or sustainability  
is traditionally defined as harvesting so many fish that the yield is less than it would be if fishing were reduced  for example 
are usually managed by trying to determine how many spawning salmon  called the     are needed each generation to produce the maximum harvestable surplus  the optimum escapement is that needed to reach that surplus  if the escapement is half the optimum  then normal fishing looks like overfishing  but this is still sustainable fishing  which could continue indefinitely at its reduced stock numbers and yield  there is a wide range of escapement sizes that present no threat that the stock might collapse or that the stock structure might erode 
on the other hand  overfishing can precede severe stock depletion and fishery collapse  hilborn points out that continuing to exert fishing pressure while production decreases  stock collapses and the fishery fails  is largely  the product of institutional failure  
today over 70  of fish species are either fully exploited  overexploited  depleted  or recovering from depletion  if overfishing does not decrease  it is predicted that stocks of all species currently commercially fished for will collapse by 2048 
a hubbert linearization    has been applied to the
industry  as well as charting the price of   which depends on
stocks  another example is
  comparing fisheries and mineral extraction tells us that human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a hubbert depletion cycle

ocean pollution  
main article 
a recent survey of global ocean health concluded that all parts of the ocean have been impacted by human development and that 41 percent has been fouled with human polluted runoff    and other abuses 
is not easy to fix  because pollution sources are so dispersed  and are built into the economic systems we depend on

fisheries management  
main article 
draws on
to enable sustainable exploitation  modern fisheries management is often defined as mandatory rules based on concrete objectives and a mix of management techniques  enforced by a
system 
ideas and rules  economist
believes sustainable growth is possible providing the right ideas  technology  are combined with the right rules  rather than simply hectoring fishers  there has been no lack of innovative ideas about how to harvest fish  he characterizes failures as primarily failures to apply appropriate rules 
fishing subsidies  government subsidies influence many of the world fisheries  operating cost subsidies allow european and asian
to fish in distant waters  such as west africa  many experts reject fishing subsidies and advocate restructuring incentives globally to help struggling fisheries recover 
economics  another focus of conservationists is on curtailing detrimental human activities by improving fisheries  market structure with techniques such as salable   like those set up by the   or laws such as those listed below 
  environmental economist  essam y mohammed  argues that by creating direct economic incentives  whereby people are able to receive payment for the services their property provides  will help to establish sustainable fisheries around the world as well as inspire conservation where it otherwise would not 
sustainable fisheries certification  a promising direction is the independent certification programs for sustainable fisheries conducted by organizations such as the
and   these programs work at raising consumer awareness and insight into the nature of their seafood purchases 
ecosystem based fisheries  see next section
ecosystem based fisheries  

we propose that rebuilding ecosystems  and not sustainability per se  should be the goal of fishery management  sustainability is a deceptive goal because human harvesting of fish leads to a progressive simplification of ecosystems in favour of smaller  high turnover  lower trophic level fish species that are adapted to withstand disturbance and habitat degradation 

 and  
according to
chris frid  the
points to
and
as the causes of recent  unprecedented declines in fish populations  frid counters that
has also altered the way the
works   everybody would like to see the rebuilding of fish stocks and this can only be achieved if we understand all of the influences  human and natural  on fish dynamics  he adds  fish communities can be altered in a number of ways  for example they can decrease if particular-sized individuals of a species are targeted  as this affects   fishing  however  is not the sole cause of changes to marine life is another example    no one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor  
the traditional approach to fisheries science and management has been to focus on a single species  this can be contrasted with the   ecosystem-based fishery concepts have been implemented in some regions  in a 2007 effort to  stimulate much needed discussion  and  clarify the essential components  of ecosystem-based fisheries science  a group of scientists offered the following ten commandments for ecosystem-based fisheries scientists

keep a perspective that is holistic  risk-adverse and adaptive 
maintain an old growth structure in fish populations  since big  old and fat female fish have been shown to be the best spawners  but are also susceptible to overfishing 
characterize and maintain the natural spatial structure of fish stocks  so that management boundaries match natural boundaries in the sea 
monitor and maintain seafloor habitats to make sure fish have food and shelter 
maintain resilient ecosystems that are able to withstand occasional shocks 
identify and maintain critical food-web connections  including predators and forage species 
adapt to ecosystem changes through time  both short-term and on longer cycles of decades or centuries  including global climate change 
account for evolutionary changes caused by fishing  which tends to remove large  older fish 
include the actions of humans and their social and economic systems in all ecological equations 

marine protected areas  
main article 
strategies and techniques for marine conservation tend to combine theoretical disciplines  such as population biology  with practical conservation strategies  such as setting up protected areas  as with
 mpas  or   each nation defines mpas independently  but they commonly involve increased protection for the area from fishing and other threats 
marine life is not evenly distributed in the oceans  most of the really valuable ecosystems are in relatively shallow coastal waters  above or near the   where the sunlit waters are often nutrient rich from
or
at the continental edge  allowing photosynthesis  which energizes the lowest trophic levels  in the 1970s  for reasons more to do with
than with fishing  the u s  extended its jurisdiction  then 12 miles from the coast  to 200 miles  this made huge shelf areas part of its territory  other nations followed  extending national control to what became known as the
 eez   this move has had many implications for fisheries conservation  since it means that most of the most productive maritime ecosystems are now under national jurisdictions  opening possibilities for protecting these ecosystems by passing appropriate laws 
characterises marine protected areas as  a conservation tool of revolutionary importance that is being incorporated into the fisheries mainstream  
have funded various initiatives aimed at encouraging the development of mpas and other ocean conservation measures

some organizations certify fishing industry players for sustainable or good practices  such as the
and  
other organizations offer advice to members of the public who eat with an eye to sustainability  according to the marine conservation biologist   four criteria apply when choosing seafood 
is the species in trouble in the wild where the animals were caught 
does fishing for the species damage ocean habitats 
is there a large amount of
taken with the target species 
does the fishery have a problem with discardsgenerally  undersized animals caught and thrown away because their market value is low

data issues  
data quality  
one of the major impediments to the rational control of marine resources is inadequate data  according to fisheries scientist milo adkison  2007   the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is poor data  fisheries management decisions are often based on population models  but the models need quality data to be accurate  scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data 
unreported fishing  
estimates of illegal catch losses range between  10 billion and  23 billion annually  representing between 11 and 26 million  
shifting baselines  
is a term which describes the way significant changes to a system are measured against previous baselines  which themselves may represent significant changes from the original state of the system  the term was first used by the
in his paper  anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries   pauly developed the term in reference to
where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct    population size  e g  how abundant a fish species population was before human exploitation  and thus work with a shifted baseline  he describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline  rather than the fishery in its untouched state  areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago  may have experienced long term decline  but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations  in this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were  and are  masked  there is a loss of
