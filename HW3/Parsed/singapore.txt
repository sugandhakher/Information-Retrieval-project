nearly 10  of singapore s land has been set aside for parks and   the network of nature reserves  parks    nature ways  tree-lined roads and other natural areas have enhanced the sense of green space in the city  this is a result of five decades of greening efforts  which began in 1963  when prime minister lee kuan yew launched singapore s first tree-planting campaign by planting a mempat tree     the aim was to soften the harshness of urbanisation and improve the quality of life  this initiative continued into the 1970s and 1980s under the parks and recreation department  prd   renamed the
