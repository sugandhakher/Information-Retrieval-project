etymology  
see also 
the name sustainability is derived from the
sustinere  tenere  to hold  sub  up   sustain can mean maintain    support   or  endure  since the 1980s sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept   that of the
of the
on march 20  1987  sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs 
components  
three pillars of sustainability  
a

and
are constrained by environmental limits
of sustainable development 
at the confluence of three constituent parts
the
identified sustainable development goals  such as economic development  social development and environmental protection  this view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing  in fact  the three pillars are interdependent  and in the long run none can exist without the others  the three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous
systems in recent years  in particular in the food industry  standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include  
and   some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability  or a quadruple bottom line  one such pillar is future generations  which emphasizes the long-term thinking associated with sustainability  there is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability 
sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment  the question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment 
a study from 2005 pointed out that
is as important as is sustainable development  ecological economist
asked   what use is a sawmill without a forest   from this perspective  the economy is a subsystem of human society  which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere  and a gain in one sector is a loss from another  this perspective led to the nested circles figure of  economics  inside  society  inside the  environment  
the simple definition that sustainability is something that improves  the
while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems   though vague  conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits  but sustainability is also a call to action  a task in progress or journey and therefore a political process  so some definitions set out common goals and values  the
speaks of a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature  universal human rights  economic justice  and a culture of peace  this suggested a more complex figure of sustainability  which included the importance of the domain of  politics  
more than that  sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience  economic prosperity  political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future  specific types of sustainability include   
or   understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like  liberty  or  justice   it has also been described as a  dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development

and environmental protection it continued using three domains  economics  environment and social sustainability  more recently  using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade  the
approach distinguished four domains of economic  ecological  political and cultural sustainability  this in accord with the
  which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development  the model is now being used by organizations such as the
cities programme  and metropolis
shaping the future  
integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities  a telling example is the   it aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable  research and innovation in europe are financially supported by the programme   which is also open to participation worldwide  encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations 
resiliency  
in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability  resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to
a definition remains elusive  resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the services current and future generations need from them  it is also concerned with commitment from
policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life  the resiliency of an ecosystem  and thereby  its sustainability  can be reasonably measured at
or events where the combination of
occurring
forces    water  soil    vegetation  and   interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances 
a practical view of sustainability is
that maintain processes of
indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems  in this way  sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced  in nature  the accounting occurs naturally through a process of
as an ecosystem returns to
from an external disturbance  the adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event  earthquake  volcanic eruption  hurricane  tornado  flood  or thunderstorm   followed by     or
of the
or energies that the external forces created 
in analysing systems such as urban and national parks  dams  farms and gardens  theme parks  open-pit mines  water catchments  one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events 
history  
main article 
the history of sustainability traces human-dominated
systems from the earliest
to the present time  this history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular   followed by crises that were either resolved  producing sustainability  or not  leading to decline 
in early human history  the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities  between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago 
emerged which depended largely on their
and the creation of a  structure of permanence  
the western
of the 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in  
was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity  modern
systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease  in the mid-20th century  a gathering
pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed  in the late 20th century  environmental problems became global in scale  the 1973 and 1979
demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources 
in the 21st century  there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human   produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels 
principles and concepts  
the philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields  in recent years an area that has come to be called
has emerged 
the
identified principles and treaties on sustainable development  including economic development 
and environmental protection  the
approach distinguishes the four domains of economic  ecological  political and cultural sustainability  this in accord with the
  which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development 
scale and context  
sustainability is studied and managed over many scales  levels or frames of reference  of time and space and in many contexts of environmental  social and economic organization  the focus ranges from the total
 sustainability  of planet earth to the sustainability of economic sectors  ecosystems  countries  municipalities  neighbourhoods  home gardens  individual lives  individual goods and services    occupations  lifestyles  behaviour patterns and so on  in short  it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it  as daniel botkin  author and environmentalist  has stated   we see a landscape that is always in flux  changing over many scales of time and space  
the sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability  to shed light on the big picture  explorer and sustainability campaigner
has drawn parallels to other  more tangible   for example  he likens human existence on earth isolated as the planet is in space  whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent
of resources to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water  in both cases  he argues  exercising the
is a key factor in survival 
consumption  
a major driver of human impact on earth systems is the destruction of
  and especially  the earth s ecosystems  the environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person  which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used  whether or not those resources are renewable  and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved  careful resource management can be applied at many scales  from economic sectors like agriculture  manufacturing and industry  to work organizations  the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services 
one of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the
formula  this formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components 
numbers  levels of consumption  which it terms  affluence   although the usage is different   and impact per unit of resource use  which is termed  technology   because this impact depends on the
used   the equation is expressed 
i   p  a  t
where  i   environmental impact  p   population  a   affluence  t   technology
measurement  
main article 
sustainability measurement is a term that denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability  the metrics used for the measurement of sustainability  involving the sustainability of environmental  social and economic domains  both individually and in various combinations  are evolving  they include   benchmarks  audits 
systems like
and   indexes and accounting  as well as assessment  appraisal and other reporting systems  they are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales 
some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate     world sustainability society    and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the

population

is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion  and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries  which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050  long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people  and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100 
emerging economies like those of china and india aspire to the living standards of the western world as does the non-industrialized world in general  it is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability

on one account  sustainability  concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption  wealth  utility  or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons   sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity  sustainability economics represents      a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective  social  cultural  health-related and monetary financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis   however  the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare  resources  or profit margins  at present  the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption western lifestyles  the developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable  the challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact  this must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between  on the one hand  economic growth and on the other 
and resource depletion 
a recent unep report proposes a
defined as one that improves human well-being and social equity  while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities  it  does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of    the report makes three key findings  that greening not only generates increases in wealth  in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital  but also  over a period of six years  produces a higher rate of gdp growth  that there is an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons  arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor   in the transition to a green economy  new jobs are created  which in time exceed the losses in brown economy jobs  however  there is a period of job losses in transition  which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce 
several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform  the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth  the consequences of nature being treated as an economic   and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior

historically there has been a close correlation between
and   as communities grow  so the environment declines  this trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers  economic growth  and environmental indicators  unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer because it eats away at the earth s
which are its life-support system  there is concern that  unless resource use is checked  modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through
of their resource base  while conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources  ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale  rather than continual growth  
and efficient allocation  in that order  the
states that  business cannot succeed in societies that fail  
in
and
fields  the term
is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality  when used in this way  it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure  ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism  the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to   an economy that is able to sustain gdp growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled  exactly how  if  or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate  in 2011 the   hosted by the
 unep   warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals  ores  fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current rate of consumption unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling  the report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum  ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries   by comparison  the average person in india today consumes four tons per year  sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce
 the amount of resource  e g  water  energy  or materials  needed for the production  consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service  whether this be achieved from improved economic management  product design  or new technology 
there are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation  on the one hand  it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity  i e   energy and materials use per unit   could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold  thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution  on the other hand  an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth  in large part because of the
or
resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution  furthermore  there are inherent thermodynamic  i e     and practical limits to all efficiency improvements  for example  there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food  and there are limits to making automobiles  houses  furniture  and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions  since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely  it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution  i e   economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run  consequently  long-term sustainability requires the transition to a
in which total gdp remains more or less constant  as has been advocated for decades by
and others in the
community 
a different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach  this approach views  restore  as a fourth component to the common reduce  reuse  recycle motto  participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources  these financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects  but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects

the economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression
to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free  in general  as a
or service becomes more scarce the
increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality  technical innovation and alternative products  however  this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system  as ecosystem services are generally treated as economic
they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded  a situation sometimes referred to as the  
one approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to  internalize  these  externalities  by using market strategies like
and incentives  tradeable permits for carbon  and the encouragement of  
associated with
 lets   a
and
have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment 
is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment  the global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world s carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years 
economic opportunity  
treating the environment as an externality may generate short-term profit at the expense of sustainability 
practices  on the other hand  integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones  i e   the    growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed    as it leads to a decline in   minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses  for example  industrial waste can be treated as an  economic resource in the wrong place   the benefits of
include savings from disposal costs  fewer environmental penalties  and reduced liability insurance  this may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image  energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs 
the idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the sustainability consortium of the   the sustainable business institute  and the world council for sustainable development  the expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to
through the introduction of
workers  research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability  and led to emergence of the concept of  embedded sustainability   defined by its authors chris laszlo and
as  incorporation of environmental  health  and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality in other words  with no social or green premium   laszlo and zhexembayeva s research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation  a  better risk-management  b  increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use  c  better product differentiation  d  new market entrances  e  enhanced brand and reputation  f  greater opportunity to influence industry standards  and g  greater opportunity for radical innovation   s 2014 research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services  as well as the company strategy as a whole  when right principles of innovation are applied 
ecosocialist approach

and
one school of thought  often labeled
or ecological marxism  asserts that the
is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability  this theory rests on the premises that 
capitalisms sole economic purpose is unlimited  in the hands of the
the urge to accumulate  the   drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production  creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth
capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production  the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends 
thus  according to this analysis 
giving economic priority to the fulfillment of
while staying within ecological limits  as
demands  is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism
a steady-state capitalist economy is impossible  further  a steady-state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive
capitalism will  unless overcome by   run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and
by this logic  market-based solutions to ecological crises        are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalisms structural failures  low-risk technology science-based solutions such as     and increases in
are seen as necessary but insufficient  high-risk technological solutions such as
and
are entirely rejected  attempts made by businesses to  their practices are regarded as false advertising  and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology  such as s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power  has   viz  further economic growth 
models and the
are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the
to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable unsustainable  ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerateand capitalist governments to implementconstraints on maximum profit  such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures  renders
incapable of facilitating large-scale change  history teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements       at a certain point  at which the systems underlying accumulation drive is affected  its resistance to environmental demands stiffens  they also note that  up until the event of total   destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation  thus  capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters  i e  convert to sustainable ecological production  
ecosocialists advocate for the
succession of capitalism by ecosocialisman
economic political social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis  and hence the only path towards sustainability  sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists  environmental activists  and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in   what every environmentalist needs to know       is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem  and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis  it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom  through social struggle  in order to create a whole new worldin coevolution with the planet

a major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty  it has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation  such acknowledgment has been made by the
and the millennium development goals  there is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues  according to the brundtland report  poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems  it is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality  individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs  such as nutrition and medicine  and general well-being  as population growth continues to increase  increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials  according to the un population fund  high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated  and the worlds poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates  the word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment  for example  teaching
to the poor by boiling their water with   would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy  whereas using
would be  also  sustainable
can involve the
of materials  such as the use of
for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country s timber base  another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries  such as  s use of wire rope from shipping container
to act as the structural wire rope for
that cross rivers in poor rural areas in asia and africa 
human relationship to nature

to
the
in this excerpt    
the greatest example of
we have ever seen 
is a movement founded by
that establishes principles for the well-being of all life on earth and the richness and diversity of life forms  the movement advocates  among other things  a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world  to achieve this  deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic  technological  and ideological structures that will improve the
rather than the   those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen  the concept of a billion-year
has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species  for example through   allowing  
human settlements  
1  reduce dependence upon fossil fuels 
underground metals  and minerals
2  reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals
and other unnatural substances
3  reduce encroachment upon nature
4  meet human needs fairly   efficiently
one approach to   exemplified by small-scale urban
and rural   seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of   which maximize
particularly in food production  these principles  on a broader scale  underpin the concept of a
economy  these approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of  
other approaches  loosely based around   are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve
which support   residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles  and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures  compared with those living in
suburbs  in
the recent movement of
promotes a sustainable approach towards construction  that appreciates and develops  
and   this in contrast to
and
architecture  as well as opposing solitary
and   both trends started in the 1980s  the concept of
has also been introduced in europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl 
large scale
can influence both community choices and the built environment 
may be one such movement  eco-municipalities take a
approach  based on sustainability principles  the eco-municipality movement is participatory  involving community members in a bottom-up approach  in sweden  more than 70 cities and towns25 per cent of all municipalities in the countryhave adopted a common set of
and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations  there are now twelve eco-municipalities in the united states and the
has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles 
there is a wealth of advice available to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social impact on the environment through small  inexpensive and easily achievable steps  but the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes  at all levels and contexts of society  the
has recognised the central role of education  and have declared a   20052014  which aims to  challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future   the
proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic
head-on and strengthen people s connections with the natural world 
human and labor rights  
application of
requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights  prevention of human trafficking  and other human rights risks  these issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities  the international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability  and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services  the
 financial industry  
 garments   and
are examples of such organizations and initiatives  resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level  such as
for cleaning products  -140 for carpet production  and even labeling of
