 aec  was created to control the future of the project 
in 1974  the aec gave way to the   which was tasked with regulating the nuclear power industry  and the   which was tasked to manage the nuclear weapon  naval reactor  and energy development programs 
the   called attention to the need to consolidate energy policy  on august 4  1977 
signed into law the department of energy organization act of 1977    91  enacted august4  1977   which created the department of energy  the new agency  which began operations on october 1  1977  consolidated the   the   the   and programs of various other agencies  former secretary of defense   who served under presidents nixon and ford during the   was appointed as the first secretary 
weapon plans stolen  
main article 
in december 1999  the fbi was investigating how china obtained plans for a specific nuclear device 
was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from
for the   federal officials  including then-energy secretary   publicly named lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime  the u  s  congress held hearings to investigate the department of energy s mishandling of his case  republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of
and security issues  not the department of energy  all but one of the 59 charges against lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the chinese obtained could not have come from lee  lee filed suit and won a  1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies

unveiled on may 7  2009  a  26.4 billion budget request for doe for fiscal year  fy  2010  including  2.3 billion for the doe
 eere   the budget aims to substantially expand the use of
sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure  it also makes significant investments in
and   in
technologies  and in scientific research and innovation 
as part of the  789 billion economic stimulus package in the
of 2009  congress provided energy with an additional  38.3 billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010  adding about 75 percent to energy s annual budgets  most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contracts

energy savings performance contract  
main article 
energy savings performance contracts  espcs  are contracts under which a contractor designs  constructs  and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project  and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agency s utility bills  the contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings  and after the contract ends  all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency 
loan guarantee program  
main article 
title xvii of
authorizes the doe to issue loan guarantees to eligible projects that  avoid  reduce  or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of   and  employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the united states at the time the guarantee is issued  
in loan guarantees  a conditional commitment requires to meet an equity commitment  as well as other conditions  before the loan guarantee is completed 
energy innovation hubs  
energy innovation hubs are
meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies  the consortium for advanced simulation of light water reactors  casl  was the first doe energy innovation hub established in july 2010  for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation  m s  solutions for commercial nuclear reactors 
the doe budget includes  280 million to fund eight energy innovation hubs  each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge  two of the eight hubs are included in the
budget and will focus on integrating smart materials  designs  and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity  another two hubs  included in the doe office of science budget  will tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes  yet another hub will develop  smart  materials that will allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions 
in 2012  the doe awarded  120 million to the
to start a new eih  the critical materials institute  which will focus on improving the supply of   which is controlled by china

symbolism in the seal  
excerpt from the code of federal regulations  title 10  energy
the official seal of the department of energy  includes a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt  on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic         and   it is crested by the white head of an   atop a white rope  both appear on a blue field surrounded by
circles in which the name of the agency  in gold  appears on a green background  
 the
represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the nation s increasing demands for   the         and
serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands  the rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities  the
bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the nation s challenge in harnessing the forces  
 the color scheme is derived from nature  symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of man s existence  the blue field represents
and   green represents
resources and the
itself  and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces  by invoking this   the color scheme represents the nation s commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the
