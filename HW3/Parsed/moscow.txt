etymology  
the name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the   there have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river  the most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the proto-balto-slavic root  mzg- muzg- from the proto-indo-european  meu-  wet   so the name moskva might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh  its
include     muzga  pool  puddle     mazgoti and   mazgt  to wash     majjati  to drown     merg  to dip  immerse   there exist as well similar place names in poland like  
the original old russian form of the name is reconstructed as     mosky  hence it was one of a few slavic   as with other nouns of that declension  it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language  as a result the first written mentions in the 12th century were   moskov       moskvi     e   moskve moskv     from the latter forms came the modern russian name   moskva  which is a result of
with the numerous slavic  
however  the form moskov has left some traces in many other languages  such as english  moscow    moskau    moscou    maskava    moskov      mskw      mskew      muskav  etc  in a similar manner the latin name moscovia has been formed  later it became a colloquial name for russia used in western europe in the 16th17th centuries  from it as well came english muscovy 
various other theories  of celtic  iranian  caucasic  finno-ugrian origin   having little or no scientific ground  are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists 
there has been as well a nave scholastic etymology that connected the name of   a son of   with the name of the city  so that it was thought that the biblical figure was a forefather of russians as well as other slavs  the surface similarity of the name russia with rosh  an obscure biblical tribe or country  which is mentioned alongside with mosoch in ezekiel  38 23  39 1   strengthened up such etymologies

architecture  
in moscow  the masterpiece of
moscow s architecture is world-renowned  moscow is the site of   with its elegant   as well as the
and the   the first kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century 
medieval moscow s design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares  this layout  as well as moscow s rivers  helped shape moscow s design in subsequent centuries 
the kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century  its towers and some of its churches were built by italian architects  lending the city some of the aura of the renaissance  from the end of the 15th century  the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries  palaces  walls  towers  and churches 
the city s appearance had not changed much by the 18th century  houses were made of pine and spruce logs  with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark  the rebuilding of moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires  but also the needs of the nobility  much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style 
for much of its architectural history  moscow was dominated by orthodox churches  however  the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during soviet times  especially as a result of  s large-scale effort to  modernize  moscow  stalin s plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways  some of them over ten lanes wide  which  while greatly simplifying movement through the city  were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts  among the many casualties of stalin s demolitions was the   a longtime city landmark  as well as mansions and commercial buildings the city s newfound status as the capital of a deeply
nation  made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition  many of the city s churches  which in most cases were some of moscow s oldest and most prominent buildings  were destroyed  some notable examples include the
and the cathedral of christ the savior  during the 1990s  both were rebuilt  many smaller churches  however  were lost 
while the later stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation  the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city  especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with   responsible for such landmarks as lenin s mausoleum  another prominent architect was   famous for shukhov tower  just one of many
designed by shukhov  it was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a russian broadcasting company  shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the
architecture of early soviet russia  he designed spacious elongated shop galleries  most notably the
department store on   bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults 
  the tallest freestanding structure in
and
perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the stalinist period are the so-called   comprising seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the kremlin  a defining feature of moscows skyline  their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the
in   and their stylewith intricate exteriors and a large central spirehas been described as   all seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city  they are among the tallest constructions in central moscow apart from the   which  when it was completed in 1967  was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the worlds seventy-second tallest  ranking among buildings such as the
in dubai 
in taiwan and the
in toronto 
the soviet goal of providing housing for every family  and the rapid growth of moscow s population  led to the construction of large  monotonous housing blocks  most of these date from the post-stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power  brezhnev  khrushchev  etc    they are usually badly maintained 
although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s  more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall  and have   it is estimated that moscow has over twice as many elevators as new york city and four times as many as   moslift  one of the city s major elevator operating companies  has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call  to release residents trapped in elevators 
  mostly found in the central part of the city  are massive and usually ornamented with
motifs that imitate
themes  however  small churches  almost always  found across the city provide glimpses of its past  the old   a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area  preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century  many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city  behind the stalinist
of   for example  are also examples of
architecture typical of tsarist times     
and other large estates just outside moscow originally belong to nobles from the tsarist era  and some   both inside and outside the city  are open to muscovites and tourists 
  painting by   1801
attempts are being made to restore many of the citys best-kept examples of pre-soviet architecture  these restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless faades  there are a few examples of notable  early soviet
work too  such as the house of the architect
in the arbat area  many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity 
is also widely practiced  later examples of interesting soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi- styles employed  such as with the
project  familiarly known as  false teeth of moscow  and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central moscow involved in the project 
plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there  frequently  the plaques are dedicated to soviet celebrities not well-known outside  or often  like with decorated generals and revolutionaries  now both inside  of russia  there are also many  museum houses  of famous russian writers  composers  and artists in the city 
moscow s skyline is quickly modernizing with several new towers under construction 
in recent years  the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings  as much as a third of historic moscow has been destroyed in the past few years to make space for luxury apartments and hotels  other historical buildings  including such landmarks as the 1930 moskva hotel and the 1913 department store voyentorg  have been razed and reconstructed anew  with the inevitable loss of historical value  critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws  in the last 12 years more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down  several of those dating back to the 17th century  some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures  which include many works by architect konstantin melnikov and
metro station 
some organizations  such as moscow architecture preservation society and save europe s heritage  are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems
