the implementation of agenda21 was intended to involve action at international  national  regional and local levels  some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally  as recommended in chapter28 of the document  these programs are often known as  local agenda 21  or  la21   for example  in the   the plan is  philippines agenda21   pa21   the group  iclei-local governments for sustainability  formed in 1990  today its members come from over 1,000cities  towns  and counties in 88countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of agenda21 implementation 
in other countries    opposition to agenda 21 s ideas has surfaced to varied extents  in some cases  opposition has been legislated into several states limiting or forbidding the participation and or funding of local government activities that support agenda 21 
europe turned out to be the continent where la21 was best accepted and most implemented  in sweden  for example  all local governments have implemented a local agenda 21 initiative

in africa  national support for agenda21 is strong and most countries are signatories  but support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country  for example  in 2002   who was then president of   spoke about the importance of adhering to agenda21 at the 2002 earth summit  noting that as a
country  namibia sets a lot of store in the
 unccd   furthermore  there is little mention of agenda21 at the local level in indigenous media  only major municipalities in
countries are members of iclei  agenda21 participation in
countries mirrors that of
countries  with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level  countries in sub-saharan africa and north africa generally have poorly documented agenda21 status reports    by contrast   s participation in agenda21 mirrors that of modern europe  with 21city members of iclei and support of agenda21 by national-level government
