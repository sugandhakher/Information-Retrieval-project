such as metals  minerals and   and   which is important to protect the natural world  those who follow the conservation ethic and  especially  those who advocate or work toward conservation goals are termed  
the terms conservation and preservation are frequently conflated outside of the academic  scientific  and professional literatures  the us national park service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics 
conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing  both terms involve a degree of protection  but how that is protection is carried out is the key difference  conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources  while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings  objects  and landscapes  put simply  conservation seeks the proper use of nature  while preservation seeks protection of nature from use 
during the environmental movement of the early 20th century  two opposing factions emerged  conservationists and preservationists  conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether

is another commonly stated goal of conservation  ensuring that  some will be available for future generations  to continue a way of life 
the consumer conservation ethic is sometimes expressed by the four r s    rethink  reduce  recycle  repair  this social ethic primarily relates to     the   and efficient use of   the moderation of destructive use of finite resources  and the prevention of harm to common resources such as

quality  the natural functions of a living earth  and cultural values in a  
the principal value underlying most expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value  a view carried forward by the scientific
and some of the older
schools of

schools of conservation seek a proper valuation of
upon nature in their effect upon human   now and to posterity  how such values are assessed and exchanged among people determines the social  political  and personal restraints and imperatives by which conservation is practiced  this is a view common in the modern  
these movements have diverged but they have deep and common roots in the  
in the   the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid the foundation for romantic and utilitarian conservation traditions in america  the posthumous publication of  s
established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as a citadel to nourish the spirit of man  from
a very different book    later subtitled  the earth as modified by human action   catalogued his observations of man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives 
terminology  
the conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem  unless we solve that problem  it will avail us little to solve all others 
in common usage  the term refers to the activity of systematically protecting natural resources such as forests  including biological diversity  carl f  jordan defines the term as 
biological conservation as being a philosophy of managing the environment in a manner that does not despoil  exhaust or extinguish 
while this usage is not new  the idea of biological conservation has been applied to the principles of      
and
to maintain   
the term  conservation  itself may cover the concepts such as

 preservation of seeds   these are often summarized as the priority to   especially by

distinct trends exist regarding conservation development  while many countries  efforts to preserve
and their
have been government-led  those in the north western europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in   expressed at the level of the individual and the national  regional or local   thus countries like britain  the netherlands  germany  etc  had what we would today term
 in the shape of the  
and county naturalists  trusts  dating back to 1889  1895 and 1912 respectively  natuurmonumenten  provincial conservation trusts for each dutch province  vogelbescherming  etc   a long time before there were
and   this in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated europe  as well as a longstanding interest in
government in some countries  like the uk  leaving it as no coincidence that   the scottish-born founder of the national park movement  and hence of government-sponsored conservation  did his sterling work in the usa  where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such nps as
and   nowadays  officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other  and in practice private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status 
protected areas in developing countries  where probably as many as 7080 percent of the species of the world live  still enjoy very little effective management and protection  some countries  such as mexico  have non-profit civil organizations and land owners dedicated to protect vast private property  such is the case of hacienda chichen s maya jungle reserve and bird refuge in     the adopt a ranger foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries  there are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment  but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50  short this means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries 
one of the world s foremost conservationists  dr  kenton miller  stated about the importance of rangers   the future of our ecosystem services and our heritage depends upon park rangers  with the rapidity at which the challenges to protected areas are both changing and increasing  there has never been more of a need for well prepared human capacity to manage  park rangers are the backbone of park management  they are on the ground  they work on the front line with scientists  visitors  and members of local communities  
adopt a ranger  fears that the ranger deficit is the greatest single limiting factor in effectively conserving nature in 75  of the world  currently  no conservation organization or western country or international organization addresses this problem  adopt a ranger has been incorporated to draw worldwide public attention to the most urgent problem that conservation is facing in developing and transition countries  protected areas without field staff  very specifically  it will contribute to solving the problem by fund raising to finance rangers in the field  it will also help governments in developing and transition countries to assess realistic staffing needs and staffing strategies 
others  including   have advocated instead for cooperation with local tribal peoples  who are natural allies of the conservation movement and can provide cost-effective protection
