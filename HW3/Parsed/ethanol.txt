etymology  
ethanol is the
defined by the
for a molecule with two carbon
 prefix  eth-    having a single bond between them  suffix  -ane    and an attached -oh group  suffix  -ol   
the prefix ethyl was coined in 1834 by the german chemist   ethyl is a contraction of the ancient greek   aithr  upper air  and the greek word   hyle  substance  
the name ethanol was coined as a result of a resolution that was adopted at the international conference on chemical nomenclature that was held in april 1892 in geneva  switzerland 
the term    now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature  but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol  ultimately a medieval loan from arabic   use of alcohol in this sense is modern  introduced in the mid 18th century  before that time  middle latin alcohol referred to  powdered ore of antimony  powdered cosmetic   by the later 17th century  any sublimated substance    use for  the spirit of wine   shortened from a full expression alcohol of wine  recorded 1753  the systematic use in chemistry dates to 1850

gastrointestinal diseases  
diagram of mucosal layer
alcohol stimulates gastric juice production  even when food is not present  and as a result  its consumption will stimulate acidic secretions normally intended to digest protein molecules  consequently  the excess acidity may harm the inner lining of the stomach  the stomach lining is normally protected by a mucosal layer which prevents the stomach from essentially digesting itself  however  in patients who have a
disease  pud   this mucosal layer is broken down  pud is commonly associated with the bacteria h  pylori  h  pylori secrete a toxin that weakens the mucosal wall  which as a result lead to acid and protein enzymes penetrating the weakened barrier  because alcohol stimulates a person s stomach to secrete acid  a person with pud should avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach  drinking alcohol would cause more acid release which would further damage the already-weakened stomach wall  complications of this disease could include a burning pain in the abdomen  bloating and in severe cases  the presence of dark black stools indicate internal bleeding  a person who drinks alcohol regularly is strongly advised to reduce their intake to prevent pud aggravation 
ingestion of alcohol can initiate systemic pro-inflammatory changes through two intestinal routes   1  altering intestinal microbiota composition  dysbiosis   which increases lipopolysaccharide  lps  release  and  2  degrading intestinal barrier integrity - thus allowing this  lps  to enter the circulatory system  the major portion of the blood supply to the liver is provided the portal vein  therefore  while the liver is continuously fed nutrients from the intestine  it is also exposed to any bacteria and or bacterial derivatives that breach the intestinal mucosal barrier  consequently  lps levels increase in the portal vein  liver and systemic circulation after alcohol intake  immune cells in the liver respond to lps with the production of reactive oxygen species  ros   leukotrienes  chemokines and cytokines  these factors promote tissue inflammation and contribute to organ pathology

and other oxidizing enzymes such as
in the brain  although acetaldehyde has been associated with some of the adverse and toxic effects of ethanol  it appears to play a central role in the activation of the  
ethanol s rewarding and reinforcing  i e     properties are mediated through its effects on
neurons in the   which connects the

with chronic alcohol intake  consumption of ethanol similarly induces creb phosphorylation through the d1 receptor pathway  but it also alters
function through phosphorylation mechanisms  an adaptive
of the d1 receptor pathway and creb function occurs as well  chronic consumption is also associated with an effect on creb phosphorylation and function via postsynaptic nmda receptor signaling cascades through a
and -mediated pathway  these modifications to creb function in the mesolimbic pathway

alcohol and metronidazole  
one of the most important drug food interactions that should be noted is between alcohol and  
metronidazole is an antibacterial agent that kills bacteria by damaging cellular dna and hence cellular function  metronidazole is usually given to people who have diarrhea caused by
bacteria  c  difficile is one of the most common microorganisms that cause diarrhea and can lead to complications such as colon inflammation and even more severely  death 
patients who are taking metronidazole are strongly advised to avoid alcohol  even after 1hour after the last dose  the reason is that alcohol and metronidazole can lead to side effects such as flushing  headache  nausea  vomiting  abdominal cramps  and sweating  these symptoms are often called the -like reaction  the proposed mechanism of action for this interaction is that metronidazole can bind to an enzyme that normally metabolizes alcohol  binding to this enzyme may impair the liver s ability to process alcohol for proper excretion

some of its actions on   specifically the nach receptors and the glycine receptor  are   with potentiation or inhibition occurring dependent on ethanol concentration  this is because ethanol s effects on these channels are a summation of positive and negative allosteric modulatory actions 
pharmacokinetics  
the removal of ethanol from the human body  through oxidation by
in the   is limited  hence  the removal of a large concentration of alcohol from
may follow   this means that alcohol leaves the body at a constant rate  rather than having an elimination  
the rate-limiting steps for one substance may be in common with other substances  as a result  the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the rate of metabolism of
and   methanol itself is not highly toxic  but its metabolites
and
are  therefore  to reduce the rate of production and concentration of these harmful metabolites  ethanol can be ingested 
poisoning can be treated in the same way

and
ethanol within the human body is converted into
by
and then into the
in
by  
is the final product of both carbohydrate and fat metabolism  where the acetyl can be further used to produce energy or for biosynthesis  as such  ethanol can be compared to an energy-bearing macronutrient  yielding approximately 7 kcal per gram consumed  however  the product of the first step of this breakdown  acetaldehyde  is more toxic than ethanol  acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol  it has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and multiple forms of cancer 
during the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases  nad    is converted into reduced nad  normally  nad is used to metabolise fats in the liver  and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of nad  prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver  leading to the term  fatty liver   continued consumption  such as in   then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death  these cells are then replaced with scar tissue  leading to the condition called  
alcohol and digestion  
a part of ethyl alcohol is hydrophobic  this hydrophobic or lipophilic end can diffuse across cells that line the stomach wall  in fact  alcohol is one of the rare substances that can be absorbed in the stomach  most food substances are absorbed in the small intestine  however  even though alcohol can be absorbed in the stomach  it is mostly absorbed in the small intestine because the small intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption  once alcohol is absorbed in the small intestine  it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into the small intestine  thus  alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients  after absorption  alcohol reaches the liver where it is metabolized 
breathalyzers  
alcohol that is not processed by the liver goes to the heart  the liver can process only a certain amount of alcohol per unit time  thus  when a person drinks too much alcohol  more alcohol can reach the heart  in the heart  alcohol reduces the force of heart contractions  consequently  the heart will pump less blood  lowering overall body blood pressure  also  blood that reaches the heart goes to the lungs to replenish blood s oxygen concentration  it is at this stage that a person can breathe out traces of alcohol  this is the underlying principle of the alcohol breath testing  or breathalyzers  to determine if a driver has been drinking and driving 
from the lungs  blood returns to the heart and will be distributed throughout the body  interestingly  alcohol increases levels of high-density lipoproteins hdls   which carry cholesterol  alcohol is known to make blood less likely to clot  reducing risk of heart attack and stroke  this could be the reason that alcohol seems to produce health benefits when consumed in moderate amounts  also  alcohol dilates blood vessels  consequently  a person will feel warmer  and his her skin flush and appear pink 
magnitude of effects  
some individuals have less effective forms of one or both of the metabolizing enzymes  and can experience more severe symptoms from ethanol consumption than others  however  those having acquired
have a greater quantity of these enzymes  and metabolize ethanol more rapidly

physical properties  
ethanol burning with its spectrum depicted
ethanol is a volatile  colorless liquid that has a slight odor  it burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light 
the physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its
group and the shortness of its carbon chain  ethanol s hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding  rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight  such as  
ethanol is slightly more refractive than water  having a
of 1.36242  at  589.3nm and 18.35c or 65.03f

solvent properties  
ethanol is a versatile solvent 
with water and with many organic solvents  including                     and   it is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons  such as
and   and with aliphatic chlorides such as
and  
ethanol s miscibility with water contrasts with the immiscibility of longer-chain alcohols  five or more carbon atoms   whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases  the miscibility of ethanol with
is limited to alkanes up to   mixtures with
and higher alkanes show a
below a certain temperature  about 13c for dodecane   the miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases 
ethanol-water mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions  mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only 1.92 volumes of mixture  mixing ethanol and water is   with up to 777j mol being released at 298k 
mixtures of ethanol and water form an
at about 89 mole-  ethanol and 11 mole-  water or a mixture of 95.6 percent ethanol by mass  or about 97    at normal pressure  which boils at 351k  78c   this azeotropic composition is strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and vanishes at temperatures below 303k 
hydrogen bonding in solid ethanol at 186c
hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be
to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air  the polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds  notably
and           and  
and
are slightly soluble in ethanol  because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end  it will also dissolve nonpolar substances  including most
and numerous flavoring  coloring  and medicinal agents 
the addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the
of water  this property partially explains the    phenomenon  when wine is swirled in a glass  ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass  as the wine s ethanol content decreases  its surface tension increases and the thin film  beads up  and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet

fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol  this process is carried out at around 3540c  95104f   toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing  higher concentrations  therefore  are obtained by
or   the most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18  ethanol by volume 
to produce ethanol from starchy materials such as   the
must first be converted into sugars  in brewing   this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate  or   which produces the
  when the malted grain is   the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars 
cellulose  
main article 
sugars for
can be obtained from   deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products  such as     and   into renewable energy resources  other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and
such as
may also be a sources of fermentable sugars 
testing  
infrared reflection spectra of liquid ethanol  showing the -oh band centered at  3300cm1 and c-h bands at  2950cm1 
of liquid ethanol 
breweries and
plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration  infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the ch band at 2900cm1  this method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the ch band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content  the calculation makes use of the   alternatively  by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product  using a   the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content  this inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry 
purification  
distillation  
ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanolwater mixture  for most industrial and fuel uses  the ethanol must be purified 
at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6  by volume  89.5 mole    this mixture is an
with a boiling point of 78.1c  172.6f   and cannot be further purified by distillation  addition of an entraining agent  such as     or   allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol  water  and the entraining agent to be formed  this lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially  leading to water-free ethanol 
at pressures less than atmospheric pressure  the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures  and at pressures less than 70  9.333kpa   there is no azeotrope  and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture  while vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical  pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research  in this technique  a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6  ethanol  then  fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6  azeotrope  leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom

can be used to selectively absorb the water from the 95.6  ethanol solution  synthetic
in pellet form can be used  as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents  including     and   the zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot   cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated  but where ethanol is made from grain  they are often available at low cost  absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene  and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations 
membranes and reverse osmosis  
membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water  membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria  membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process  this process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step  the further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode  vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed 
other techniques

grades of ethanol  
denatured alcohol  
main article 
pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily
as psychoactive drugs  but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption  to relieve the tax burden on these uses  most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink  these include
such as
and toxins such as     and   products of this kind are called denatured alcohol 
absolute alcohol  
absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content  there are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1  to a few parts per million  ppm  levels  if
is used to remove water  it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent  e g  benzene   absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption  absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications  where water will react with other chemicals  and as fuel alcohol  spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in
and visible light  fit for use as a solvent in  
pure ethanol is classed as 200
in the u s   equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the uk system 
rectified spirits  
rectified spirit  an azeotropic composition of 96  ethanol containing 4  water  is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes  wine spirits are about 94  ethanol  188    the impurities are different from those in 95   190 proof  laboratory ethanol 
reactions  
for more details on this topic  see  
ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol  meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well  many ethanol reactions occur at its
group 
ester formation  
in the presence of acid catalysts  ethanol reacts with
to produce ethyl
and water 
  hoch2ch3 
  h2o
this reaction  which is conducted on large scale industrially  requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed  esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt  this reaction is known as
because it is used in the preparation of soap  ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids 
and
are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and
respectively

acid-base chemistry  
ethanol is a neutral molecule and the
of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00  ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its   the
ion  ch3ch2o   by reaction with an
such as  
2 ch3ch2oh   2 na  2 ch3ch2ona   h2
or a very strong base such as  
ch3ch2oh   nah  ch3ch2ona   h2
the acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same  as indicated by their
of 15.7 and 16 respectively  thus  sodium ethoxide and
exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced

oxidation  
ethanol can be oxidized to
and further oxidized to   depending on the reagents and conditions  this oxidation is of no importance industrially  but in the human body  these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the
  the oxidation product of ethanol  acetic acid  is a nutrient for humans  being a precursor to   where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis 
history  
for more details on this topic  see  
the
of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest
employed by humans  the intoxicating effects of ethanol consumption have been known since ancient times  ethanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of   dried residue on 9,000-year-old pottery found in china suggests that
people consumed alcoholic beverages 
although
was well known by the early greeks and arabs  the first recorded production of alcohol from distilled wine was by the
alchemists in the 12th century  the first to mention absolute alcohol  in contrast with alcohol-water mixtures  was  
in 1796  german-russian chemist    obtained pure ethanol by mixing partially purified ethanol  the alcohol-water azeotrope  with an excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat  french chemist
described ethanol as a compound of carbon  hydrogen  and oxygen  and in 1807
determined ethanol s chemical formula  fifty years later 
published the structural formula of ethanol  it was one of the first structural formulas determined 
ethanol was first prepared synthetically in 1825 by   he found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of   he gave the resulting solution to   a british chemist  who found in 1826 that it contained  sulphovinic acid      in 1828  hennell and the french chemist
independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol  thus  in 1825 faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from
 a component of coal gas  by
hydration  a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis 
ethanol was used as lamp fuel in the united states as early as 1840  but a tax levied on industrial alcohol during the
made this use uneconomical  the tax was repealed in 1906  use as an automotive fuel dates back to 1908  with the
able to run on
 gasoline  or ethanol  it fuels some  
ethanol intended for industrial use is often produced from   ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption  including scents  flavorings  colorings  and medicines  in chemistry  it is both a solvent and a feedstock for the synthesis of other products  it has a long history as a fuel for heat and light  and more recently as a fuel for  
society and culture

fosb as a therapeutic biomarker
the strong correlation between chronic drug exposure and fosb provides novel opportunities for targeted therapies in addiction  118   and suggests methods to analyze their efficacy  119   over the past two decades  research has progressed from identifying fosb induction to investigating its subsequent action  38   it is likely that fosb research will now progress into a new era  the use of fosb as a biomarker  if fosb detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure  and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance   then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker  figure 2   examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein    
conclusions
fosb is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure  the formation of fosb in multiple brain regions  and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of ap-1 complexes is well understood  the establishment of a functional purpose for fosb has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades  involving effectors such as glur2  87,88   cdk5  93  and nfkb  100   moreover  many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural  physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure  60,95,97,102   new frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of fosb have been opened by epigenetic studies  and recent advances have illustrated the role of fosb acting on dna and histones  truly as a molecular switch  34   as a consequence of our improved understanding of fosb in addiction  it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications  119   as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions  121,122,124   some of these proposed interventions have limitations  125  or are in their infancy  75   however  it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments  which are much needed in addiction 
nestler ej  december 2013     dialogues clin neurosci  15  4   431443      despite the importance of numerous psychosocial factors  at its core  drug addiction involves a biological process  the ability of repeated exposure to a drug of abuse to induce changes in a vulnerable brain that drive the compulsive seeking and taking of drugs  and loss of control over drug use  that define a state of addiction     a large body of literature has demonstrated that such fosb induction in d1-type nac neurons increases an animal s sensitivity to drug as well as natural rewards and promotes drug self-administration  presumably through a process of positive reinforcement
robison aj  nestler ej  november 2011     nat  rev  neurosci  12  11   623637         fosb has been linked directly to several addiction-related behaviors    importantly  genetic or viral overexpression of jund  a dominant negative mutant of jund which antagonizes fosb- and other ap-1-mediated transcriptional activity  in the nac or ofc blocks these key effects of drug exposure14,2224  this indicates that fosb is both necessary and sufficient for many of the changes wrought in the brain by chronic drug exposure  fosb is also induced in d1-type nac msns by chronic consumption of several natural rewards  including sucrose  high fat food  sex  wheel running  where it promotes that consumption14,2630  this implicates fosb in the regulation of natural rewards under normal conditions and perhaps during pathological addictive-like states     fosb serves as one of the master control proteins governing this structural plasticity
