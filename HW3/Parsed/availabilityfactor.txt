the availability factor of a
is the amount of time that it is able to produce
over a certain period  divided by the amount of the time in the period  occasions where only partial capacity is available may or may not be deducted  where they are deducted  the metric is titled equivalent availability factor  eaf   the availability factor should not be confused with the   the capacity factor for a period will always be less than the availability factor for the same period  the difference depends on the choice to run the plant or not 
the availability of a power plant varies greatly depending on the type of   the design of the plant and how the plant is operated  everything else being equal  plants that are run less frequently have higher availability factors because they require less maintenance  most   such as  
and
plants  have availability factors between 70  and 90   newer plants tend to have significantly higher availability factors  but preventive maintenance is as important as improvements in design and technology 
have relatively high availability factors  ranging from 80  to 99   gas turbines are commonly used for  
plants and the first stage of
plants 
historically the term only referred to the power plant  as fossil fuel was always available  with the increased impact of renewable energy  the topic of no  fuel   water  wind  sunlight  may confuse the terminology  the availability factor of
and
plants depends on whether or not periods when the plant is operational  but there is no
or   are counted as available  unavailable  or disregarded    if they are only counted as available during favorable times  photovoltaic plants have an availability factor approaching or equal to 100   modern
also have very high availability factors  about 98   however  solar and wind plants have relatively low   wind capacity factors range from 2040  and solar capacity factors in arizona are about 19   this makes wind and solar availability factors much lower if times when sunlight or wind are not available are deducted from the plants availability
