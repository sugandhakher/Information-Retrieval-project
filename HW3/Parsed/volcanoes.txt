earth s volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major  rigid
that float on a hotter  softer layer in its mantle  therefore  on earth  volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are
or   for example  a   such as the   has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart  the

etymology
the word volcano is derived from the name of   a volcanic island in the
of italy whose name in turn comes from   the god of fire in   the study of volcanoes is called   sometimes spelled vulcanology

divergent plate boundaries
main article 
at the   two
diverge from one another as new
is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock  because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates  the release of pressure leads to
expansion and the partial melting of the   causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust  most
are at the bottom of the oceans  therefore  most volcanic activity is submarine  forming new seafloor 
 also known as deep sea vents  are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity  where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level  volcanic islands are formed  for example   
convergent plate boundaries
main article 
zones are places where two plates  usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate  collide  in this case  the oceanic plate subducts  or submerges under the continental plate forming a deep ocean trench just offshore  in a process called   water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge  creating   this magma tends to be very
due to its high
content  so it often does not reach the surface but cools at depth  when it does reach the surface  a volcano is formed  typical examples of this kind of volcano are
and the volcanoes in the  
 hotspots 
main article 
   is the name given to volcanic areas believed to be formed by   which are hypothesized to be columns of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary in a fixed space that causes large-volume melting  because tectonic plates move across them  each volcano becomes dormant and is eventually reformed as the plate advances over the postulated plume  the
have been suggested to have been formed in such a manner  as well as the   with the
being the part of the north american plate currently above the hot spot  this theory is currently under criticism  however 
volcanic features
fissure vent in   source of the
  a shield volcano whose name means  broad shield 
the most common perception of a volcano is of a
mountain  spewing
and poisonous
from a
at its summit  however  this describes just one of the many types of volcano  the features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors  some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by
rather than a summit crater while others have
features such as massive   vents that issue volcanic material  including
and   and gases  mainly   can develop anywhere on the
and may give rise to smaller cones such as
on a flank of hawaii s   other types of volcano include
 or ice volcanoes   particularly on some moons of     and   and   which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity  active mud volcanoes tend to involve temperatures much lower than those of
volcanoes except when the mud volcano is actually a vent of an igneous volcano 
fissure vents
main article 
volcanic fissure vents are flat  linear fractures through which
emerges 
shield volcanoes
main article 
shield volcanoes  so named for their broad  shield-like profiles  are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow a great distance from a vent  they generally do not explode catastrophically  since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica  shield volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings  the hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of shield cones  and they are common in   as well 
lava domes
main article 
lava domes are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava  they are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption  as in the case of   but can also form independently  as in the case of   like stratovolcanoes  they can produce violent  explosive eruptions  but their lava generally does not flow far from the originating vent 
cryptodomes
cryptodomes are formed when viscous lava is forced upward causing the surface to bulge  the
was an example  lava beneath the surface of the mountain created an upward bulge which slid down the north side of the mountain

volcanic cones or cinder cones result from eruptions of mostly small pieces of
and
 both resemble cinders  hence the name of this volcano type  that build up around the vent  these can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters high  most cinder cones erupt only   cinder cones may form as
on larger volcanoes  or occur on their own 
in mexico and
in

of over 60 cinder cones 
based on satellite images it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the solar system too  on the surface of mars and the moon

main article 
stratovolcanoes or composite volcanoes are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers  the
that gives rise to the name  stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions  strato composite volcanoes are made of cinders  ash  and lava  cinders and ash pile on top of each other  lava flows on top of the ash  where it cools and hardens  and then the process repeats  classic examples include
in japan 
in the philippines  and
and
in italy 
throughout  
produced by the
of stratovolcanoes has posed the greatest volcanic hazard to civilizations  not only do stratovolcanoes have greater pressure build up from the underlying lava flow than shield volcanoes  but their fissure vents and
 volcanic cones  have more powerful eruptions  as they are many times under   they are also steeper than shield volcanoes  with slopes of 3035 compared to slopes of generally 510  and their loose

supervolcanoes
main article

a supervolcano usually has a large
and can produce devastation on an enormous  sometimes continental  scale  such volcanoes are able to severely cool global temperatures for many years after the eruption due to the huge volumes of
and ash released into the atmosphere  they are the most dangerous type of volcano  examples include 
in
and
in
 both western united states  
in new zealand 
in   indonesia  and
in tanzania  because of the enormous area they may cover  supervolcanoes are hard to identify centuries after an eruption  similarly 
are also considered supervolcanoes because of the vast amount of
lava erupted  even though the lava flow is   
submarine volcanoes
main article 
see also 
submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor  in shallow water  active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean s surface  in the ocean s deep  the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases  however  they can be detected by
and discoloration of water because of  
is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water  even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water  as compared to air  which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor 
are common near these volcanoes  and
based on dissolved minerals  over time  the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating  
subglacial volcanoes
main article 
subglacial volcanoes develop underneath   they are made up of flat lava which flows at the top of extensive pillow lavas and   when the icecap melts  the lava on top collapses  leaving a flat-topped mountain  these volcanoes are also called     or  uncommonly  mobergs  very good examples of this type of volcano can be seen in iceland  however  there are also tuyas in   the origin of the term comes from   which is one of the several tuyas in the area of the
and
in northern british columbia  tuya butte was the first such
analyzed and so its name has entered the geological literature for this kind of volcanic formation  the

lava composition
another way of classifying volcanoes is by the composition of material erupted  lava   since this affects the shape of the volcano  lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions  cas   wright  1987  
if the erupted
contains a high percentage   63   of   the lava is called  
felsic lavas   or   tend to be highly
 not very fluid  and are erupted as domes or short  stubby flows  viscous lavas tend to form
or lava domes 
in california is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome 
because siliceous magmas are so viscous  they tend to trap
 gases  that are present  which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically  eventually forming stratovolcanoes 
   are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes  since they are composed of molten volcanic ash too heavy to go up into the atmosphere  so they hug the volcano s slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions  temperatures as high as 1,200c are known to occur in pyroclastic flows  which will incinerate everything flammable in their path and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down  often up to many meters thick   s   formed by the eruption of
near
in 1912  is an example of a thick pyroclastic flow or ignimbrite deposit  volcanic ash that is light enough to be erupted high into the
may travel many kilometres before it falls back to ground as a  
if the erupted magma contains 5263  silica  the lava is of intermediate composition 
these    volcanoes generally only occur above
 e g 
in indonesia  
andesitic lava is typically formed at
margins of   by several processes 
hydration melting of peridotite and fractional crystallization
eruption    oblique satellite view
melting of subducted
containing sediments  
magma mixing between felsic rhyolitic and mafic basaltic magmas in an intermediate reservoir prior to emplacement or lava flow 
if the erupted magma contains  52  and  45  silica  the lava is called
 because it contains higher percentages of
 mg  and iron  fe   or   these lavas are usually much less viscous than rhyolitic lavas  depending on their eruption temperature  they also tend to be hotter than felsic lavas  mafic lavas occur in a wide range of settings 
at   where two oceanic plates are pulling apart  basaltic lava erupts as
to fill the gap 
 e g  the   including
and    on both
and  
as continental  
some erupted magmas contain   45  silica and produce
lava  ultramafic flows  also known as   are very rare  indeed  very few have been erupted at the earth s surface since the   when the planet s heat flow was higher  they are  or were  the hottest lavas  and probably more fluid than common mafic lavas 
lava texture
two types of lava are named according to the surface texture  aa  pronounced   and
    both
words  aa is characterized by a rough  clinkery surface and is the typical texture of viscous lava flows  however  even basaltic or mafic flows can be erupted as aa flows  particularly if the eruption rate is high and the slope is steep 
phoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows  usually  only mafic flows will erupt as phoehoe  since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow with greater fluidity

popular classification of volcanoes
a popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes is by their frequency of     with those that erupt regularly called active  those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called dormant or inactive  and those that have not erupted in historical times called extinct  however  these popular classificationsextinct in particularare practically meaningless to scientists  they use classifications which refer to a particular volcano s formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes  which was explained above 
active
see also      and
there is no consensus among volcanologists on how to define an  active  volcano  the lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years  making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations  for example  many of earth s volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption  given the long lifespan of such volcanoes  they are very active  by human lifespans  however  they are not 
scientists usually consider a volcano to be erupting or likely to erupt if it is currently erupting  or showing signs of unrest such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions  most scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years   times   the smithsonian
uses this definition of active  most volcanoes are situated on the   an estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes 
historical time  or recorded history  is another timeframe for active  the catalogue of the active volcanoes of the world  published by the   uses this definition  by which there are more than 500 active volcanoes  however  the span of recorded history differs from region to region  in china and the   it reaches back nearly 3,000 years  but in the pacific northwest of the united states and canada  it reaches back less than 300 years  and in hawaii and   only around 200 years

technical classification of volcanoes
volcanic-alert level
the three common popular classifications of volcanoes can be subjective and some volcanoes thought to have been extinct have erupted again  to help prevent people from falsely believing they are not at risk when living on or near a volcano  countries have adopted new classifications to describe the various levels and stages of volcanic activity  some alert systems use different numbers or colors to designate the different stages  other systems use colors and words  some systems use a combination of both 
volcano warning schemes of the united states
the united states geological survey  usgs  has adopted a common system nationwide for characterizing the level of unrest and eruptive activity at volcanoes  the new volcano alert-level system classifies volcanoes now as being in a normal  advisory  watch or warning stage  additionally  colors are used to denote the amount of ash produced  details of the u s  system can be found at
