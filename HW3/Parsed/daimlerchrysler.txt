history  
daimler ag is a german manufacturer of automobiles  motor vehicles  and engines  which dates back more than a century 
an agreement of mutual interest was signed on 1 may 1924 between
 founded 1883 by   and
 founded 1890 by
and   
both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine brands until  on 28 june 1926  when benz   cie  and daimler motoren gesellschaft ag formally mergedbecoming
and agreed that  thereafter  all of the factories would use the brand name of
on their automobiles 
in 1998  daimler-benz and chrysler corporation announced the world s largest cross-border deal ever  valued at us 38billion  and the resulting change in company name to  daimlerchrysler ag  
in 2007  when the chrysler group was sold off to
 see below   the name of the parent company was changed to simply  daimler ag  
in november 2014  daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of italian motorcycle producer

merger with chrysler  
main article 
the former logo of daimler chrysler ag 
in a so-called  merger of equals   or  marriage made in heaven   according to its then ceo and architect  
ag and -based automobile manufacturer   the smallest of the three american automakers  merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as daimler-benz ag bought 92  of chrysler  and 8  of chrysler remained independent and formed daimlerchrysler ag  the terms of the merger allowed  s non-automotive businesses such as    debis ag  for short   created in 1989 to handle data processing  financial and insurance services  and real estate management for the daimler group  to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion  debis ag reported revenues of  8.6 bn  dm 15.5 bn  in 1997 
the merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the  merger of equals  that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a daimler-benz takeover of chrysler  a
investor lawsuit was settled in august 2003 for us 300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist
was dismissed on 7 april 2005  the transaction claimed the job of its architect  chairman jrgen e  schrempp  who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company s share price following the transaction  the merger was also the subject of a book taken for a ride  how daimler-benz drove off with chrysler   2000  by bill vlasic and bradley a  stertz 
another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses    concept of a platform strategy like the vw group  was implemented only for a few models  so the synergy effects in development and production were too low  as late as 2002  daimlerchrysler appeared to run two independent product lines  later that year  the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company  including the   which was based on the mercedes slk platform and utilized mercedes s 3.2l v6  and the    a re-badged
van 
sale of chrysler  
daimler agreed to sell the chrysler unit to
in may 2007 for us 6 billion    through most of its history  chrysler has been the smallest of the  big 3  u s  automakers  but in january 2007  daimlerchrysler  excluding its luxury mercedes and maybach lines  also outsold traditionally second place ford  though behind general motors and toyota 
chrysler reported losses of us 1.5 billion in 2006  it then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-february 2007  close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008 
daimlerchrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell chrysler in early 2007 
was reported to be a suitor  but on 3 august 2007  daimlerchrysler completed the sale of chrysler group to   the original agreement stated that cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company  chrysler holding llc  daimlerchrysler changed its name to daimler ag and retained the remaining 19.9  stake in the separated chrysler 
the terms saw daimler pay cerberus us 650 million to take chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands  of the us 7.4 billion purchase price 
was to invest us 5 billion in chrysler holdings and us 1.05 billion in chrysler s financial unit  the de-merged daimler ag received us 1.35 billion directly from cerberus but directly invested us 2 billion in chrysler itself 
since chrysler s   chrysler has been controlled by italian automaker
and is  as of 2016  still working to integrate chrysler s products into the fiat portfolio  such as
and chrysler s   and fiat s
with   interestingly despite the fact it had been nearly a decade since the daimler chrysler split  the fourth-generation
shares a platform with the   this also includes the

automated cars  
on 3 august 2015

digital maps division to a consortium of three german automakers  daimler ag  and   for 2.8 billion  this was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars

daimler also owns   which as of 2014 supplies engines to   mclaren and   in addition to mercedes amg petronas 
bribery and corruption  
on 1 april 2010  daimler ag s german and russian subsidiaries each plead guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the
and the   daimler itself had to pay us 185 million as a   but the company and its chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year
requiring further cooperation with regulators  adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing  daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period 
additionally    a former director of the   served as an independent monitor to oversee daimler s compliance with anti-bribery laws 
u s  prosecutors accused key executives of daimler  daimler   and daimler
of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world  the investigation for the case revealed that daimler improperly paid some  56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries  including china  russia  turkey  hungary  greece  latvia  serbia and montenegro  egypt and nigeria  among other places  that  in return  awarded the company  1.9 billion in revenue and at least  91.4 million in illegal profits 
the sec case was sparked in 2004 after david bazzetta  a former auditor at then daimlerchrysler corp  filed a
complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by mercedes-benz units in south america  bazzetta alleged that he learned in a july 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in
that business units  continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials   though the company knew the practice violated u s  laws 
in another attempt to silence bazzetta  daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement  but daimler s strategy with bazzetta proved to be a failure as the u s  criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation 
according to the charges  the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies  the bribes also took the form of luxury european vacations  armored mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious dictator of   turkmenbashi     including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal     translated into german 
investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the united nations 
with
by giving
worth 10  of the contract values to officials within the iraqi government  then led by   the sec said the company made more than  4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals 
u s  prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through
based in the u s   in some cases daimler wired these improper payments to u s  bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of u s  shell companies in order to transmit the bribe   the court papers said 
prosecutors said that daimler engaged in a  long-standing practice  of paying bribes  due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice 
 using
accounts  third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices  these companies  daimler ag  its subsidiaries and affiliates  saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business   said   a principal deputy in the justice department s criminal division 
 it is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at daimler as a standard business practice     director of the sec s enforcement division  said in a statement 
 we have learned a lot from past experience   dieter zetsche  chairman of daimler s board  said in a statement 
as per the agreement with prosecutors  the two daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the   which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business  the foreign corrupt practices act applies to any company that lists its shares on u s    daimler ag was listed with the symbol  dai  on the   giving the justice department jurisdiction over the german car maker s payments in countries around the globe 
judge
of the united states district court in washington  d c   approved the plea agreement and settlement  calling it a  just resolution  
the primary case is usa v  daimler ag    no  1 10-cr-00063-rjl  
notes  
press release by
jaguar now shares the rights to the daimler name with daimler ag  the german car manufacturer created when daimlerchrysler was split up  jaguar agreed terms in 2007 which allow the german company to use the daimler brand as the title of a trading company  a trade name or a corporate name  rights that it did not hold previously  the renegotiated terms did not affect jaguar s rights to build daimler cars  a spokesman for jaguar said  the extended usage agreement does not affect either company s existing right to use the daimler name for a product   the times 28 july 2008
