a virtual power plant  vpp  is a system that integrates several types of power sources   such as         back-up   and batteries  so as to give a reliable overall power supply  the sources are often a cluster of
systems  and are often orchestrated by a central authority 
in the competitive electricity markets  a virtual power plant acts as an arbitrageur by exercising arbitrage between diverse energy trading oors

overview  
the concerted operational mode delivers extra benefits such as the ability to deliver peak load electricity or load-aware power generation at short notice  such a vpp can replace a conventional power plant while providing higher efficiency and more flexibility  note that more flexibility allows the system to react better to uctuations  however  a vpp is also a complex system requiring a complicated optimization  control  and secure communication methodology 
according to a 2014 report by pike research  the vpp market will continue its steady growth over the next several years  increasing from  5.2 billion in worldwide revenue in 2010 to nearly  7.4 billion by 2015  under a base case scenario  in a more aggressive forecast scenario  the clean tech market intelligence firm forecasts that global vpp revenues could reach as high as  12.7 billion during the same period 
 virtual power plants represent an internet of energy   says senior analyst peter asmus of pike research   these systems tap existing grid networks to tailor electricity supply and demand services for a customer  vpps maximize value for both the end user and the distribution utility using a sophisticated set of software-based systems  they are dynamic  deliver value in real time  and can react quickly to changing customer load conditions

an often-reported energy crisis in america has opened up the door for government subsidized companies to enter an arena that has only been available for utilities multinational billion dollar companies until now  with the deregulation of markets around the united states  the wholesale market pricing used to be the exclusive domain of large retail suppliers  however local and federal legislation along with large end-users are beginning to recognize the advantages of wholesale activities 
energy markets are those
that deal specifically with the trade and supply of energy  in california there are two markets  private retail electrical market   wholesale electrical market  california is the leader in green technology with governmental bodies subsidizing and pushing an agenda that is not shared by much of the rest of the united states  senate bill 2x passed california legislature march 30  2011  mandates 33  renewable by 2020 without any particular method to get there 
in the united states  virtual power plants not only deal with the supply side  but also help manage demand and ensure reliability of grid functions through demand response  dr  and other load shifting approaches  in real time

in august 2016
announced a 5mw virtual power plant scheme for   australia  the company will supply
and
systems to 1000 households and businesses  the systems will cost consumers
 3500 and are expected to pay back in 7years under current
tariffs  the scheme itself is worth aud  20million and is being billed as the largest in the world
