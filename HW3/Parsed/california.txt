the word california originally referred to the entire region composed of the
of mexico  the current united states states of california    and   and parts of    
and    
the name california is surmised by some writers to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by
and ruled by queen   who fought alongside muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a muslim leader  the caliph  fictionally implying that california was the caliphate  the story of calafia is recorded in a 1510 work   written as a sequel to
by spanish adventure writer   the kingdom of queen calafia  according to montalvo  was said to be a remote land inhabited by
and other strange beasts  and rich in gold 
know ye that at the right hand of the indies there is an island called california  very close to that part of the terrestrial paradise  which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them  and they lived in the manner of amazons  they were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue  the island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks 
chapter clvii of
when spanish explorer
was exploring the western coast of north america  his initial surveys of the
led him to believe that it was an island rather than part of the larger continent  so he dubbed the  island  after the mythical island in montalvo s writing

from mexico  previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants has dropped to zero less than zero  since more mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating  as a result it is estimated that hispanics citizens will constitute 49  of the population by 2060  instead of the previously projected 2050  due primarily to domestic births

has been shrinking in recent years  due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers  the number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the mexican border in the southwest plunged from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to just 367,000 in 2011  despite these recent trends

california s interconnected water system is the world s largest  managing over 40,000,000 acre feet of water per year  centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects  water use and conservation in california is a politically divisive issue  as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors  especially in the arid southern portion of the state  the state s widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists 
the   a conflict between los angeles and the owens valley over water rights  is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies  former california governor arnold schwarzenegger said   we ve been in crisis for quite some time because we re now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s  so it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban  and everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water
