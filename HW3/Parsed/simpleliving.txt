economics  
a new economics movement has been building since the un conference on the environment in 1972  and the publication that year of only one earth    and blueprint for survival  followed in 1973 by   economics as if people mattered 
recently  david wann has introduced the idea of simple prosperity as it applies to a
lifestyle  from his point of view  and as a point of departure for what he calls real   it is important to ask ourselves three fundamental questions  what is the point of all our commuting and consuming  what is the economy for  and  finally  why do we seem to be unhappier now than when we began our initial pursuit for rich abundance  in this context  simple living is the opposite of our modern quest for affluence and  as a result  it becomes less preoccupied with quantity and more concerned about the preservation of cities  traditions and nature 
a reference point for this new economics can be found in  s a new economics of sustainable development  and the work of thinkers and activists  who participate in his working for a sane alternative network and program  according to robertson  the shift to sustainability is likely to require a widespread shift of emphasis from raising incomes to reducing costs 
the principles of the new economics  as set out by robertson  are the following 
systematic
of people  as opposed to making and keeping them dependent   as the basis for people-centred development
systematic conservation of resources and   as the basis for environmentally sustainable development
evolution from a wealth of nations model of economic life to a one-world model  and from today s inter-national economy to an ecologically sustainable  decentralising  multi-level one-world economic system
restoration of
and
factors to a central place in economic life and thought
respect for
values  not just quantitative values
