technologies are technologies that relate to the production and use of hydrogen  hydrogen technologies are applicable for many uses 
some hydrogen technologies are
and could have a role in preventing
and a possible future   hydrogen is a widely used chemical used in various applications including
production 
and energy  hydrogen is not a
  because it is not naturally occurring as a   it is  however widely regarded as an ideal
medium  due to the ease with which electric power can convert water into its hydrogen and oxygen components through
and can be converted back to electrical power using a fuel cell  there are a wide number of different types of fuel and electrolysis cells 
the potential environmental impact depends primarily on the methods used to generate the hydrogen fuel
