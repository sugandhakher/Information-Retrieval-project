law  
the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978  purpa  encouraged
creating a market for power from non-utility power producers
increased efficiency by making use of cogeneration
ending promotional rate structures
encouraging the development of hydroelectric power
the conservation of electric energy and natural gas
non-utility power producers  
energy companies were classified as   and for this reason  most were established with vertically integrated structures  that is  they undertook all the functions of generating  transmitting  and distributing electricity to the customer   utilities became protected as regulated monopolies because it was thought that a company could produce power more efficiently and economically as one company than as several 
purpa started the industry on the road to restructuring and is one of the first laws that began the
of energy companies  the provision which enabled non-utility generators   nugs   to produce power for use by customers attached to a utility s grid broke the previous monopoly in the generation function 
ending promotional rate structure  
utilities offered customers a  rate structure  that decreased the cost per kwh price of electricity with increasing usage  with subsequent increments costing less per unit  purpa eliminated promotional rate structures except when they could be justified by the cost structure of utility companies 
cogeneration  
one provision of purpa is the requirement for increased use of energy   the law forced
to buy power from other more efficient producers  such as cogeneration plants  if that cost was less than the utility s own  avoided cost  rate to the consumer  the avoided cost rate was the additional costs that the electric utility would incur if it generated the required power itself  or if available  could purchase its demand requirements from another source  at the time generally  where demand was growing  this  avoided cost  was considered to be the construction and
costs incurred in the operation of another  
as an effect  the number of cogeneration plants  which produce electric power and steam  increased  these plants are encouraged by the law  on the basis that they harness thermal energy  in the form of usable steam  that would be otherwise wasted if electricity alone was produced  purpa also became the basic legislation that enabled renewable energy providers to gain a toehold in the market  particularly in california  where state authorities were more aggressive in their interpretation of the statute  the portion of the act dealing with cogeneration and small power production appears in us code in   chapter 12  federal regulation and development of power  subchapter ii  regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce  sec 824a-3  cogeneration and small power production 
this led to the establishment of a new class of generating facilities  which would receive special rate and regulatory treatment  generating facilities in this group are known as qualifying facilities  qfs   and fall into two categories  qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities 
renewable energy and hydropower  
purpa provided favorable terms to companies that produced electricity from renewable  non-fossil-fuel  resources 
implementation  
although a federal law  purpa s implementation was left to the   because needs varied  a variety of regulatory regimes developed in states where renewable power resources were needed  available for development  or the generated power could be   little was done in many states where such resources were unavailable  where the demand growth was slower or previously accommodated in planning 
legacy  
purpa is becoming less important  as many of the contracts made under it during the 1980s are expiring    another reason for purpa s reduced significance is that
and open access to electricity transportation by utilities has created a vast market for the purchase of energy and state regulatory agencies have therefore stopped forcing utilities to give contracts to developers of non-utility power projects  however  it is still an important piece of legislation promoting renewable energy because it exempts the developers of such projects from numerous state and federal regulatory regimes 
this
approach presented investment opportunity and government encouragement for more development of environment-friendly  renewable energy projects and technologies  the law created a market in which non-utility
developed  and some energy market players  
critics of purpa cited that power producers signed multi-year cost of electricity contracts at a time when energy prices were high  when oil prices went down  utilities had to honor the rates of those contracts  leading to high power prices 
purpa was the only existing federal law that requires competition in the utility industry and the only law that encourages renewables  if it is cost competitive with conventional polluting resources 
amendment proposals and new legislation  
in february 2005  senator
from
introduced an
to purpa calling for a  
purpa was amended in 2005 by the
by sections 1251 through 1254  there is pending legislation   in the us senate that would amend purpa to require ferc to develop standards for interconnection of
facilities  and that would require electric utilities meeting the purpa size requirement  retail sales of more than 500 million kw hrs  to implement those standards   
one proposed law that would amend purpa is the   the bill was introduced into the
of the
on january 15  2013  and it passed the house on february 13  2013 by a vote of 422-0  if enacted  the bill would change some of the regulations in the united states surrounding
by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created  according to the bill s proponents  current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants  h r  267 would alter those regulations to make it easier for smaller plants to get approval quickly  section 3 of h r  267 amends the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978  purpa  to increase from 5,000 to 10,000
the size of small
projects which the
may exempt from its license requirements
