breeder reactors could  in principle  extract almost all of the energy contained in
or   decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of 100 compared to widely used once-through   which extract less than 1  of the energy in the uranium mined from the earth  the high fuel efficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply or energy used in mining  adherents claim that with   there would be enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy our energy needs for 5 billion years at 1983 s total energy consumption rate  thus making nuclear energy effectively a  
nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s  in broad terms  spent nuclear fuel has two main components  the first consists of   the leftover fragments of fuel atoms after they have been split to release energy  fission products come in dozens of elements and hundreds of isotopes  all of them lighter than uranium  the second main component of spent fuel is
 atoms heavier than uranium   which are generated from uranium or heavier atoms in the fuel when they absorb neutrons but do not undergo fission  all transuranic isotopes fall within the
series on the   and so they are frequently referred to as the actinides 
the physical behavior of the fission products is markedly different from that of the transuranics  in particular  fission products do not themselves undergo fission  and therefore cannot be used for nuclear weapons  furthermore  only seven
isotopes have half-lives longer than a hundred years  which makes their geological storage or disposal less problematic than for transuranic materials 
with increased concerns about nuclear waste  breeding fuel cycles became interesting again because they can reduce actinide wastes  particularly
and   breeder reactors are designed to fission the actinide wastes as fuel  and thus convert them to more fission products 
after    is removed from a light water reactor  it undergoes a complex decay profile as each nuclide decays at a different rate  due to a physical oddity referenced below  there is a large gap in the decay half-lives of fission products compared to transuranic isotopes  if the transuranics are left in the spent fuel  after 1,000 to 100,000 years  the slow decay of these transuranics would generate most of the radioactivity in that spent fuel  thus  removing the transuranics from the waste eliminates much of the long-term radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel 
today s commercial light water reactors do breed some new fissile material  mostly in the form of plutonium  because commercial reactors were never designed as breeders  they do not convert enough uranium-238 into plutonium to replace the
consumed  nonetheless  at least one-third of the power produced by commercial nuclear reactors comes from fission of plutonium generated within the fuel  even with this level of plutonium consumption  light water reactors consume only part of the plutonium and minor actinides they produce  and nonfissile
build up  along with significant quantities of other minor actinides 
conversion ratio  breakeven  breeding ratio  doubling time  and burnup  
one measure of a reactor s performance is the  conversion ratio   the average number of new
atoms created per    all proposed nuclear reactors except specially designed and operated actinide burners experience some degree of conversion  as long as there is any amount of a fertile material within the
of the reactor  some new fissile material is always created 
the ratio of new fissile material in spent fuel to fissile material consumed from the fresh fuel is known as the  conversion ratio  or  breeding ratio  of a reactor 
for example  commonly used light water reactors have a conversion ratio of approximately 0.6  pressurized heavy water reactors    running on natural uranium have a conversion ratio of 0.8  in a breeder reactor  the conversion ratio is higher than 1   breakeven  is achieved when the conversion ratio becomes 1  the reactor produces as much fissile material as it uses 
 doubling time  is the amount of time it would take for a breeder reactor to produce enough new fissile material to create a starting fuel load for another nuclear reactor  this was considered an important measure of breeder performance in early years  when uranium was thought to be scarce  however  since uranium is more abundant than thought  and given the amount of plutonium available in spent reactor fuel  doubling time has become a less important metric in modern breeder reactor design 
   is a measure of how much energy has been extracted from a given mass of heavy metal in fuel  often expressed  for power reactors  in terms of gigawatt-days per ton of heavy metal  burnup is an important factor in determining the types and abundances of isotopes produced by a fission reactor  breeder reactors  by design  have extremely high burnup compared to a conventional reactor  as breeder reactors produce much more of their waste in the form of fission products  while most or all of the actinides are meant to be fissioned and destroyed 
in the past breeder reactor development focused on reactors with low breeding ratios  from 1.01 for the
running on thorium fuel and cooled by conventional light water to over 1.2 for the soviet
liquid-metal-cooled reactor  theoretical models of breeders with liquid sodium coolant flowing through tubes inside fuel elements   tube-in-shell  construction  suggest breeding ratios of at least 1.8 are possible on an industrial scale  the soviet br-1 test reactor achieved a breeding ratio of 2.5 under non-commercial conditions 
types of breeder reactor  
production of heavy transuranic actinides in current thermal-neutron fission reactors through neutron capture and decays  starting at uranium-238  isotopes of plutonium  americium  and curium are all produced  in a fast neutron breeder reactor  all these isotopes may be burned as fuel 
many types of breeder reactor are possible 
a  breeder  is simply a reactor designed for very high neutron economy with an associated conversion rate higher than 1.0  in principle  almost any reactor design could possibly be tweaked to become a breeder  an example of this process is the evolution of the light water reactor  a very heavily moderated thermal design  into the super fast reactor
concept  using light water in an extremely low-density
form to increase the neutron economy high enough to allow breeding 
aside from water cooled  there are many other types of breeder reactor currently envisioned as possible  these include     and
designs in many variations  almost any of these basic design types may be fueled by uranium  plutonium  many minor actinides  or thorium  and they may be designed for many different goals  such as creating more fissile fuel  long-term steady-state operation  or active burning of nuclear wastes 
for convenience  it is perhaps simplest to divide the extant reactor designs into two broad categories based upon their neutron spectrum  which has the natural effect of dividing the reactor designs into those designed to use primarily uranium and transuranics  and those designed to use thorium and avoid transuranics 
or fbr uses fast  unmoderated  neutrons to breed fissile plutonium and possibly higher transuranics from fertile uranium-238  the fast spectrum is flexible enough that it can also breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium  if desired 
use thermal spectrum  moderated  neutrons to breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium     due to the behavior of the various nuclear fuels  a thermal breeder is thought commercially feasible only with thorium fuel  which avoids the buildup of the heavier transuranics 
reprocessing  
fission of the nuclear fuel in any reactor produces neutron-absorbing   because of this unavoidable physical process  it is necessary to
the fertile material from a breeder reactor to remove those   this step is required if one is to fully utilize the ability to breed as much or more fuel than is consumed  all reprocessing can present a
concern  since it extracts weapons usable material from spent fuel  the most common reprocessing technique    presents a particular concern  since it was expressly designed to separate pure plutonium  early proposals for the breeder reactor fuel cycle posed an even greater proliferation concern because they would use purex to separate plutonium in a highly attractive isotopic form for use in nuclear weapons 
several countries are developing reprocessing methods that do not separate the plutonium from the other actinides  for instance  the non-water based
process  when used to reprocess fuel from an   leaves large amounts of radioactive actinides in the reactor fuel  more conventional advanced  water-based reprocessing systems like purex  include sanex  unex  diamex  coex  and truexas well as proposals to combine purex with co-processes 
all these systems have better proliferation resistance than purex  though their adoption rate is low 
in the thorium cycle  thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233  which then decays to uranium-233  if the protactinium remains in the reactor  small amounts of u-232 are also produced  which has the strong gamma emitter
in its decay chain  similar to uranium-fueled designs  the longer the fuel and fertile material remain in the reactor  the more of these undesirable elements build up  inside the envisioned commercial thorium reactors high levels of u232 would be allowed to accumulate  leading to extremely high gamma radiation doses from any uranium derived from thorium  these gamma rays complicate the safe handling of a weapon and the design of its electronics  this explains why u-233 has never been pursued for weapons beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations

nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s  breeding fuel cycles attracted renewed interest because of their potential to reduce actinide wastes  particularly plutonium and minor actinides  since breeder reactors on a closed fuel cycle would use nearly all of the actinides fed into them as fuel  their fuel requirements would be reduced by a factor of about 100  the volume of waste they generate would be reduced by a factor of about 100 as well  while there is a huge reduction in the volume of waste from a breeder reactor  the
of the waste is about the same as that produced by a light water reactor 
in addition  the waste from a breeder reactor has a different decay behavior  because it is made up of different materials  breeder reactor waste is mostly fission products  while light water reactor waste has a large quantity of transuranics  after
has been removed from a light water reactor for longer than 100,000 years  these transuranics would be the main source of radioactivity  eliminating them would eliminate much of the long-term radioactivity from the spent fuel 
in principle  breeder fuel cycles can recycle and consume all actinides  leaving only   as the graphic in this section indicates  fission products have a peculiar  gap  in their aggregate half-lives  such that no fission products have a half-life longer than 91 years and shorter than two hundred thousand years  as a result of this physical oddity  after several hundred years in storage  the activity of the radioactive waste from a fast breeder reactor would quickly drop to the low level of the   however  to obtain this benefit requires the highly efficient separation of transuranics from spent fuel  if the
methods used leave a large fraction of the transuranics in the final waste stream  this advantage would be greatly reduced 
both types of breeding cycles can reduce actinide wastes 
the  s
can fission actinide nuclei with even numbers of both protons and neutrons  such nuclei usually lack the
  
of fissile fuels used in  
the
inherently produces lower levels of heavy actinides  the fertile material in the thorium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 232  while the fertile material in the uranium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 238  that mass difference means that thorium-232 requires six more neutron capture events per nucleus before the transuranic elements can be produced  in addition to this simple mass difference  the reactor gets two chances to fission the nuclei as the mass increases  first as the effective fuel nuclei u233  and as it absorbs two more neutrons  again as the fuel nuclei u235 
a reactor whose main purpose is to destroy actinides  rather than increasing fissile fuel stocks  is sometimes known as a burner reactor  both breeding and burning depend on good neutron economy  and many designs can do either  breeding designs surround the core by a breeding blanket of fertile material  waste burners surround the core with non-fertile wastes to be destroyed  some designs add neutron reflectors or absorbers 
breeder reactor concepts  
there are several concepts for breeder reactors  the two main ones are 
reactors with a
are called fast breeder reactors  fbr   these typically utilize uranium-238 as fuel 
reactors with a
are called thermal breeder reactors  these typically utilize thorium-232 as fuel 
fast breeder reactor  
schematic diagram showing the difference between the loop and pool types of lmfbr 
in 2006 all large-scale fast breeder reactor  fbr  power stations were
 lmfbr  cooled by liquid   these have been of one of two designs 
loop type  in which the primary coolant is circulated through primary heat exchangers outside the reactor tank  but inside the
due to radioactive sodium-24 in the primary coolant 
  which served as the prototype for the integral fast reactor
pool type  in which the primary heat exchangers and pumps are immersed in the reactor tank
all current
designs use liquid metal as the primary coolant  to transfer heat from the core to steam used to power the electricity generating turbines  fbrs have been built cooled by liquid metals other than sodiumsome early fbrs used   other experimental reactors have used a -
called   both have the advantage that they are liquids at room temperature  which is convenient for experimental rigs but less important for pilot or full scale power stations 
and
have also been   the relative merits of lead vs sodium are discussed   looking further ahead  four of the proposed
types are fbrs 
 gfr  cooled by  
 sfr  based on the existing liquid metal fbr    and
designs 
 lfr  based on soviet naval propulsion units 
 scwr  based on existing lwr and
technology 
fbrs usually use a
core of up to 20 
 puo2  and at least 80 
 uo2   another fuel option is   typically a blend of uranium  plutonium  and
 used because it is  transparent  to neutrons  
can also be used on its own 
many designs surround the core in a blanket of tubes that contain non-fissile uranium-238  which  by capturing fast neutrons from the reaction in the core  converts to fissile
 as is some of the uranium in the core   which is then reprocessed and used as nuclear fuel  other fbr designs rely on the geometry of the fuel itself  which also contains uranium-238   arranged to attain sufficient fast neutron capture  the plutonium-239  or the fissile uranium-235  fission cross-section is much smaller in a fast spectrum than in a thermal spectrum  as is the ratio between the 239pu 235u fission cross-section and the 238u absorption cross-section  this increases the concentration of 239pu 235u needed to sustain a   as well as the ratio of breeding to fission 
on the other hand  a fast reactor needs no
to
at all  taking advantage of the
producing a greater number of neutrons per fission than   for this reason ordinary liquid   being a moderator as well as a   is an undesirable primary coolant for fast reactors  because large amounts of water in the core are required to cool the reactor  the yield of neutrons and therefore breeding of
are strongly affected  theoretical work has been done on   which may have a sufficiently fast spectrum to provide a breeding ratio slightly over 1  this would likely result in an unacceptable power derating and high costs in an
reactor  but the supercritical water coolant of the
has sufficient heat capacity to allow adequate cooling with less water  making a fast-spectrum water-cooled reactor a practical possibility 
the only commercially operating reactor as of 2015 is the
in russia  a 560mw sodium cooled reactor 
integral fast reactor  
one design of fast neutron reactor  specifically designed to address the waste disposal and plutonium issues  was the
 also known as an integral fast breeder reactor  although the original reactor was designed to not breed a net surplus of fissile material  
to solve the waste disposal problem  the ifr had an on-site
fuel reprocessing unit that recycled the uranium and all the
 not just plutonium  via   leaving just short
in the waste  some of these fission products could later be separated for industrial or medical uses and the rest sent to a waste repository  where they would not have to be stored for anywhere near as long as wastes containing long half-life transuranics   the ifr pyroprocessing system uses molten
cathodes and electrorefiners to reprocess metallic fuel directly on-site at the reactor  such systems not only commingle all the minor actinides with both uranium and plutonium  they are compact and self-contained  so that no plutonium-containing material ever needs to be transported away from the site of the breeder reactor  breeder reactors incorporating such technology would most likely be designed with breeding ratios very close to 1.00  so that after an initial loading of enriched uranium and or plutonium fuel  the reactor would then be refueled only with small deliveries of natural uranium metal  a quantity of natural uranium metal equivalent to a block about the size of a milk crate delivered once per month would be all the fuel such a 1gigawatt reactor would need  such self-contained breeders are currently envisioned as the final self-contained and self-supporting ultimate goal of nuclear reactor designers  the project was canceled in 1994 by
 
other fast reactors  
the graphite core of the molten salt reactor experiment
another proposed fast reactor is a fast   in which the molten salt s moderating properties are insignificant  this is typically achieved by replacing the light metal fluorides  e g  lif  bef2  in the salt carrier with heavier metal chlorides  e g   kcl  rbcl  zrcl4  
several prototype fbrs have been built  ranging in electrical output from a few light bulbs  equivalent    1951  to over 1,000  as of 2006  the technology is not economically competitive to thermal reactor technologybut india  japan  china 
and russia are all committing substantial research funds to further development of fast breeder reactors  anticipating that rising uranium prices will change this in the long term  germany  in contrast  abandoned the technology due to safety concerns  the
fast breeder reactor was finished after 19 years despite cost overruns summing up to a total of 3.6 billion euros  only to then be abandoned 
as well as their thermal breeder program 
is also developing fbr technology  using both uranium and thorium feedstocks 
thermal breeder reactor  
the shippingport reactor  used as a prototype light water breeder for five years beginning in august  1977
the
 ahwr  is one of the few proposed large-scale uses of   india is developing this technology  their interest motivated by substantial thorium reserves  almost a third of the world s thorium reserves are in india  which also lacks significant uranium reserves 
the third and final core of the
60mwe reactor was a light water thorium breeder  which began operating in 1977  it used pellets made of
and
oxide  initially  the u-233 content of the pellets was 56  in the seed region  1.53  in the blanket region and none in the reflector region  it operated at 236mwt  generating 60mwe and ultimately produced over 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity  after five years  the core was removed and found to contain nearly 1.4  more fissile material than when it was installed  demonstrating that breeding from thorium had occurred 
the
 lftr  is also planned as a thorium thermal breeder  liquid-fluoride reactors may have attractive features  such as inherent safety  no need to manufacture fuel rods and possibly simpler reprocessing of the liquid fuel  this concept was first investigated at the
in the 1960s  from 2012 it became the subject of renewed interest worldwide  japan  china  the uk  as well as private us  czech and australian companies have expressed intent to develop and commercialize the technology 
breeder reactor controversy  
like many aspects of nuclear power  fast breeder reactors have been subject to much controversy over the years  in 2010 the
said  after six decades and the expenditure of the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars  the promise of breeder reactors remains largely unfulfilled and efforts to commercialize them have been steadily cut back in most countries   in germany  the united kingdom  and the united states  breeder reactor development programs have been abandoned  the rationale for pursuing breeder reactorssometimes explicit and sometimes implicitwas based on the following key assumptions 
it was expected that uranium would be scarce and high-grade deposits would quickly become depleted if fission power were deployed on a large scale  the reality  however  is that since the end of the cold war  uranium has been much cheaper and more abundant than early designers expected 
it was expected that breeder reactors would quickly become economically competitive with the light-water reactors that dominate nuclear power today  but the reality is that capital costs are at least 25  more than water cooled reactors 
it was thought that breeder reactors could be as safe and reliable as light-water reactors  but safety issues are cited as a concern with fast reactors that use a sodium coolant  where a leak could lead to a sodium fire 
it was expected that the proliferation risks posed by breeders and their closed fuel cycle  in which plutonium would be recycled  could be managed  but since plutonium breeding reactors produce plutonium from u238  and thorium reactors produce fissile u233 from thorium  all breeding cycles could theoretically pose proliferation risks 
there are some past anti-nuclear advocates that have become pro-nuclear power as a clean source of electricity since breeder reactors effectively recycle most of their waste  this solves one of the most important negative issues of nuclear power  in the documentary   a case is made for breeder reactors because they provide a real  high kw alternative to fossil fuel energy  according to the movie  one pound of uranium provides as much energy as 5000 barrels of oil 
fbrs have been built and operated in the united states  the united kingdom  france  the former   india and japan  the experimental fbr
was built in germany but never operated and eventually shut down amid political controversy following the   as of 2014 one such reactor was being used for power generation  with another scheduled for early 2015  several reactors are planned  many for research related to the
initiative

 1955  was 100w  thermal  was followed by
at 100kw and then the 5mw  
 first criticality 1969  was 60mw  with construction started in 1965 
future plants  
in 2012 an fbr called the
was under construction in india  due to be completed that year  with commissioning date known by mid-year  the fbr program of india includes the concept of using fertile thorium-232 to breed fissile uranium-233  india is also pursuing the thorium thermal breeder reactor  a thermal breeder is not possible with purely uranium plutonium based technology  thorium fuel is the strategic direction of the power program of india  owing to the nation s large reserves of thorium  but worldwide known reserves of thorium are also some four times those of uranium  india s department of atomic energy  dae  said in 2007 that it would simultaneously construct four more breeder reactors of 500mwe each including two at kalpakkam 
the new indian
is being used to advance these plans  the fbr-600 is a pool-type sodium cooled reactor with a rating of 600mwe and advanced active and passive safety features   
the chinese experimental fast reactor is a 65
 thermal   20 mw  electric   sodium-cooled  pool-type reactor with a 30-year design lifetime and a target
of 100 mwd kg 
the
 cefr  is a 25mw e  prototype for the planned china prototype fast reactor  cfrp   it started generating power on 21 july 2011 
china also initiated a research and development project in thorium molten-salt thermal breeder reactor technology  liquid fluoride thorium reactor   formally announced at the
 cas  annual conference in january 2011  its ultimate target is to investigate and develop a thorium-based molten salt nuclear system over about 20 years 
kirk sorensen  former nasa scientist and chief nuclear technologist at   has long been a promoter of
and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors  in 2011  sorensen founded   a company aimed to develop 20-50mw lftr reactor designs to power military bases 
is developing a design for a standardized modular fbr for export  to complement the standardized
 pressurized water reactor  and
designs they have already developed and built  but has not yet committed to building a prototype 
a cutaway model of the bn-600 reactor  superseded by the
family 
russia has a plan for increasing its fleet of fast breeder reactors significantly  a
 800mwe  at
was completed in 2012  succeeding a smaller   in june 2014 the
was started in the minimum power mode  the reactor working at 35  of the nominal efficiency  was plugged-in the energy network on 10 december 2015 
plans for the construction of an even larger
 1,200mwe  initially anticipated completion in 2018  with two additional bn-1200 reactors built by the end of 2030  however  in 2015
postponed construction indefinitely to allow fuel design to be improved after more experience of operating the   and amongst cost concerns 
an experimental lead-cooled fast reactor 
will be built at the
 scc  in   the brest design is seen as a successor to the bn series and the 300mwe unit at the scc could be the forerunner to a 1,200mwe version for wide deployment as a commercial power generation unit  the development program is as part of an advanced nuclear technologies federal program 2010-2020 that seeks to exploit fast reactors as a way to be vastly more efficient in the use of uranium while  burning  radioactive substances that otherwise would have to be disposed of as waste  brest refers to bystry reaktor so svintsovym teplonositelem  russian for  fast reactor with lead coolant   its core would measure about 2.3 metres in diameter by 1.1 metres in height and contain 16 tonnes of fuel  the unit would be refuelled every year  with each fuel element spending five years in total within the core  lead coolant temperature would be around 540c  giving a high efficiency of 43   primary heat production of 700mwt yielding electrical power of 300mwe  the operational lifespan of the unit could be 60 years  the design is expected to be completed by nikiet in 2014 for construction between 2016 and 2020 
construction of the bn-800 reactor
on february 16  2006  the u s   france and japan signed an  arrangement  to research and develop sodium-cooled fast reactors in support of the   in april 2007 the japanese government selected
as the  core company in fbr development in japan   shortly thereafter  mhi started a new company 
 mfbr  to develop and eventually sell fbr technology 
the

gen-iv reactor 
in september 2010 the french government allocated 651.6 million euros to the
to finalize the design of  astrid   advanced sodium technological reactor for industrial demonstration   a 600mw reactor design of the 4th generation to be operational in 2020  as of 2013 the uk had shown interest in the
reactor and was working in concert with france to develop

fast breeder reactor prior to the design receiving full
licensing approval  in october 2011
reported that the uk nuclear decommissioning authority  nda  and senior advisers within the department for energy and climate change  decc  had asked for technical and financial details of the prism  partly as a means of reducing the country s plutonium stockpile 
the
proposed in a patent by
is a fast breeder reactor designed to not need fuel reprocessing during the decades-long lifetime of the reactor  the breed-burn wave in the twr design does not move from one end of the reactor to the other but gradually from the inside out  moreover  as the fuel s composition changes through nuclear transmutation  fuel rods are continually reshuffled within the core to optimize the neutron flux and fuel usage at any given point in time  thus  instead of letting the wave propagate through the fuel  the fuel itself is moved through a largely stationary burn wave  this is contrary to many media reports  which have popularized the concept as a candle-like reactor with a burn region that moves down a stick of fuel  by replacing a static core configuration with an actively managed  standing wave  or  soliton  core   s design avoids the problem of cooling a highly variable burn region  under this scenario  the reconfiguration of fuel rods is accomplished remotely by robotic devices  the containment vessel remains closed during the procedure  and there is no associated downtime
