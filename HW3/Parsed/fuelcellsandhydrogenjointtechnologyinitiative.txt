the framework programmes for research and technological development  also called framework programmes or abbreviated fp1 to fp7 with  fp8  being named  horizon 2020   are funding programmes created by the   to support and foster research in the
 era   the specific objectives and actions vary between funding periods  in fp6 and fp7 focus was still in technological research  in horizon 2020 the focus is in innovation  delivering economic growth faster and delivering solutions to end users that are often governmental agencies

background  
conducting european research policies and implementing european research programmes is an obligation under the   which includes a chapter on research and technological development  the programmes are defined by commission civil servants that are aided by various official advisory group and lobby groups  e g  to advise the
on the overall strategy to be followed in carrying out the information and communication technology thematic priority  the information society technologies advisory group  istag  was set up 
the framework programmes  
the framework programmes up until framework programme 6  fp6  covered five-year periods  but from framework programme 7  fp7  on  programmes run for seven years  the framework programmes  and their budgets in billions of euros  are presented in the table below  for fp1fp5  program expenditures were made in   from fp6 onward budgets were in euros  the values presented below are in euros

funding instruments  
fp6 and fp7  
framework programme 6 and 7  200213  projects were generally funded through instruments  the most important of which are listed below 
integrating project  ip 
medium- to large-sized collaborative research projects funded in fp6 and fp7  they are composed of a minimum of three partners coming from three different countries from
but can join several tens of partners  the typical duration of such projects is three to five years but there is not a defined upper limit  the budget granted by the commission can reach several tens of million euros  paid as a fraction of the actual costs spent by the participants 
ips specifically aim at fostering european competitiveness in
and
with a focus on  addressing major needs in society  defined by the priority themes of the framework programme  like streps  see below   ips ask for a strong participation of
to ascertain the translation of research results into commercially viable products or services 
network of excellence  noe 
medium-sized research projects co-funded by the european commission in fp6 and fp7  these projects are  designed to strengthen scientific and technological excellence on a particular research topic through the durable integration of the research capacities of the participants  
noe projects require the minimum participation of three different eu member nations  however  projects are usually expected to involve at least six countries  projects are provided grants for a maximum of seven years  the budget granted by the commission is 16million per year depending upon the number of researchers involved 
an noe project should not strictly be considered as a research project  since its aim is not to conduct research  but rather to contribute to the clarification of the concepts in the covered field   
specific targeted research projects  strep 
medium-sized research projects funded by the european commission in the fp6 and fp7 funding programs  strep projects are composed by a minimum of three partners coming from three different countries from associated states  the typical duration of such projects is two to three years  in fp6  they generally involved between six and 15 partners  the budget granted by the commission is in average around 2 million 
horizon 2020  
horizon 2020 is the eighth framework programme funding research  technological development  and innovation  the programme s name has been modified to  framework programme for research and innovation   the framework programme is implemented by the european commission  the executive body of the   either by various internal directorate general  dgs   such as the directorate general for research and innovation    or the directorate general for communications networks  content and technology  or by executive agencies such as the research executive agency  rea   the executive agency for smes  easme   or the erc executive agency  ercea   the framework programme s objective is to complete the
 era  by coordinating national research policies and pooling research funding in some areas to avoid duplication  horizon 2020 itself is seen as a policy instrument to implement other high-level policy initiatives of the european union  such as
and innovation union  the programme runs from 201420 and provides an estimated 80 billion of funding  an increase of 23 per cent on the previous phase 
horizon 2020 provides grants to research and innovation projects through open and competitive calls for proposals  legal entities from any country are eligible to submit project proposals to these calls  participation from outside the european union is explicitly encouraged  participants from european union member states and countries associated to horizon 2020 are automatically funded  associated countries have signed an association agreement for the purposes of this framework programme  to date  14 countries are associated to horizon 2020  switzerland is considered as  partly associated  due to the
held by   which free movement of workers between switzerland and the eu  swiss organisations continue to be active participants in horizon 2020  however  their participation is sometimes covered by national funding 
is an  associated country  to horizon 2020  a central point of negotiation was funding to projects beyond the    israel published its views in an appendix to the official documents  horizon 2020 supports
to research results  in order to create greater efficiency  improve transparency and accelerate innovation 
horizon 2020 is also implementing the   which is aimed at defining and turning into reality a transformative agenda for greening the economy and the society as a whole so as to achieve a truly sustainable development 
structure  
the programme consists of three main research areas that are called  pillars  
the first pillar   excellent science   focuses on basic science  it has a budget of 24 billion euro  the
 erc  delivers 13 billion euro to researchers and teams of researchers based on scientific excellence of the applications  this pillar funds future and emerging technologies  fet  2.7 billion  and researcher mobility   action  msca   6.1 billion  and large european research infrastructures  2.5 billion  
msca supports the career development and training of researchers at all stages of their careers  it is the main eu programme for doctoral training funding 25,000 phds during seven years  it co-funds national phd programmes  other msca funding targets research networks  fellowships for individual researchers  research staff exchanges and arrange  european researchers  night -event annually on the last friday of september 
the second pillar is  industrial leadership   with a budget of 14 billion euro  it is managed by dg enterprise and based on europe 2020 and innovation union strategies  the pillar consists of six sub-programmes within  leadership in enabling and industrial technologies  
information and communication technologies
nanotechnologies
advanced materials
advanced manufacturing and processing
biotechnology
space
these technologies all have european technology platforms  etp  fora for research communities to meet  with their respective strategic research agendas  sra   some technologies have long term funding instruments  such as joint technology initiatives  jti   some technologies are labelled key enabling technologies  ket  
this pillar contains special efforts to sme funding and gives also risk financing  2.8 billion euro  e g  through loans of the european investment bank 
the third pillar funds potential solutions to social and economic problems   societal challenges   sc   in the following seven sub-programmes 
health  7.5 billion 
food  water  forestry  bioeconomy  3.8 billion 
energy  5.9 billion 
transport  6.3 billion 
climate action  environment  resource efficiency  and raw materials  3.1 billion 
european society  1.3 billion 
security  1.7 billion 
this pillar also funds themes names as  science with and for society   0.5 billion  and  spreading excellence and widening participation   0.8 billion  
the structure follows the previous framework programme  fp7  200713  to the level of the sub-programmes under the pillars  in the industrial pillar the goal is to find ways to modernize european industries that have suffered from a fragmented european market  in societal challenges the goal is implementation of solutions  less on technology development 
illustrative projects  
openaire  
a network of open access repositories  archives and journals that support open access policies  the openaire consortium is a
 fp8  project  aimed to support the implementation of the
and
policies 
 
its successor openaireplus is aimed at linking the aggregated research publications to the accompanying research and project information  datasets and author information 
open access to scientific peer reviewed publications has evolved from a pilot project with limited scope in fp7 to an underlying principle in the horizon 2020 funding scheme  obligatory for all h2020 funded projects 
the goal is to make as much european funded research output as possible available to all  via the openaire portal 
   openaire eu faq
the
research data repository is a product of openaire  the openaire portal is at
criticism of the programmes  
the programmes have been criticized on various grounds  such as actually diminishing europe s industrial competitiveness and failing to deliver fundamental excellence and global economic competitiveness  in 2010  the
launched a petition calling for a simplification of administrative procedures  which attracted over 13,000 signatories  the numerous other criticisms of the petitioners were later distilled into a green paper  in horizon 2020 there are significant simplifications  e g  fewer funding rates  increasing the funding rates of the large companies   less reporting  less auditing  shorter time from proposal to project kick-off
