history  
physical discoveries  
fluorescence of certain rocks and other substances had been observed for hundreds of years before its nature was understood  by the middle of the 19th century  experimenters had observed a radiant glow emanating from partially evacuated glass vessels through which an
passed  one of the first to explain it was the irish scientist
from the   who named the phenomenon  fluorescence  after   a mineral many of whose samples glow strongly due to impurities  the explanation relied on the nature of electricity and light phenomena as developed by the british scientists
in the 1840s and
in the 1860s 
little more was done with this phenomenon until 1856 when a german glassblower named
created a
that evacuated a glass tube to an extent not previously possible  when an electric current passed through a   a strong green glow on the walls of the tube at the cathode end could be observed  because it produced some beautiful light effects  the geissler tube was a popular source of amusement  more important  however  was its contribution to scientific research  one of the first scientists to experiment with a geissler tube was
who systematically described in 1858 the luminescent effects that occurred in a geissler tube  he also made the important observation that the glow in the tube shifted position when in proximity to an  
observed in 1859 that certain substances gave off light when they were placed in a geissler tube  he went on to apply thin coatings of luminescent materials to the surfaces of these tubes  fluorescence occurred  but the tubes were very inefficient and had a short operating life 
inquiries that began with the geissler tube continued as even better vacuums were produced  the most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by   that tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury
created by   research conducted by crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the
in 1897 by
and
in 1895 by   but the   as it came to be known  produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated  
early discharge lamps  
one of the first
invented by peter cooper hewitt  1903  it was similar to a fluorescent lamp without the fluorescent coating on the tube  and produced greenish light  the round device under the lamp is the  
while becquerel was interested primarily in conducting scientific research into fluorescence 
briefly pursued fluorescent lighting for its commercial potential  he invented a fluorescent lamp in 1896 that used a coating of
tungstate as the fluorescing substance  excited by   but although it received a patent in 1907  it was not put into production  as with a few other attempts to use geissler tubes for illumination  it had a short operating life  and given the success of the incandescent light  edison had little reason to pursue an alternative means of electrical illumination 
made similar experiments in the 1890s  devising high-frequency powered fluorescent bulbs that gave a bright greenish light  but as with edison s devices  no commercial success was achieved 
although edison lost interest in fluorescent lighting  one of his former employees was able to create a gas-based lamp that achieved a measure of commercial success  in 1895
demonstrated lamps 2 to 3 meters  6.6 to 9.8ft  in length that used
or
to emit white or pink light  respectively  as with future fluorescent lamps  they were considerably more complicated than an incandescent bulb 
peter cooper hewitt
after years of work  moore was able to extend the operating life of the lamps by inventing an electromagnetically controlled valve that maintained a constant gas pressure within the tube  although moores lamp was complicated  was expensive to install  and required very high voltages  it was considerably more efficient than incandescent lamps  and it produced a closer approximation to natural daylight than contemporary incandescent lamps  from 1904 onwards moores lighting system was installed in a number of stores and offices  its success contributed to s motivation to improve the incandescent lamp  especially its filament  ges efforts came to fruition with the invention of a -based filament  the extended lifespan and improved efficacy of incandescent bulbs negated one of the key advantages of moores lamp  but ge purchased the relevant patents in 1912  these patents and the inventive efforts that supported them were to be of considerable value when the firm took up fluorescent lighting more than two decades later 
at about the same time that moore was developing his lighting system  another american was creating a means of illumination that also can be seen as a precursor to the modern fluorescent lamp  this was the   invented by
and patented in 1901    this patent number is frequently misquoted as us 889,692   hewitts lamp glowed when an electric current was passed through mercury vapor at a low pressure  unlike moores lamps  hewitt s were manufactured in standardized sizes and operated at low   the mercury-vapor lamp was superior to the incandescent lamps of the time in terms of energy efficiency  but the blue-green light it produced limited its applications  it was  however  used for photography and some industrial processes 
mercury vapor lamps continued to be developed at a slow pace  especially in europe  and by the early 1930s they received limited use for large-scale illumination  some of them employed fluorescent coatings  but these were used primarily for color correction and not for enhanced light output  mercury vapor lamps also anticipated the fluorescent lamp in their incorporation of a ballast to maintain a constant current 
cooper-hewitt had not been the first to use mercury vapor for illumination  as earlier efforts had been mounted by way  rapieff  arons  and bastian and salisbury  of particular importance was the mercury vapor lamp invented by kch in   this lamp used quartz in place of glass to allow higher   and hence greater efficiency  although its light output relative to electrical consumption was better than that of other sources of light  the light it produced was similar to that of the cooper-hewitt lamp in that it lacked the red portion of the spectrum  making it unsuitable for ordinary lighting 
neon lamps  
main article 
the next step in gas-based lighting took advantage of the luminescent qualities of   an inert gas that had been discovered in 1898 by isolation from the atmosphere  neon glowed a brilliant red when used in geissler tubes  by 1910    a frenchman who had developed a technology and a successful business for air liquefaction  was obtaining enough neon as a byproduct to support a neon lighting industry  while neon lighting was used around 1930 in france for general illumination  it was no more energy-efficient than conventional incandescent lighting  neon tube lighting  which also includes the use of argon and mercury vapor as alternate gases  came to be used primarily for eye-catching signs and advertisements  neon lighting was relevant to the development of fluorescent lighting  however  as claudes improved electrode  patented in 1915  overcame  sputtering   a major source of electrode degradation  sputtering occurred when ionized particles struck an electrode and tore off bits of metal  although claudes invention required
with a lot of surface area  it showed that a major impediment to gas-based lighting could be overcome 
the development of the neon light also was significant for the last key element of the fluorescent lamp  its fluorescent coating  in 1926 jacques risler received a french patent for the application of fluorescent coatings to neon light tubes  the main use of these lamps  which can be considered the first commercially successful fluorescents  was for advertising  not general illumination  this  however  was not the first use of fluorescent coatings  becquerel had earlier used the idea and edison used calcium tungstate for his unsuccessful lamp  other efforts had been mounted  but all were plagued by low efficiency and various technical problems  of particular importance was the invention in 1927 of a low-voltage metal vapor lamp by friedrich meyer  hans-joachim spanner  and   who were employees of a german firm in   a german patent was granted but the lamp never went into commercial production 
commercialization of fluorescent lamps  
all the major features of fluorescent lighting were in place at the end of the 1920s  decades of invention and development had provided the key components of fluorescent lamps  economically manufactured glass tubing  inert gases for filling the tubes  electrical ballasts  long-lasting electrodes  mercury vapor as a source of luminescence  effective means of producing a reliable electrical discharge  and fluorescent coatings that could be energized by ultraviolet light  at this point  intensive development was more important than basic research 
in 1934    a renowned physicist and ge consultant  reported to the ge lamp department on successful experiments with fluorescent lighting at
in great britain  unrelated to general electric in the united states   stimulated by this report  and with all of the key elements available  a team led by george e  inman built a prototype fluorescent lamp in 1934 at s
 ohio  engineering laboratory  this was not a trivial exercise  as noted by arthur a  bright   a great deal of experimentation had to be done on lamp sizes and shapes  cathode construction  gas pressures of both argon and mercury vapor  colors of fluorescent powders  methods of attaching them to the inside of the tube  and other details of the lamp and its auxiliaries before the new device was ready for the public  
in addition to having engineers and technicians along with facilities for r d work on fluorescent lamps  general electric controlled what it regarded as the key patents covering fluorescent lighting  including the patents originally issued to hewitt  moore  and kch  more important than these was a patent covering an
that did not disintegrate at the gas pressures that ultimately were employed in fluorescent lamps  albert w  hull of ges schenectady research laboratory filed for a patent on this invention in 1927  which was issued in 1931  general electric used its control of the patents to prevent competition with its incandescent lights and probably delayed the introduction of fluorescent lighting by 20 years  eventually  war production required 24-hour factories with economical lighting and fluorescent lights became available 
while the hull patent gave ge a basis for claiming
rights over the fluorescent lamp  a few months after the lamp went into production the firm learned of a u s  patent application that had been filed in 1927 for the aforementioned  metal vapor lamp  invented in germany by meyer  spanner  and germer  the patent application indicated that the lamp had been created as a superior means of producing ultraviolet light  but the application also contained a few statements referring to fluorescent illumination  efforts to obtain a u s  patent had met with numerous delays  but were it to be granted  the patent might have caused serious difficulties for ge  at first  ge sought to block the issuance of a patent by claiming that priority should go to one of their employees  leroy j  buttolph  who according to their claim had invented a fluorescent lamp in 1919 and whose patent application was still pending  ge also had filed a patent application in 1936 in inmans name to cover the improvements wrought by his group  in 1939 ge decided that the claim of meyer  spanner  and germer had some merit  and that in any event a long interference procedure was not in their best interest  they therefore dropped the buttolph claim and paid  180,000 to acquire the meyer  et al  application  which at that point was owned by a firm known as electrons  inc  the patent was duly awarded in december 1939  this patent  along with the hull patent  put ge on what seemed to be firm legal ground  although it faced years of legal challenges from   inc   which claimed
on patents that it held 
even though the patent issue would not be completely resolved for many years  general electrics strength in manufacturing and marketing gave it a pre-eminent position in the emerging fluorescent light market  sales of  fluorescent lumiline lamps  commenced in 1938 when four different sizes of tubes were put on the market  they were used in fixtures manufactured by three leading corporations      and globe lighting  the slimline fluorescent ballast s public introduction in 1946 was by westinghouse and general electric and showcase display case fixtures were introduced by
in 1946  during the following year  ge and
publicized the new lights through exhibitions at the
and the
in san francisco  fluorescent lighting systems spread rapidly during world war ii as wartime manufacturing intensified lighting demand  by 1951 more light was produced in the united states by fluorescent lamps than by incandescent lamps

principles of operation  
the fundamental means for conversion of electrical energy into radiant energy in a fluorescent lamp relies on
of electrons when an incident electron collides with an atom in the gas  if the  incident  free electron has enough   it transfers energy to the atom s outer electron  causing that electron to temporarily jump up to a higher   the collision is  inelastic  because a loss of kinetic energy occurs 
this higher energy state is unstable  and the atom will emit an ultraviolet
as the atom s electron reverts to a lower  more stable  energy level  most of the photons that are released from the mercury atoms have
in the
 uv  region of the spectrum  predominantly at wavelengths of 253.7 and 185
 nm   these are not visible to the human eye  so they must be converted into visible light  this is done by making use of   ultraviolet photons are absorbed by electrons in the atoms of the lamp s interior fluorescent coating  causing a similar energy jump  then drop  with emission of a further photon  the photon that is emitted from this second interaction has a lower energy than the one that caused it  the chemicals that make up the phosphor are chosen so that these emitted photons are at wavelengths visible to the human eye  the difference in energy between the absorbed ultra-violet photon and the emitted visible light photon goes toward heating up the phosphor coating 
when the light is turned on  the electric power heats up the cathode enough for it to emit electrons     these electrons collide with and ionize
atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a
by the process of   as a result of   the conductivity of the ionized gas rapidly rises  allowing higher currents to flow through the lamp 
the fill gas helps determine the operating electrical characteristics of the lamp  but does not give off light itself  the fill gas effectively increases the distance that electrons travel through the tube  which allows an electron a greater chance of interacting with a mercury atom  argon atoms  excited to a metastable state by impact of an electron  can impart this energy to a neutral mercury atom and ionize it  described as the   this has the benefit of lowering the breakdown and operating voltage of the lamp  compared to other possible fill gases such as krypton 
construction  
close-up of the cathodes of a
 an essentially similar design that uses no fluorescent phosphor  allowing the electrodes to be seen  
a fluorescent lamp tube is filled with a gas containing low pressure mercury vapor and       or   the pressure inside the lamp is around 0.3  of atmospheric pressure  the inner surface of the lamp is coated with a
 and often slightly   coating made of varying blends of metallic and
salts  the lamp s electrodes are typically made of coiled
and usually referred to as cathodes because of their prime function of emitting electrons  for this  they are coated with a mixture of barium  strontium and calcium oxides chosen to have a low
temperature 
a
uses a low pressure mercury vapor glow discharge identical to that in a fluorescent lamp  but the germicidal lamp uses an uncoated fused quartz envelope so the ultraviolet radiation can escape 
fluorescent lamp tubes are typically straight and range in length from about 100 millimeters  3.9in  for miniature lamps  to 2.43 meters  8.0ft  for high-output lamps  some lamps have the tube bent into a circle  used for table lamps or other places where a more compact light source is desired  larger u-shaped lamps are used to provide the same amount of light in a more compact area  and are used for special architectural purposes 
have several small-diameter tubes joined in a bundle of two  four  or six  or a small diameter tube coiled into a helix  to provide a high amount of light output in little volume 
light-emitting phosphors are applied as a paint-like coating to the inside of the tube  the organic solvents are allowed to evaporate  then the tube is heated to nearly the melting point of glass to drive off remaining organic compounds and fuse the coating to the lamp tube  careful control of the grain size of the suspended phosphors is necessary  large grains  35 micrometers or larger  lead to weak grainy coatings  whereas too many small particles 1 or 2 micrometers or smaller leads to poor light maintenance and efficiency  most phosphors perform best with a particle size around 10 micrometers  the coating must be thick enough to capture all the ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc  but not so thick that the phosphor coating absorbs too much visible light  the first phosphors were synthetic versions of naturally occurring fluorescent minerals  with small amounts of metals added as activators  later other compounds were discovered  allowing differing colors of lamps to be made 
electrical aspects of operation  
different ballasts for fluorescent and discharge lamps
fluorescent lamps are
devices  so as more current flows through them  the electrical resistance of the fluorescent lamp drops  allowing for even more current to flow  connected directly to a   a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct due to the uncontrolled current flow  to prevent this  fluorescent lamps must use an auxiliary device  a   to regulate the current flow through the lamp 
the terminal voltage across an operating lamp varies depending on the
current  tube diameter  temperature  and fill gas  a fixed part of the voltage drop is due to the electrodes  a general lighting service 48-inch  1,219mm  t12 lamp operates at 430ma  with 100 volts drop  high output lamps operate at 800 ma  and some types operate up to 1.5a  the power level varies from 33 to 82 watts per meter of tube length  10 to 25 w ft  for t12 lamps 
the simplest ballast for
 ac  use is an
placed in series  consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic core  the
of this winding limits the flow of ac current  this type is still used  for example  in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps  ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency  where the ac voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps  the ballast is often a step-up
with substantial
 so as to limit the current flow   either form of inductive ballast may also include a
for
correction 
230v ballast for 1820w
many different circuits have been used to operate fluorescent lamps  the choice of circuit is based on ac voltage  tube length  initial cost  long term cost  instant versus non-instant starting  temperature ranges and parts availability  etc 
fluorescent lamps can run directly from a
 dc  supply of sufficient voltage to strike an arc  the ballast must be resistive  and would consume about as much power as the lamp  when operated from dc  the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started  otherwise  the mercury accumulates at one end of the tube  fluorescent lamps are  almost  never operated directly from dc for those reasons  instead  an
converts the dc into ac and provides the current-limiting function as described below for electronic ballasts 
effect of temperature  
thermal image of a helical fluorescent lamp 
the light output and performance of fluorescent lamps is critically affected by the temperature of the bulb wall and its effect on the partial pressure of mercury vapor within the lamp  each lamp contains a small amount of mercury  which must vaporize to support the lamp current and generate light  at low temperatures the mercury is in the form of dispersed liquid droplets  as the lamp warms  more of the mercury is in vapor form  at higher temperatures  self-absorption in the vapor reduces the yield of uv and visible light  since mercury condenses at the coolest spot in the lamp  careful design is required to maintain that spot at the optimum temperature  around 40c  104f  
by using an
with some other metal  the vapor pressure is reduced and the optimum temperature range extended upward  however  the bulb wall  cold spot  temperature must still be controlled to prevent migration of the mercury out of the amalgam and condensing on the cold spot  fluorescent lamps intended for higher output will have structural features such as a deformed tube or internal heat-sinks to control cold spot temperature and mercury distribution  heavily loaded small lamps  such as compact fluorescent lamps  also include heat-sink areas in the tube to maintain mercury vapor pressure at the optimum value 
losses  
a
of energy losses in a fluorescent lamp  in modern designs  the biggest loss is the quantum efficiency of converting high-energy uv photons to lower-energy visible light photons 
only a fraction of the electrical energy input into a lamp is converted to useful light  the ballast dissipates some heat  electronic ballasts may be around 90  efficient  a fixed voltage drop occurs at the electrodes  which also produces heat  some of the energy in the mercury vapor column is also dissipated  but about 85  is turned into visible and ultraviolet light 
the uv light is
by the lamp s
coating  which re-radiates the energy at longer wavelengths to emit   not all the uv energy striking the phosphor gets converted into visible light  in a modern lamp  for every 100 incident photons of uv impacting the phosphor  only 86 visible light photons are emitted  a quantum efficiency of 86    the largest single loss in modern lamps is due to the lower energy of each photon of visible light  compared to the energy of the uv photons that generated them  a phenomenon called    incident photons have an energy of 5.5 electron volts but produce visible light photons with energy around 2.5 electron volts  so only 45  of the uv energy is used  the rest is dissipated as heat  if a so-called  two-photon  phosphor could be developed  this would improve the efficiency but much research has not yet found such a system 
cold-cathode fluorescent lamps  
most fluorescent lamps use electrodes that operate by   meaning they are operated at a high enough temperature for the electrode material  usually aided by a special coating  to emit electrons into the tube by heat 
however  there are also tubes that operate in
mode  whereby electrons are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference    between the electrodes  this does not mean the electrodes are cold  indeed  they can be very hot   but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature  because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out they can have much longer lives than
tubes  this quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications  such as backlights in    sputtering of the electrode may still occur  but electrodes can be shaped  e g  into an internal cylinder  to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode 
cold cathode lamps are generally less efficient than thermionic emission lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher  the increased fall voltage results in more power dissipation at tube ends  which does not contribute to light output  however  this is less significant with longer tubes  the increased power dissipation at tube ends also usually means cold cathode tubes have to be run at a lower loading than their thermionic emission equivalents  given the higher tube voltage required anyway  these tubes can easily be made long  and even run as series strings  they are better suited for bending into special shapes for lettering and signage  and can also be instantly switched on or off 
starting  
the noble gas used in the fluorescent tube  commonly argon  must be ionized before the arc can  strike  within the tube  for small lamps  it does not take much voltage to strike the arc and starting the lamp presents no problem  but larger tubes require a substantial voltage  in the range of a thousand volts

starting a preheat lamp  the automatic starter switch flashes orange each time it attempts to start the lamp 
this technique uses a combination  at each end of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic  bi-metallic  switch  see circuit diagram to the right  that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them  when the arc is struck the filaments are disconnected  this system is described as preheat in some countries and switchstart in others  these systems are standard equipment in 200240v countries  and for 100120v lamps up to about 30watts    
a preheat fluorescent lamp  starter   automatic starting switch 
before the 1960s four-pin thermal starters and manual switches were used    a mechanism then widely used for preheating  still in common use  is a
 illustrated   it consists of a normally open
switch in a small sealed
containing inert gas  neon or argon  
electronic fluorescent lamp starters
when power is first applied to the circuit  there will be a
across the electrodes in the starter lamp  this heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other  when the contacts touch  the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage  the current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by   in the starter  the touching contacts
the voltage sustaining the glow discharge  extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch  which opens within a second or two  the current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted  leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an
which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp  the lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough  in which case the cycle repeats  several cycles are usually needed  which causes flickering and clicking during starting  older thermal starters behaved better in this respect   a
correction  pfc 
draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit 
once the tube strikes  the impinging main discharge keeps the cathodes hot  permitting continued electron emission without the need for the filaments to continue to be heated  the starter switch does not close again because the voltage across the lit tube is insufficient to start a glow discharge in the starter 
with automated starters such as glow starters  a failing tube will cycle endlessly  flickering as the lamp quickly goes out because the
is insufficient to keep the lamp current high enough to keep the glow starter open  this runs the ballast at higher temperature  some more advanced starters time out in this situation  and do not attempt repeated starts until power is reset    some older systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset  the switch contacts in glow starters are subject to wear and inevitably fail eventually  so the starter is manufactured as a plug-in replaceable unit 
more recently introduced electronic starters use a different method to preheat the cathodes  they may be designed to be plug-in interchangeable with glow starters for use in standard fittings  they commonly use a purpose-designed semiconductor switch and  soft start  the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a controlled starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering  this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting  giving longer lamp life than possible with the uncontrolled impulses to which the lamp is subjected in a switchstart  this is claimed to prolong lamp life by a factor of typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use  and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes  the circuit is typically complex  but the complexity is built into the ic  electronic starters may be optimized for fast starting  typical start time of 0.3 seconds   or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages  with a startup time of 24 seconds  the faster-start units may produce audible noise during start-up 
electronic starters only attempt to start a lamp for a short time when power is initially applied  and do not repeatedly attempt to restrike a lamp that is dead and unable to sustain an arc  some automatically shut down a failed lamp  this eliminates the re-striking of a lamp and the continuous flickering of a failing lamp with a glow starter  electronic starters are not subject to wear and do not need replacing periodically  although they may fail like any other electronic circuit  manufacturers typically quote lives of 20 years  or as long as the light fitting  starters are inexpensive  typically less than 50
for the short-lived glow type  depending upon lamp power   and perhaps ten times more for the electronic type as of 2013 
instant start  
another type of tube does not have filaments to start it at all  instant start fluorescent tubes simply use a high enough voltage to break down the gas and mercury column and thereby start arc conduction  these tubes can be identified by a single pin at each end of the tube  the lamp holders have a  disconnect  socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed  to prevent   low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated electronic ballast use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating  although it shortens lamp life   
rapid start  
newer rapid start ballast designs provide filament power windings within the ballast  these rapidly and continuously warm the filaments cathodes using low-voltage ac  usually operating at a lower arc voltage than the instant start design  no inductive
is produced for starting  so the lamps must be mounted near a grounded  earthed  reflector to allow the glow discharge to propagate through the tube and initiate the arc discharge  in some lamps a grounded  starting aid  strip is attached to the outside of the lamp glass 
a rapid-start  iron   magnetic  ballast continually heats the cathodes at the ends of the lamps  this ballast runs two f40t12 lamps in series 
quick-start  
quick-start ballasts use a small auto-transformer to heat the filaments when power is first applied  when an arc strikes  the filament heating power is reduced and the tube will start within half a second  the auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit  tubes need to be mounted near an earthed metal reflector in order for them to strike  quick-start ballasts are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs  a quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a starter switch  a common source of lamp failures  nonetheless  quick-start ballasts are also used in domestic  residential  installations because of the desirable feature that a quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied  when a switch is turned on   quick-start ballasts are used only on 240v circuits and are designed for use with the older  less efficient t12 tubes 
semi-resonant start  
a 65-watt fluorescent lamp starting on a semi-resonant start circuit
a semi-resonant start circuit diagram
the semi-resonant start circuit was invented by thorn lighting for use with
fluorescent tubes  this method uses a double wound transformer and a capacitor  with no arc current  the transformer and capacitor
at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube  and a small electrode heating current  this tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes  but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature  the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage  and the arc strikes  as the electrodes heat  the lamp slowly  over three to five seconds  reaches full brightness  as the arc current increases and tube voltage drops  the circuit provides current limiting 
semi-resonant start circuits are mainly restricted to use in commercial installations because of the higher initial cost of circuit components  however  there are no starter switches to be replaced and cathode damage is reduced during starting making lamps last longer  reducing maintenance costs  due to the high open circuit tube voltage  this starting method is particularly good for starting tubes in cold locations  additionally  the circuit power factor is almost 1.0  and no additional power factor correction is needed in the lighting installation  as the design requires that twice the supply voltage must be lower than the cold-cathode striking voltage  or the tubes would erroneously instant-start   this design cannot be used with 240 volt ac power unless the tubes are at least 1.2m  3ft 11in  length  semi-resonant start fixtures are generally incompatible with energy saving t8 retrofit tubes  because such tubes have a higher starting voltage than t12 lamps and may not start reliably  especially in low temperatures  recent proposals in some countries to phase out t12 tubes will reduce the application of this starting method 
programmed start  
this is used with electronic ballasts shown below  a programmed-start ballast is a more advanced version of rapid start  this ballast applies power to the filaments first  then after a short delay to allow the cathodes to preheat  applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc  this ballast gives the best life and most starts from lamps  and so is preferred for applications with very frequent power cycling such as vision examination rooms and restrooms with a motion detector switch

while also regulating the current flow in the lamp  some still use an inductance to limit the current  but the higher frequency allows a much smaller inductance to be used  others use a capacitor-transistor combination to replace the inductor  since a transistor and capacitor working together can   these ballasts take advantage of the higher efficacy of lamps operated with higher-frequency current  which rises by almost 10  at 10 khz  compared to efficacy at normal power frequency  when the ac period is shorter than the relaxation time to de-ionize mercury atoms in the discharge column  the discharge stays closer to optimum operating condition  electronic ballasts typically work in rapid start or instant start mode  electronic ballasts are commonly supplied with ac power  which is internally converted to dc and then back to a variable frequency ac waveform  depending upon the capacitance and the quality of constant-current   this can largely eliminate modulation at 100 or 120hz 
low cost ballasts mostly contain only a simple oscillator and series resonant lc circuit  when turned on  the oscillator starts  and resonant current excites the lc circuit  this resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer  this principle is called the
circuit  after a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1kv and the lamp ignites  the process is too fast to preheat the cathodes  so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode  the cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite  a few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient  ptc 
to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments 
more complex electronic ballasts use programmed start  the output frequency is started above the resonance frequency of the output circuit of the ballast  and after the filaments are heated  the frequency is rapidly decreased  if the frequency approaches the
of the ballast  the output voltage will increase so much that the lamp will ignite  if the lamp does not ignite  an electronic circuit stops the operation of the ballast 
many electronic ballasts are controlled by a
or similar  and these are sometimes called digital ballasts  digital ballasts can apply quite complex logic to lamp starting and operation  this enables functions such as testing for broken electrodes and missing tubes before attempting to start  auto detect tube replacement  and auto detection of tube type  such that a single ballast can be used with several different tubes  even those that operate at different arc currents  etc  once such fine grained control over the starting and arc current is achievable  features such as dimming  and having the ballast maintain a constant light level against changing sunlight contribution are all easily included in the embedded microcontroller software  and can be found in various manufacturers  products 
since introduction in the 1990s  high-frequency ballasts have been used in general lighting fixtures with either rapid start or pre-heat lamps  these ballasts convert the incoming power to an output frequency in excess of 20 khz  this increases lamp efficiency  these are used in several applications  including new generation
systems  whereby a 100 watt lamp  e g   f71t12bp  can be lit using 90 watts of actual power while obtaining the same
 measured in lumens  as magnetic ballasts  these ballasts operate with voltages that can be almost 600 volts  requiring some consideration in housing design  and can cause a minor limitation in the length of the wire leads from the ballast to the lamp ends 
end of life  
the end of life failure mode for fluorescent lamps varies depending on how they are used and their control gear type  often the light will turn pink  see   with black burns on the ends of the lamp due to
of
 see below   the lamp may also flicker at a noticeable rate  see    more information about normal failure modes are as follows 
emission mix  
closeup of the filament on a low pressure mercury gas discharge lamp showing white
mix coating on the central portion of the coil acting as   typically made of a mixture of  
and
oxides  the coating is sputtered away through normal use  often eventually resulting in lamp failure 
the    on the lamp filaments  is required to enable electrons to pass into the gas via
at the lamp operating voltages used  the mix is slowly
off by bombardment with electrons and mercury ions during operation  but a larger amount is sputtered off each time the lamp is started with cold cathodes  the method of starting the lamp has a significant impact on this  lamps operated for typically less than 3 hours each switch-on will normally run out of the emission mix before other parts of the lamp fail  the sputtered emission mix forms the dark marks at the lamp ends seen in old lamps  when all the emission mix is gone  the cathode cannot pass sufficient electrons into the gas fill to maintain the gas discharge at the designed lamp operating voltage    ideally  the control gear should shut down the lamp when this happens  however  due to cost 
and sometimes high starting voltage    some control gear will provide sufficient increased operating voltage to continue lighting the lamp in
mode    this will cause overheating of the lamp end and rapid disintegration of the electrodes  filament goes open-circuit  and filament support wires until they are completely gone or the glass cracks  wrecking the low pressure gas fill and stopping the gas discharge 
ballast electronics  
this may occur in
with integral
or in linear lamps  ballast electronics failure is a somewhat random process that follows the standard   there is an initial small peak of early failures  followed by a drop and steady increase over lamp life  life of electronics is heavily dependent on operating temperatureit typically halves for each 10c temperature rise  the quoted average life of a lamp is usually at 25c  77f  ambient  this may vary by country   the average life of the electronics at this temperature is normally greater than this  so at this temperature  not many lamps will fail due to failure of the electronics  in some fittings  the ambient temperature could be well above this  in which case failure of the electronics may become the predominant failure mechanism  similarly  running a compact fluorescent lamp base-up will result in hotter electronics  which can cause shorter average life  particularly with higher power rated ones   electronic ballasts should be designed to shut down the tube when the emission mix runs out as described above  in the case of integral electronic ballasts  since they never have to work again  this is sometimes done by having them deliberately burn out some component to permanently cease operation 
in most cfls the filaments are connected in series  with a small capacitor between them  the discharge  once lit  is in parallel to the capacitor and presents a lower-resistance path  effectively shorting the capacitor out 
phosphor  
the phosphor drops off in efficiency during use  by around 25,000 operating hours  it will typically be half the brightness of a new lamp  although some manufacturers claim much longer half-lives for their lamps   lamps that do not suffer failures of the emission mix or integral ballast electronics will eventually develop this failure mode  they still work  but have become dim and inefficient  the process is slow  and often becomes obvious only when a new lamp is operating next to an old one 
loss of mercury  
as in all mercury-based   mercury is slowly
into the glass      phosphor  and tube electrodes throughout the life of the lamp  until it can no longer function  loss of mercury will take over from failure of the phosphor in some lamps  the failure symptoms are similar  except loss of mercury initially causes an extended run-up time to full light output  and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the mercury runs out and the argon base gas takes over as the primary discharge 
subjecting the tube to asymmetric waveforms  where the total current flow through the tube does not cancel out and the tube effectively operates under a dc bias  causes asymmetric distribution of mercury ions along the tube due to   the localized depletion of mercury vapor pressure manifests as pink luminescence of the base gas in the vicinity of one of the electrodes  and the operating lifetime of the lamp may be dramatically shortened  this can be an issue with some poorly designed  
burned-out filaments  
the filaments can burn out  fail  at the end of the lamp s lifetime  opening the circuit and losing the capability to heat up  both filaments lose function as they are connected in series  with just a simple switch start circuit a broken filament will render the lamp completely useless  filaments rarely burn out or fail open circuit unless the filament becomes depleted of emitter and the control gear is able to supply a high enough voltage across the tube to operate it in
mode  some digital electronic ballasts are capable of detecting broken filaments and can still strike an arc with one or both filaments broken providing there is still sufficient emitter  a broken filament in a lamp attached to a magnetic ballast often causes both lamps to burn out or flicker 
phosphors and the spectrum of emitted light  
light from a fluorescent tube lamp reflected by a cd shows the individual bands of color 
the spectrum of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp is the combination of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor  and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating  the
from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light that is different from those produced by incandescent sources  the relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source  colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions  for example  some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing  a healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting  the extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light s spectral composition  and may be gauged by its
 cri  
color temperature  
main article 
the color temperature of different electric lamps
 cct  is a measure of the  shade  of whiteness of a light source compared with a blackbody  typical incandescent lighting is 2700 k  which is yellowish-white  halogen lighting is 3000 k  fluorescent lamps are manufactured to a chosen cct by altering the mixture of phosphors inside the tube  warm-white fluorescents have cct of 2700 k and are popular for residential lighting  neutral-white fluorescents have a cct of 3000 k or 3500 k  cool-white fluorescents have a cct of 4100 k and are popular for office lighting  daylight fluorescents have a cct of 5000 k to 6500 k  which is bluish-white 
high cct lighting generally requires higher light levels  at dimmer illumination levels  the human eye perceives lower color temperatures as more pleasant  as related through the   so  a dim 2700 k incandescent lamp appears comfortable and a bright 5000 k lamp also appears natural  but a dim 5000 k fluorescent lamp appears too pale  daylight-type fluorescents look natural only if they are very bright

main article 
color rendering index  cri  is a measure of how well colors can be perceived using light from a source  relative to light from a reference source such as daylight or a blackbody of the same   by definition  an incandescent lamp has a cri of 100  real-life fluorescent tubes achieve cris of anywhere from 50 to 98  fluorescent lamps with low cri have phosphors that emit too little red light  skin appears less pink  and hence  unhealthy  compared with incandescent lighting  colored objects appear muted  for example  a low cri 6800 k halophosphate tube  an extreme example  will make reds appear dull red or even brown  since the eye is relatively less efficient at detecting red light  an improvement in color rendering index  with increased energy in the red part of the spectrum  may reduce the overall luminous efficacy 
lighting arrangements use fluorescent tubes in an assortment of tints of white  sometimes   this is because of the lack of appreciation for the difference or importance of differing tube types    mixing tube types within fittings can improve the color reproduction of lower quality tubes 
phosphor composition  
some of the least pleasant light comes from tubes containing the older  halophosphate-type
 chemical formula 5 4 3     3   2    this phosphor mainly emits yellow and blue light  and relatively little green and red  in the absence of a reference  this mixture appears white to the eye  but the light has an incomplete   the cri of such lamps is around 60 
since the 1990s  higher quality fluorescent lamps use either a higher cri halophosphate coating  or a triphosphor mixture  based on
and
ions  that have emission bands more evenly distributed over the spectrum of visible light  high cri halophosphate and triphosphor tubes give a more natural color reproduction to the human eye  the cri of such lamps is typically 82100

halophosphate  ca5 po4 3     sb3   mn2    the color of the light output can be adjusted by altering the ratio of the blue emitting antimony dopant and orange emitting manganese dopant  the color rendering ability of these older style lamps is quite poor  halophosphate phosphors were invented by a h  mckeag et al  in 1942 
 natural sunshine  fluorescent light
peaks with stars are -lines 
yellow fluorescent lights
the spectrum is nearly identical to a normal fluorescent lamp except for a near total lack of light below 500 nanometers  this effect can be achieved through either specialized phosphor use or more commonly by the use of a simple yellow light filter  these lamps are commonly used as lighting for
work in
and as  bug repellent  outdoor lighting  the efficacy of which is questionable  
spectrum of a    lamp
there is typically only one phosphor present in a blacklight lamp  usually consisting of -doped
  which is contained in an envelope of  
applications  
fluorescent lamps come in many shapes and sizes  the
 cfl  is becoming more popular  many compact fluorescent lamps integrate the auxiliary electronics into the base of the lamp  allowing them to fit into a regular light bulb socket 
in us residences  fluorescent lamps are mostly found in     or   but schools and businesses find the cost savings of fluorescent lamps to be significant and rarely use incandescent lights  tax incentives and building codes result in higher use in places such as  
in other countries  residential use of fluorescent lighting varies depending on the price of energy  financial and environmental concerns of the local population  and acceptability of the light output  in
and
it is very rare to see
bulbs in buildings anywhere 
some countries are encouraging the
and substitution of incandescent lamps with fluorescent lamps or other types of energy-efficient lamps 
in addition to general lighting  special fluorescent lights are often used in
for film and video production  they are cooler than traditional halogen light sources  and use high-frequency ballasts to prevent video flickering and high color-rendition index lamps to approximate daylight color temperatures 
advantages  
luminous efficacy  
fluorescent lamps convert more of the input power to visible light than incandescent lamps  though as of 2013
are sometimes even more efficient and are more rapidly increasing in efficiency  a typical 100 watt tungsten filament incandescent lamp may convert only 5  of its power input to visible white light  400700nm wavelength   whereas typical fluorescent lamps convert about 22  of the power input to visible white light 
the efficacy of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 lumens per watt for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100
per watt with a modern electronic ballast  commonly averaging 50 to 67lm w overall  most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm w  lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation  for a given fluorescent tube  a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10  efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast  it is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the efficacy of a fluorescent lamp system  this can be about 25  of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts  and around 10  with electronic ballasts 
fluorescent lamp efficacy is dependent on lamp temperature at the coldest part of the lamp  in t8 lamps this is in the center of the tube  in
this is at the end of the tube with the text stamped on it  the ideal temperature for a t8 lamp is 25c  77f  while the t5 lamp is ideally at 35c  95f  
life  
typically a fluorescent lamp will last 10 to 20 times as long as an equivalent incandescent lamp when operated several hours at a time  under standard test conditions general lighting lamps have 9,000 hours or longer service life 
the higher initial cost of a fluorescent lamp compared with an incandescent lamp is usually more than compensated for by lower energy consumption over its life   
a few manufacturers are producing t8 lamps with 90,000 hour lamp lives  rivalling the life of led lamps   
lower luminance  
compared with an incandescent lamp  a fluorescent tube is a more diffuse and physically larger light source  in suitably designed lamps  light can be more evenly distributed without point source of glare such as seen from an undiffused incandescent filament  the lamp is large compared to the typical distance between lamp and illuminated surfaces 
lower heat  
fluorescent lamps give off about one-fifth the heat of equivalent incandescent lamps  this greatly reduces the size  cost  and energy consumption devoted to air conditioning for office buildings that would typically have many lights and few windows 
disadvantages  
this section needs additional citations for   please help
by   unsourced material may be challenged and removed   october 2011    
frequent switching  
if the lamp is installed where it is frequently switched on and off  it will age rapidly  under extreme conditions  its lifespan may be much shorter than a cheap incandescent lamp  each start cycle slightly erodes the electron-emitting surface of the cathodes  when all the emission material is gone  the lamp cannot start with the available ballast voltage  fixtures intended for flashing of lights  such as for advertising  will use a ballast that maintains cathode temperature when the arc is off  preserving the life of the lamp 
the extra energy used to start a fluorescent lamp is equivalent to a few seconds of normal operation  it is more energy-efficient to switch off lamps when not required for several minutes 
health and safety issues  
main article 
if a fluorescent lamp is broken  a very small amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment  about 99  of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor  especially on lamps that are near the end of their life  the broken glass is usually considered a greater hazard than the small amount of spilled mercury    the epa recommends airing out the location of a fluorescent tube break and using wet paper towels to help pick up the broken glass and fine particles  any glass and used towels should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag  vacuum cleaners can cause the particles to become airborne  and should not be used   
fluorescent lamps with magnetic
flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120hz and this flickering can cause problems for some individuals with   they are listed as problematic for some individuals with           and   newer fluorescent lights without magnetic ballasts have essentially eliminated flicker     
ultraviolet emission  
fluorescent lamps emit a small amount of
 uv  light  a 1993 study in the us found that ultraviolet exposure from sitting under fluorescent lights for eight hours is equivalent to one minute of sun exposure  ultraviolet radiation from compact fluorescent lamps may exacerbate symptoms in photosensitive individuals 
the ultraviolet light from a fluorescent lamp can degrade the pigments in paintings  especially watercolor pigments  and bleach the dyes used in
and some printing  valuable art work must be protected from ultraviolet light by placing additional glass or transparent
between the lamp and the art work   
ballast  
magnetic single-lamp ballasts have a low  
fluorescent lamps require a
to stabilize the current through the lamp  and to provide the initial striking voltage required to start the arc discharge  this increases the cost of fluorescent   though often one ballast is shared between two or more lamps  electromagnetic ballasts with a minor fault can produce an audible humming or buzzing noise  magnetic ballasts are usually filled with a -like potting compound to reduce emitted noise  hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency electronic ballast  energy lost in magnetic ballasts was around 10  of lamp input power according to ge literature from 1978  electronic ballasts reduce this loss 
power quality and radio interference  
simple inductive fluorescent lamp ballasts have a
of less than unity  inductive ballasts include power factor correction capacitors  simple electronic ballasts may also have low power factor due to their rectifier input stage 
fluorescent lamps are a non-linear load and generate harmonic currents in the electrical power supply  the arc within the lamp may generate radio frequency noise  which can be conducted through power wiring  suppression of radio interference is possible  very good suppression is possible  but adds to the cost of the fluorescent fixtures 
operating temperature  
fluorescent lamps operate best around room temperature  at much lower or higher temperatures 
decreases  at below-freezing temperatures standard lamps may not start  special lamps may be needed for reliable service outdoors in cold weather  in applications such as road and railway signalling  fluorescent lamps which do not generate as much heat as incandescent lamps may not melt snow and ice build up around the lamp  leading to reduced visibility   
lamp shape  
fluorescent tubes are long  low-luminance sources compared with high pressure arc lamps  incandescent lamps and leds  however  low luminous intensity of the emitting surface is useful because it reduces   lamp fixture design must control light from a long tube instead of a compact globe 
the
 cfl  replaces regular incandescent bulbs  however  some cfls will not fit some lamps  because the harp  heavy wire shade support bracket  is shaped for the narrow neck of an incandescent lamp  while cfls tend to have a wide housing for their electronic ballast close to the lamp s base 
flicker problems  
the  beat effect  problem created when shooting photos under standard fluorescent lighting
fluorescent lamps using a magnetic power line frequency ballast do not give out a steady light  instead  they flicker at twice the supply frequency  this results in fluctuations not only with light output but color temperature as well  which may pose problems for photography and people who are sensitive to the flicker  even among persons not sensitive to light flicker  a
can be noticed  where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp  this effect is eliminated by paired lamps operating on a lead-lag ballast  unlike a true strobe lamp  the light level drops in appreciable time and so substantial  blurring  of the moving part would be evident 
in some circumstances  fluorescent lamps operated at the power supply frequency  50 or 60hz  can also produce flicker at the same frequency itself  which is noticeable by more people  this can happen in the last few hours of tube life when the cathode emission coating at one end has almost run out  and that
starts having difficulty emitting enough
into the gas fill  resulting in slight
and hence uneven light output in positive and negative going ac cycles  power frequency flicker can also sometimes be emitted from the very ends of the tubes  if each tube electrode produces a slightly different light output pattern on each half-cycle  flicker at power frequency is more noticeable in the
than it is when viewed directly  as is all flicker  since the peripheral vision is fasterhas a higher critical frequencythan the central vision  
near the end of life  fluorescent lamps can start flickering at a frequency lower than the power frequency  this is due to a dynamic instability inherent in the negative resistance of the plasma source  which can be from a bad lamp  a bad ballast  or a bad starter  or occasionally from a poor connection to power 
the  beat effect  problem created when shooting films under standard fluorescent lighting
new fluorescent lamps may show a twisting spiral pattern of light in a part of the lamp  this effect is due to loose cathode material and usually disappears after a few hours of operation 
electromagnetic ballasts may also cause problems for video recording as there can be a so-called
effect between the periodic reading of a camera s sensor and the fluctuations in intensity of the fluorescent lamp 
fluorescent lamps using high-frequency electronic ballasts do not produce visible light flicker  since above about 5khz  the excited electron state half-life is longer than a half cycle    and light production becomes continuous  operating frequencies of electronic ballasts are selected to avoid interference with infrared remote controls  poor quality  or failing  electronic ballasts may have insufficient
or have poor regulation  thereby producing considerable 100/120hz modulation of the light 
dimming  
fluorescent light fixtures cannot be connected to
switches intended for incandescent lamps  two effects are responsible for this  the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts  and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels  dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast  these systems keep the cathodes of the fluorescent tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced  promoting easy
of electrons into the arc stream 
are available that work in conjunction with a suitable dimmer 
disposal and recycling  
main article 
the disposal of phosphor and particularly the toxic
in the tubes is an environmental issue  governmental regulations in many areas require special disposal of fluorescent lamps separate from general and household wastes  for large commercial or industrial users of fluorescent lights  recycling services are available in many nations  and may be required by regulation  in some areas  recycling is also available to consumers 
lamp sizes and designations  
main article 
systematic nomenclature identifies mass-market lamps as to general shape  power rating  length  color  and other electrical and illuminating characteristics 
other fluorescent lamps  
blacklights are a subset of fluorescent lamps that are used to provide near
light  at about 360nm wavelength   they are built in the same fashion as conventional fluorescent lamps but the glass tube is coated with a phosphor that converts the short-wave uv within the tube to long-wave uv rather than to visible light  they are used to provoke fluorescence  to provide dramatic effects using
and to detect materials such as urine and certain dyes that would be invisible in visible light  as well as to attract insects to  
so-called blacklite blue lamps are also made from more expensive deep purple glass known as
rather than clear glass  the deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge  producing proportionally less visible light compared with uv light  this allows uv-induced fluorescence to be seen more easily  thereby allowing
to seem much more dramatic   the blacklight lamps used in bug zappers do not require this refinement so it is usually omitted in the interest of cost  they are called simply
 and not blacklite blue  
the lamps used in
contain a different phosphor blend  typically 3 to 5 or more phosphors  that emits both uva and uvb  provoking a
response in most human skin  typically  the output is rated as 310  uvb  5  most typical  with the remaining uv as uva  these are mainly f71  f72  or f73 ho  100w  lamps  although 160w vho are somewhat common  one common phosphor used in these lamps is lead-activated barium disilicate  but a europium-activated strontium fluoroborate is also used  early lamps used
as an activator  but emissions of thallium during manufacture were toxic 
uvb medical lamps  
the lamps used in
contain a phosphor that emits only uvb ultraviolet light  there are two types  broadband uvb that gives 290320 nanometer with peak wavelength of 306nm  and narrowband uvb that gives 311313 nanometer  due to its longer wavelength the narrowband uvb requires a 10 times higher dose to the skin  compared to the broadband  the narrowband is good for psoriasis  eczema  atopic dermatitis   vitiligo  lichen planus  and some other skin diseases    the broadband is better for increasing vitamin d3 in the body 
grow lamps contain phosphor blends that encourage   growth  or flowering in plants  algae  photosynthetic bacteria  and other light-dependent organisms  these often emit light primarily in the red and blue color range  which is absorbed by
and used for photosynthesis in plants 
lamps
lamps can be made with a lithium metaluminate phosphor activated with iron  this phosphor has peak emissions between 675 and 875 nanometers  with lesser emissions in the deep red part of the visible spectrum 
bilirubin lamps
deep blue light generated from a -activated phosphor is used in the
treatment of   light of this color penetrates skin and helps in the breakup of excess  
-  similar structure but not fluorescent 
germicidal lamps depend on the property that spectrum of 254 nm kills most germs  germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all  making them mercury vapor gas discharge lamps rather than fluorescent  and their tubes are made of
that is transparent to the uv light emitted by the mercury discharge  the 254 nm uv emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize
to   in addition it can cause eye and skin damage and should not be used or observed without eye and skin protection  besides their uses to kill
and create ozone  they are sometimes used by
to identify certain species of
by the color of their fluorescence  when used in this fashion  they are fitted with filters in the same way as blacklight-blue lamps are  the filter passes the short-wave uv and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge  they are also used in some
erasers 
germicidal lamps have designations beginning with g  meaning germicidal   rather than f  for example g30t8 for a 30-watt  1-inch  2.5cm  diameter  36-inch  91cm  long germicidal lamp  as opposed to an f30t8  which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating  
electrodeless induction lamps are fluorescent lamps without internal electrodes  they have been commercially available since 1990  a current is induced into the gas column using   because the electrodes are usually the life-limiting element of fluorescent lamps  such electrodeless lamps can have a very long service life  although they also have a higher purchase price

science demonstrations  
capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity
