spent nuclear fuel stored underwater and uncapped at the

high-level radioactive waste management concerns how
materials created during production of
and
are dealt with  radioactive waste contains a mixture of short-lived and long-lived nuclides  as well as non-radioactive nuclides  there was reported some 47,000 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste stored in the usa in 2002 
the most troublesome
in spent fuel are
 half-life two million years  and
 half-life 24,000 years   consequently  high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the   this usually necessitates treatment  followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage  disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form 
follows the
rule  which means that the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay  in other words  the radiation from a long-lived
like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of short-lived isotope like  
governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options  usually involving   although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions  this is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years  according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses 
thus  alfvn identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste   1  stable geological formations  and  2  stable human institutions over hundreds of thousands of years  as alfvn suggests  no known human civilization has ever endured for so long  and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period  nevertheless  avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude  radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns  examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity  consideration of  the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations  
there is a debate over what should constitute an acceptable scientific and engineering foundation for proceeding with radioactive waste disposal strategies  there are those who have argued  on the basis of complex geochemical simulation models  that relinquishing control over radioactive materials to geohydrologic processes at repository closure is an acceptable risk  they maintain that so-called  natural analogues  inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides  making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary  however  existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined  due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations  the accuracy of computer simulation models has not been verified by empirical observation  certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half-lives of high-level radioactive waste  on the other hand  some insist deep geologic repositories in stable geologic formations are necessary  national management plans of various countries display a variety of approaches to resolving this debate 
researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such long periods should be examined critically  practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned  long term behaviour of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research  management strategies and implementation plans of several representative national governments are described below

geologic disposal  
the
has said 
it is widely accepted that spent nuclear fuel and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years  to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment  safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use  there is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface 
the process of selecting appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017  the basic concept is to locate a large  stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel  or large-bore
 similar to those used to drill the
from england to france  to drill a shaft 5001,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste  the goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment  however  many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate
of this disposal system  suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent 
because some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years  even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account  moreover  it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to no longer be lethal to living organisms  a 1983 review of the swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the national academy of sciences found that countrys estimate of several hundred thousand yearsperhaps up to one million yearsbeing necessary for waste isolation  fully justified  
the proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land  and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement  this method has been described as a viable means of disposing of radioactive waste  and as a state-of-the-art nuclear waste disposal technology 
in nature  sixteen repositories were discovered at the
mine in
where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago  the fission products in these natural formations were found to have moved less than 10ft  3 m  over this period  though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the
structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water  uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in
because of a less complete nuclear reaction  so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack 
materials for geological disposal  
in order to store the high level radioactive waste in long-term geological depositories  specific waste forms need to be used which will allow the radioactivity to decay away while the materials retain their integrity for thousands of years  the materials being used can be broken down into a few classes  glass waste forms  ceramic waste forms  and nanostructured materials 
the
include borosilicate glasses and phosphate glasses  borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste in many countries which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry  the glass waste forms have the advantage of being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions  they are easy to scale up to industrial processing  and they are stable against thermal  radiative  and chemical perturbations  these glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements  phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses  which make them a more favorable option  however  no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions  both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements 
the
forms offer higher waste loadings than the glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure  also  mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms provide evidence for long term durability  due to this fact and the fact that they can be processed at lower temperatures  ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms  ceramic waste forms offer great potential  but a lot of research remains to be done 
national management plans  
finland  the united states and sweden are the most advanced in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal  countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing  with france and japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing  the country-specific status of high-level waste management plans are described below 
in many european countries  e g   britain  finland  the netherlands  sweden and switzerland  the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the international commission on radiation protection or proposed in the united states  european limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the international commission on radiation protection by a factor of 20  and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the u s  environmental protection agency  epa  for
for the first 10,000 years after closure  moreover  the u s  epas proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the european limit 
the countries that have made the most progress towards a repository for high-level radioactive waste have typically started with
and made voluntary siting a necessary condition  this consensus seeking approach is believed to have a greater chance of success than top-down modes of decision making  but the process is necessarily slow  and there is  inadequate experience around the world to know if it will succeed in all existing and aspiring nuclear nations  
moreover 
a nuclear waste repository as they are  concerned about their community becoming a de facto site for waste for thousands of years  the health and environmental consequences of an accident  and lower property values  
asia  
people s republic of china  
in the peoples republic of china  ten reactors provide about 2  of electricity and five more are under construction  china made a commitment to reprocessing in the 1980s  a pilot plant is under construction at   where a temporary spent fuel storage facility has been constructed  geological disposal has been studied since 1985  and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003  sites in
province near the
desert in northwestern china are under investigation  with a final site expected to be selected by 2020  and actual disposal by about 2050 
republic of china  
in the  
was built at the southern tip of
in   offshore of taiwan island  the facility was built in 1982 and it is owned and operated by   the facility receives
from taipower s current three   however  due to the strong resistance from local community in the island  the nuclear waste has to be stored at the power plant facilities themselves 
india  
sixteen nuclear reactors produce about 3  of indias electricity  and seven more are under construction  spent fuel is processed at facilities in
near   at
on the west coast north of mumbai  and at
on the southeast coast of india  plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor  under construction  to produce more fuel  and other waste vitrified at tarapur and trombay  interim storage for 30 years is expected  with eventual disposal in a
in crystalline rock near kalpakkam 
japan  
in 2000  a specified radioactive waste final disposal act called for creation of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste  and later that year the nuclear waste management organization of japan  numo  was established under the jurisdiction of the ministry of economy  trade and industry  numo is responsible for selecting a permanent
site  construction  operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040  site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities  but by 2006  no local government had volunteered to host the facility 
showed interest in 2007  but its mayor resigned due to local opposition  in december 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities 
the head of the s expert panel has said japan s seismic conditions makes it difficult to predict ground conditions over the necessary 100,000 years  so it will be impossible to convince the public of the safety of deep geological disposal 
europe  
belgium  
belgium has seven nuclear reactors that provide about 52  of its electricity  belgian spent nuclear fuel was initially sent for reprocessing in france  in 1993  reprocessing was suspended following a resolution of the belgian parliament  spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants  the deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste  hlw  has been studied in belgium for more than 30 years  boom clay is studied as a reference host formation for hlw disposal  the hades underground research laboratory  url  is located at 223 m in the boom formation at the
site  the belgian url is operated by the euridice   a joint organisation between   the belgian nuclear research centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and   the belgian agency for radioactive waste management  in belgium  the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the federal agency of nuclear control  created in 2001 
finland  
in 1983  the government decided to select a site for permanent repository by 2010  with four nuclear reactors providing 29  of its electricity  finland in 1987 enacted a nuclear energy act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal  subject to requirements of its
and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located  producers of nuclear waste organized the company   with responsibility for site selection  construction and operation of a permanent repository  a 1994 amendment to the act required final disposal of spent fuel in finland  prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste 
environmental assessment of four sites occurred in 199798  posiva chose the
site near two existing reactors  and the local government approved it in 2000  the finnish parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock at a depth of about 500 meters in 2001  the repository concept is similar to the swedish model  with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020  an underground characterization facility    was under construction at the site in 2012 
france  
with 58 nuclear reactors contributing about 75  of its electricity  the highest percentage of any country  france has been reprocessing its spent reactor fuel since the introduction of nuclear power there  some reprocessed plutonium is used to make fuel  but more is being produced than is being recycled as reactor fuel  france also reprocesses spent fuel for other countries  but the nuclear waste is returned to the country of origin  radioactive waste from reprocessing french spent fuel is expected to be disposed of in a geological repository  pursuant to legislation enacted in 1991 that established a 15-year period for conducting radioactive waste management research  under this legislation  partition and transmutation of long-lived elements  immobilization and conditioning processes  and long-term near surface storage are being investigated by the commissariat  lenergie atomique  cea   disposal in deep geological formations is being studied by the french agency for radioactive waste management  l agence nationale pour la gestion des dchets radioactifs  in underground research labs 
three sites were identified for possible deep geologic disposal in clay near the border of
and   near   and at   in 1998 the government approved the   a site near meuse haute-marne and dropped the others from further consideration  legislation was proposed in 2006 to license a repository by 2015  with operations expected in 2025 
germany  
nuclear waste policy in germany is in flux  german planning for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974  focused on   a salt mine near gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of braunschweig  the site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant  spent fuel management  and permanent disposal facilities at a single site  plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979  in 2000  the federal government and utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years  and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power  closing one reactor in 2003 
within days of the march 2011   chancellor
 imposed a three-month moratorium on previously announced extensions for germany s existing nuclear power plants  while shutting seven of the 17 reactors that had been operating since 1981   protests continued and  on 29 may 2011  merkel s government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022 
meanwhile  electric utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim storage facilities at gorleben  lubmin and ahaus until temporary storage facilities can be built near reactor sites  previously  spent fuel was sent to france or the united kingdom for reprocessing  but this practice was ended in july 2005 
russia  
in russia  the ministry of atomic energy    is responsible for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16  of its electricity  minatom is also responsible for reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal  including over 25,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in temporary storage in 2001 
russia has a long history of reprocessing spent fuel for military purposes  and previously planned to reprocess imported spent fuel  possibly including some of the 33,000 metric tons of spent fuel accumulated at sites in other countries who received fuel from the u s   which the u s  originally pledged to take back  such as brazil  the czech republic  india  japan  mexico  slovenia  south korea  switzerland  taiwan  and the european union 
an environmental protection act in 1991 prohibited importing radioactive material for long-term storage or burial in russia  but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage was passed by the russian parliament and signed by president putin in 2001  in the long term  the russian plan is for deep geologic disposal  most attention has been paid to locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at mayak  near chelyabinsk in the ural mountains  and in granite at krasnoyarsk in siberia 
sweden  
in   as of 2007 there are ten operating nuclear reactors that produce about 45  of its electricity  two other reactors in
were shut down in 1999 and 2005  when these reactors were built  it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country  and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to sweden  later  construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated  but has not been built 
passage of the stipulation act of 1977 transferred responsibility for nuclear waste management from the government to the nuclear industry  requiring reactor operators to present an acceptable plan for waste management with  absolute safety  in order to obtain an operating license  in early 1980  after the
meltdown in the united states  a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in sweden  in late 1980  after a three-question referendum produced mixed results  the swedish parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010    in 2010  the swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors  the new units can only be built at the existing nuclear power sites  oskarshamn  ringhals or forsmark  and only to replace one of the existing reactors  that will have to be shut down for the new one to be able to start up 
the    svensk krnbrnslehantering ab  known as skb  was created in 1980 and is responsible for final disposal of nuclear waste there  this includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility  the central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel at   about 150 miles south of stockholm on the baltic coast  transportation of spent fuel  and construction of a permanent repository  swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at oskarshamn  where it will be stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository 
conceptual design of a permanent repository was determined by 1983  calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground  below the water table in what is known as the
method  space around the canisters will be filled with
clay  after examining six possible locations for a permanent repository  three were nominated for further investigation  at   oskarshamn  and   on 3 june 2009  swedish nuclear fuel and waste co  chose a location for a deep-level waste site at sthammar  near forsmark nuclear power plant  the application to build the repository was handed in by skb 2011   
switzerland  
switzerland has five nuclear reactors that provide about 43  of its electricity  some swiss spent nuclear fuel has been sent for reprocessing in france and the united kingdom  most fuel is being stored without reprocessing  an industry-owned organization  zwilag  built and operates a central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste  and for conditioning low-level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes  other interim storage facilities predating zwilag continue to operate in switzerland 
the swiss program is considering options for the siting of a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal  and for low   intermediate level wastes  construction of a repository is not foreseen until well into this century  research on sedimentary rock  especially opalinus clay  is carried out at the swiss   the grimsel test site  an older facility in crystalline rock is also still active 
united kingdom  
great britain has 19 operating reactors  producing about 20  of its electricity  it processes much of its spent fuel at
on the northwest coast across from ireland  where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal  sellafield has a history of environmental and safety problems  including a fire in a nuclear plant in   and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant  thorp  
in 1982 the nuclear industry radioactive waste management executive  nirex  was established with responsibility for disposing of long-lived nuclear waste and in 2006 a committee on radioactive waste management  corwm  of the department of environment  food and rural affairs recommended geologic disposal 2001,000 meters underground  nirex developed a generic repository concept based on the swedish model but has not yet selected a site  a nuclear decommissioning authority is responsible for packaging waste from reprocessing and will eventually relieve british nuclear fuels ltd  of responsibility for power reactors and the sellafield reprocessing plant 
north america  
canada  
the 18 operating nuclear power plants in canada generated about 16  of its electricity in 2006  a national nuclear fuel waste act was enacted by the canadian parliament in 2002  requiring nuclear energy corporations to create a waste management organization to propose to the government of canada approaches for management of nuclear waste  and implementation of an approach subsequently selected by the government  the act defined management as  long term management by means of storage or disposal  including handling  treatment  conditioning or transport for the purpose of storage or disposal  
the resulting  nwmo  conducted an extensive three-year study and consultation with canadians  in 2005  they recommended adaptive phased management  an approach that emphasized both technical and management methods  the technical method included centralized isolation and containment of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository in a suitable rock formation  such as the granite of the canadian shield or ordovician sedimentary rocks  also recommended was a phased decision making process supported by a program of continuous learning  research and development 
in 2007  the canadian government accepted this recommendation  and nwmo was tasked with implementing the recommendation  no specific timeframe was defined for the process  in 2009  the nwmo was designing the process for site selection  siting was expected to take 10 years or more 
united states  
the
of 1982 established a timetable and procedure for constructing a permanent  underground repository for high-level radioactive waste by the mid-1990s  and provided for some temporary storage of waste  including spent fuel from 104 civilian nuclear reactors that produce about 19.4  of electricity there  the united states in april 2008 had about 56,000 metric tons of spent fuel and 20,000 canisters of solid defense-related waste  and this is expected to increase to 119,000 metric tons by 2035  the u s  opted for yucca mountain nuclear waste repository  a final repository at
in nevada  but this project was widely opposed  with some of the main concerns being long distance transportation of waste from across the united states to this site  the possibility of accidents  and the uncertainty of success in isolating nuclear waste from the human environment in perpetuity  yucca mountain  with capacity for 70,000 metric tons of radioactive waste  was expected to open in 2017  however  the
rejected use of the site in the 2009
proposal  which eliminated all funding except that needed to answer inquiries from the nuclear regulatory commission   while the administration devises a new strategy toward nuclear waste disposal   on march 5  2009 
told a senate hearing  the yucca mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste   starting in 1999  military-generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the
in new mexico 
in a presidential memorandum dated january 29  2010  president obama established the
 the commission   the commission  composed of fifteen members  conducted an extensive two-year study of nuclear waste disposal  what is referred to as the  back end  of the nuclear energy process  the commission established three subcommittees  reactor and fuel cycle technology  transportation and storage  and disposal  on january 26  2012  the commission submitted its final report to energy secretary steven chu  in the disposal subcommittees final report the commission does not issue recommendations for a specific site but rather presents a comprehensive recommendation for disposal strategies  during their research the commission visited finland  france  japan  russia  sweden  and the uk  in their final report the commission put forth seven recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue 
recommendation  1
the united states should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste 
recommendation  2
a new  single-purpose organization is needed to develop and implement a focused  integrated program for the transportation  storage  and disposal 1 of nuclear waste in the united states 
recommendation  3
assured access to the balance in the nuclear waste fund  nwf  and to the revenues generated by annual nuclear waste fee payments from utility ratepayers is absolutely essential and must be provided to the new nuclear waste management organization 
recommendation  4
a new approach is needed to site and develop nuclear waste facilities in the united states in the future  we believe that these processes are most likely to succeed if they are 
adaptivein the sense that process itself is flexible and produces decisions that are responsive to new information and new technical  social  or political developments 
stagedin the sense that key decisions are revisited and modified as necessary along the way rather than being pre-determined in advance 
consent-basedin the sense that affected communities have an opportunity to decide whether to accept facility siting decisions and retain significant local control 
transparentin the sense that all stakeholders have an opportunity to understand key decisions and engage in the process in a meaningful way 
standards- and science-basedin the sense that the public can have confidence that all facilities meet rigorous  objective  and consistently-applied standards of safety and environmental protection 
governed by partnership arrangements or legally-enforceable agreements with host states  tribes and local communities 
recommendation  5
the current division of regulatory responsibilities for long-term repository performance between the nrc and the epa is appropriate and should continue  the two agencies should develop new  site-independent safety standards in a formally coordinated joint process that actively engages and solicits input from all the relevant constituencies 
recommendation  6
the roles  responsibilities  and authorities of local  state  and tribal governments  with respect to facility siting and other aspects of nuclear waste disposal  must be an element of the negotiation between the federal government and the other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility  in addition to legally-binding agreements  as discussed in recommendation  4  all affected levels of government  local  state  tribal  etc   must have  at a minimum  a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions  additionally  states and tribes should retainor where appropriate  be delegateddirect authority over aspects of regulation  permitting  and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens 
recommendation  7
the nuclear waste technical review board  nwtrb  should be retained as a valuable source of independent technical advice and review 
international repository  
although australia does not have any nuclear power reactors 
considered siting an international repository in the outback of south australia or western australia in 1998  but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the
during the following year  thereafter  pangea ceased operations in australia but reemerged as pangea international association  and in 2002 evolved into the association for regional and international underground storage with support from belgium  bulgaria  hungary  japan and switzerland  a general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures  russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries  but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries  south africa  argentina and western china have also been mentioned as possible locations 
in the eu  covra is negotiating a european-wide waste disposal system with single disposal sites that can be used by several eu-countries  this eu-wide storage possibility is being researched under the sapierr-2 program
