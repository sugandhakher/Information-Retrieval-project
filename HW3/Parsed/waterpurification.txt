water purification is the process of removing undesirable chemicals  biological contaminants  suspended solids and gases from contaminated water  the goal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose  most water is disinfected for human consumption     but water purification may also be designed for a variety of other purposes  including fulfilling the requirements of medical  pharmacological  chemical and industrial applications  the methods used include physical processes such as     and   biological processes such as
or   chemical processes such as
and
and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as  
purifying water may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including
            as well as reducing the amount of a range of dissolved and particulate material derived from the surfaces that come from runoff due to  
the standards for drinking
are typically set by governments or by international standards  these standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants  depending on the intended purpose of water use 
visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality  simple procedures such as
or the use of a household
filter are not sufficient for treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source  even natural
 considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century  must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment  if any  is needed 
and   while expensive  are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification

  the water emerging from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens  hundreds  or thousands of years ago 
and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to a high degree of clarity and often  it does not require additional treatment besides adding
or
as secondary disinfectants  such water may emerge as springs    or may be extracted from boreholes or wells  deep ground water is generally of very high
quality  i e   pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent   but the water may be rich in dissolved solids  especially
and
of
and   depending on the
through which the water has flowed  other ions may also be present including   and   there may be a requirement to reduce the
or
content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking  cooking  and laundry use  primary
may also be required  where groundwater recharge is practised  a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought   the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations 
upland
and   typically located in the headwaters of river systems  upland reservoirs are usually sited above any human habitation and may be surrounded by a protective zone to restrict the opportunities for contamination  bacteria and pathogen levels are usually low  but some bacteria 
or
will be present  where uplands are forested or peaty 
can colour the water  many upland sources have low
which require adjustment 
 
and low land reservoirs  low land surface waters will have a significant bacterial load and may also contain algae  suspended solids and a variety of dissolved constituents 
is a new technology that can provide high quality drinking water by extracting water from the air by cooling the air and thus condensing water vapor 
or
which collect water from the atmosphere can be used especially in areas with significant dry seasons and in areas which experience fog even when there is little rain 
of
by
or  
  freshwater bodies that are open to the atmosphere and are not designated as groundwater are termed surface waters 
treatment  
aims  
the aims of the treatment are to remove unwanted constituents in the water and to make it safe to drink or fit for a specific purpose in industry or medical applications  widely varied techniques are available to remove contaminants like fine solids  micro-organisms and some dissolved inorganic and organic materials  or   the choice of method will depend on the quality of the water being treated  the cost of the treatment process and the quality standards expected of the processed water 
the processes below are the ones commonly used in water purification plants  some or most may not be used depending on the scale of the plant and quality of the raw  source  water 
pretreatment  
pumping and containment  the majority of water must be pumped from its source or directed into pipes or holding tanks  to avoid adding contaminants to the water  this physical infrastructure must be made from appropriate materials and constructed so that accidental contamination does not occur 
screening  see also    the first step in purifying surface water is to remove large debris such as sticks  leaves  rubbish and other large particles which may interfere with subsequent purification steps  most deep groundwater does not need screening before other purification steps 
storage  water from rivers may also be stored in
for periods between a few days and many months to allow natural biological purification to take place  this is especially important if treatment is by   storage reservoirs also provide a buffer against short periods of drought or to allow water supply to be maintained during transitory
incidents in the source river 
pre-chlorination  in many plants the incoming water was chlorinated to minimize the growth of fouling organisms on the pipe-work and tanks  because of the potential adverse quality effects  see chlorine below   this has largely been discontinued 
ph adjustment  
pure water has a
close to 7  neither
nor   
can have ph values that range from 7.5 to 8.4  moderately alkaline   fresh water can have widely ranging ph values depending on the geology of the
or
and the influence of contaminant inputs     if the water is acidic  lower than 7       or
can be added to raise the ph during water purification processes  lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration  thus raising the water hardness  for highly acidic waters  forced draft
can be an effective way to raise the ph  by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water  making the water alkaline helps
and
processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of
being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead
in pipe fittings  sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes  acid   
or   may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the ph  alkaline water  above ph 7.0  does not necessarily mean that lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water  the ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of ph  mineral content  temperature  alkalinity and calcium concentration 
coagulation and flocculation  
see also 
one of the first steps in a conventional water purification process is the addition of chemicals to assist in the removal of particles suspended in water  particles can be inorganic such as
and
or organic such as      
and   inorganic and organic particles contribute to the
and color of water 
the addition of inorganic coagulants such as
 or   or iron  iii  salts such as
cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on and among the particles  within seconds  negative charges on the particles are neutralized by inorganic coagulants  also within seconds  metal hydroxide precipitates of the aluminum and iron  iii  ions begin to form  these precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as
and through induced mixing which is sometimes referred to as   the term most often used for the amorphous metal hydroxides is  floc   large  amorphous aluminum and iron  iii  hydroxides adsorb and enmesh particles in suspension and facilitate the removal of particles by subsequent processes of
and   8.28.3
aluminum hydroxides are formed within a fairly narrow ph range  typically  5.5 to about 7.7  iron  iii  hydroxides can form over a larger ph range including ph levels lower than are effective for alum  typically  5.0 to 8.5  679
in the literature  there is much debate and confusion over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculationwhere does coagulation end and flocculation begin  in water purification plants  there is usually a high energy  rapid mix unit process  detention time in seconds  where the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins  detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes  where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc  in fact  coagulation and flocculation processes are ongoing once the metal salt coagulants are added  745
organic polymers were developed in the 1960s as aids to coagulants and  in some cases  as replacements for the inorganic metal salt coagulants  synthetic organic polymers are high molecular weight compounds that carry negative  positive or neutral charges  when organic polymers are added to water with particulates  the high molecular weight compounds adsorb onto particle surfaces and through interparticle bridging coalesce with other particles to form floc 
is a popular cationic  positively charged  organic polymer used in water purification plants  6678
sedimentation  
waters exiting the flocculation basin may enter the   also called a clarifier or settling basin  it is a large tank with low water velocities  allowing floc to settle to the bottom  the sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up  sedimentation basins may be rectangular  where water flows from end to end  or circular where flow is from the centre outward  sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of waterthat furthest from the sludgeexits 
in 1904 
showed that the efficiency of a sedimentation process was a function of the particle settling velocity  the flow through the tank and the surface area of tank  sedimentation tanks are typically designed within a range of overflow rates of 0.5 to 1.0 gallons per minute per square foot  or 1.25 to 2.5 meters per hour   in general  sedimentation basin efficiency is not a function of detention time or depth of the basin  although  basin depth must be sufficient so that water currents do not disturb the sludge and settled particle interactions are promoted  as particle concentrations in the settled water increase near the sludge surface on the bottom of the tank  settling velocities can increase due to collisions and agglomeration of particles  typical detention times for sedimentation vary from 1.5 to 4 hours and basin depths vary from 10 to 15 feet  3 to 4.5 meters   9.399.40 7901 1402  171
inclined flat plates or tubes can be added to traditional sedimentation basins to improve particle removal performance  inclined plates and tubes drastically increase the surface area available for particles to be removed in concert with hazen s original theory  the amount of ground surface area occupied by a sedimentation basin with inclined plates or tubes can be far smaller than a conventional sedimentation basin 
sludge storage and removal  
as particles settle to the bottom of a sedimentation basin  a layer of
is formed on the floor of the tank which must be removed and treated  the amount of sludge generated is significant  often 3 to 5 percent of the total volume of water to be treated  the cost of treating and disposing of the sludge can impact the operating cost of a water treatment plant  the sedimentation basin may be equipped with mechanical cleaning devices that continually clean its bottom  or the basin can be periodically taken out of service and cleaned manually 
floc blanket clarifiers  
a subcategory of sedimentation is the removal of particulates by entrapment in a layer of suspended floc as the water is forced upward  the major advantage of floc blanket clarifiers is that they occupy a smaller footprint than conventional sedimentation  disadvantages are that particle removal efficiency can be highly variable depending on changes in influent water quality and influent water flow rate  8356
dissolved air flotation  
when particles to be removed do not settle out of solution easily  dissolved air flotation  daf  is often used  water supplies that are particularly vulnerable to unicellular algae blooms and supplies with low turbidity and high colour often employ daf  after coagulation and flocculation processes  water flows to daf tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc  the floating floc blanket is removed from the surface and clarified water is withdrawn from the bottom of the daf tank  9.46
filtration  
after separating most floc  the water is filtered as the final step to remove remaining suspended particles and unsettled floc 
rapid sand filters  
cutaway view of a typical rapid sand filter
the most common type of filter is a   water moves vertically through sand which often has a layer of
or
above the sand  the top layer removes organic compounds  which contribute to taste and odour  the space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles  so simple filtration is not enough  most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles  effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter  this property of the filter is key to its operation  if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles  the filter would quickly clog 
to clean the filter  water is passed quickly upward through the filter  opposite the normal direction  called backflushing or   to remove embedded particles  prior to this step  compressed air may be blown up through the bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process  this is known as air scouring  this contaminated water can be disposed of  along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin  or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water 
some water treatment plants employ pressure filters  these work on the same principle as rapid gravity filters  differing in that the filter medium is enclosed in a steel vessel and the water is forced through it under pressure 
advantages 
filters out much smaller particles than paper and sand filters can 
filters out virtually all particles larger than their specified pore sizes 
they are quite thin and so liquids flow through them fairly rapidly 
they are reasonably strong and so can withstand pressure differences across them of typically 25 atmospheres 
they can be cleaned  back flushed  and reused 
slow sand filters  
slow  artificial  filtration  a variation of   to the ground  water purification plant kran  czech republic
a profile of layers of gravel  sand and fine sand used in a slow sand filter plant 
may be used where there is sufficient land and space  as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters  these filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration  the filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand  with the coarsest sand  along with some gravel  at the bottom and finest sand at the top  drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection  filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer  called the zoogleal layer or   on the surface of the filter  an effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve  very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels  thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products  slow sand filters are not backwashed  they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth   
a specific  large-scale  form of slow sand filter is the process of   in which natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide a first stage of contaminant filtration  while typically not clean enough to be used directly for drinking water  the water gained from the associated extraction wells is much less problematic than river water taken directly from the major streams where bank filtration is often used   
membrane filtration  
are widely used for filtering both drinking water and   for drinking water  membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2mincluding
and   membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry  for limited domestic purposes  or before discharging the water into a river that is used by towns further downstream  they are widely used in industry  particularly for beverage preparation  including    however no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as  
and
ions 
removal of ions and other dissolved substances  
use polymer membranes with chemically formed microscopic pores that can be used to filter out dissolved substances avoiding the use of coagulants  the type of membrane media determines how much pressure is needed to drive the water through and what sizes of micro-organisms can be filtered out 
  ion exchange systems use - or -packed columns to replace unwanted ions  the most common case is
consisting of removal of
and
replacing them with benign  soap friendly 
or
ions  ion exchange resins are also used to remove toxic ions such as      
and many others 
  13.1213.58 water rich in
  and
ions  is treated with lime    and or soda-ash    to precipitate
out of solution utilizing the  
  water is passed between a positive
and a negative electrode  ion exchange
allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode  high purity deionized water is produced continuously  similar to ion exchange treatment  complete removal of ions from water is possible if the right conditions are met  the water is normally pre-treated with a
unit to remove non-ionic   and with gas transfer membranes to remove   a water recovery of 99  is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the ro inlet 
disinfection  
pumps used to add required amount of chemicals to the clear water at the water purification plant before the distribution  from left to right  sodium hypochlorite for disinfection  zinc orthophosphate as a corrosion inhibitor  sodium hydroxide for ph adjustment  and fluoride for tooth decay prevention 
disinfection is accomplished both by filtering out harmful micro-organisms and also by adding disinfectant chemicals  water is disinfected to kill any
which pass through the filters and to provide a residual dose of disinfectant to kill or inactivate potentially harmful micro-organisms in the storage and distribution systems  possible pathogens include     including    
and   and   including
and other   following the introduction of any chemical disinfecting agent  the water is usually held in temporary storage  often called a contact tank or clear well to allow the disinfecting action to complete 
chlorine disinfection  
main article 
the most common disinfection method involves some form of
or its compounds such as
or   chlorine is a strong
that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms  because chlorine is a toxic gas  there is a danger of a release associated with its use  this problem is avoided by the use of   which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water  chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions  a solid form    releases chlorine on contact with water  handling the solid  however  requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated  the generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine 
all forms of chlorine are widely used  despite their respective drawbacks  one drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by-products  these by-products 
 thms  and
 haas   are both
in large quantities and are regulated by the
 epa  and the
in the uk  the formation of thms and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition  although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria  it has limited effectiveness against protozoa that form cysts in water   and   both of which are pathogenic  
chlorine dioxide disinfection  
is a faster-acting disinfectant than elemental chlorine  it is relatively rarely used  because in some circumstances it may create excessive amounts of   which is a by-product regulated to low allowable levels in the united states  chlorine dioxide can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems  chlorine dioxide gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate 
chloramine disinfection  
the use of chloramine is becoming more common as a disinfectant  although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant  it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine and it will not readily form thms or haloacetic acids  it is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding
to the water after addition of chlorine  the chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine  water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience   as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth  with nitrates being generated as a by-product 
ozone disinfection  
is an unstable molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms  it is a very strong  broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in europe  it is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts  it also works well against almost all other pathogens  ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a  cold  electrical discharge  to use ozone as a disinfectant  it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact  some of the advantages of ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems  in comparison to    another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water  ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in   france  the
has accepted ozone as being safe  and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment  storage  and processing of foods  however  although fewer by-products are formed by ozonation  it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen   bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce  after ozonation  more than 10 parts per billion  ppb  of bromate  the maximum contaminant level established by the usepa 
ultraviolet disinfection  
main article 
 uv  is very effective at inactivating cysts  in low turbidity water  uv light s disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases  a result of the     and shadowing caused by the suspended solids  the main disadvantage to the use of uv radiation is that  like ozone treatment  it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water  therefore  it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process  this is often done through the addition of chloramines  discussed above as a primary disinfectant  when used in this manner  chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination 
portable water purification  
main article 
portable water purification devices and methods are available for disinfection and treatment in emergencies or in remote locations  disinfection is the primary goal  since aesthetic considerations such as taste  odor  appearance  and trace chemical contamination do not affect the short-term safety of drinking water 
additional treatment options  
  in many areas
is added to water with the goal of preventing   fluoride is usually added after the disinfection process  in the u s   fluoridation is usually accomplished by the addition of   which decomposes in water  yielding fluoride ions 
water conditioning  this is a method of reducing the effects of hard water  in water systems subject to heating hardness salts can be deposited as the decomposition of bicarbonate ions creates carbonate ions that precipitate out of solution  water with high concentrations of hardness salts can be treated with soda ash  sodium carbonate  which precipitates out the excess salts  through the   producing calcium carbonate of very high purity  the precipitated calcium carbonate is traditionally sold to the manufacturers of   several other methods of industrial and residential water treatment are claimed  without general scientific acceptance  to include the use of magnetic and or electrical fields reducing the effects of hard water   
reduction  in areas with naturally acidic waters of low conductivity  i e  surface rainfall in upland mountains of
rocks   the water may be capable of dissolving
from any lead pipes that it is carried in  the addition of small quantities of
ion and increasing the
slightly both assist in greatly reducing plumbo-solvency by creating insoluble lead salts on the inner surfaces of the pipes 
radium removal  some groundwater sources contain   a radioactive chemical element  typical sources include many groundwater sources north of the
in   radium can be removed by ion exchange  or by water conditioning  the back flush or sludge that is produced is  however  a low-level  
fluoride removal  although fluoride is added to water in many areas  some areas of the world have excessive levels of natural fluoride in the source water  excessive levels can be
or cause undesirable cosmetic effects such as staining of teeth  methods of reducing fluoride levels is through treatment with
and
filter media 
other water purification techniques  
other popular methods for purifying water  especially for local private supplies are listed below  in some countries some of these methods are also used for large scale municipal supplies  particularly important are distillation  de-salination of seawater  and reverse osmosis 
  bringing it to its
at 100c  212f   is the oldest and most effective way since it eliminates most
causing
related diseases  but it cannot remove
or impurities  for human health  complete
of water is not required  since the heat resistant microbes are not intestine affecting  the traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for additional safety  since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures greater than 60c  140f   though the
with increasing altitude  it is not enough to affect the disinfecting process  in areas where the water is  hard   that is  containing significant dissolved calcium salts   boiling decomposes the
ions  resulting in partial precipitation as   this is the  fur  that builds up on kettle elements  etc   in hard water areas  with the exception of calcium  boiling does not remove solutes of higher boiling point than water and in fact increases their concentration  due to some water being lost as vapour   boiling does not leave a residual disinfectant in the water  therefore  water that is boiled and then stored for any length of time may acquire new pathogens 
granular activated carbon filtering  a form of
with a high surface area  adsorbs many compounds including many toxic compounds  water passing through
is commonly used in municipal regions with organic contamination  taste or odors  many household water filters and fish tanks use activated carbon filters to further purify the water  household filters for drinking water sometimes contain
as metallic silver nanoparticle  if water is held in the carbon block for longer period  microorganisms can grow inside which results in fouling and contamination  silver nanoparticles are excellent anti-bacterial material and they can decompose toxic halo-organic compounds such as pesticides into non-toxic organic products 
involves boiling the water to produce water   the vapour contacts a cool surface where it condenses as a liquid  because the solutes are not normally vaporised  they remain in the boiling solution  even distillation does not completely purify water  because of contaminants with similar boiling points and droplets of unvapourised liquid carried with the steam  however  99.9  pure water can be obtained by distillation 
  mechanical pressure is applied to an impure solution to force pure water through a   reverse osmosis is theoretically the most thorough method of large scale water purification available  although perfect semi-permeable membranes are difficult to create  unless membranes are well-maintained 
and other life forms can colonize the membranes 
the use of iron in removing arsenic from water  see  
direct contact membrane distillation  dcmd   applicable to desalination  heated seawater is passed along the surface of a
membrane  evaporated water passes from the hot side through pores in the membrane into a stream of cold pure water on the other side  the difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through 
 is a process by which saline water  generally sea water  is converted to fresh water  the most common desalination processes are distillation and reverse osmosis  desalination is currently expensive compared to most alternative sources of water  and only a very small fraction of total human use is satisfied by desalination  it is only economically practical for high-valued uses  such as household and industrial uses  in arid areas 
gas hydrate crystals centrifuge method  if carbon dioxide or other low molecular weight gas is mixed with contaminated water at high pressure and low temperature  gas hydrate crystals will form exothermically  separation of the crystalline hydrate may be performed by centrifuge or sedimentation and decanting  water can be released from the hydrate crystals by heating
  a form of advanced oxidation processes and advanced oxidation technology  is an environmental remediation technique used for soil and or groundwater remediation to reduce the concentrations of targeted environmental contaminants to acceptable levels  isco is accomplished by injecting or otherwise introducing strong chemical oxidizers directly into the contaminated medium  soil or groundwater  to destroy chemical contaminants in place  it can be used to remediate a variety of organic compounds  including some that are resistant to natural degradation

demineralized water  
distillation removes all minerals from water  and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals  this results in demineralized water which is not considered ideal   the world health organization has investigated the health effects of demineralized water since 1980  experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased
and the elimination of   with decreased
concentration      and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency  demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium  which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium  low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants  when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water  recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10  with 2030mg l optimum  for calcium a 20mg l minimum and a 4080mg l optimum  and a total
 adding magnesium and calcium  of 2 to 4 l  at water hardness above 5mmol l  higher incidence of gallstones  kidney stones  urinary stones  arthrosis  and arthropathies have been observed  additionally  desalination processes can increase the risk of bacterial contamination 
manufacturers of home water distillers claim the oppositethat minerals in water are the cause of many diseases  and that most beneficial minerals come from food  not water  they quote the american medical association as saying  the body s need for minerals is largely met through foods  not drinking water   the who report agrees that  drinking water  with some rare exceptions  is not the major source of essential elements for humans  and is  not the major source of our calcium and magnesium intake   yet states that demineralized water is harmful anyway   additional evidence comes from animal experiments and clinical observations in several countries  animals given zinc or magnesium dosed in their drinking water had a significantly higher concentration of these elements in the serum than animals given the same elements in much higher amounts with food and provided with low-mineral water to drink

to purify the water supply dates to 1804  when the owner of a bleachery in   john gibb  installed an experimental filter  selling his unwanted surplus to the public  this method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies  and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world  installed by engineer

formally proposed the addition of chloride of lime    to water to render it  germ-free   two other investigators confirmed traube s findings and published their papers in 1895  early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in  
and in 1897 the city of
was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine 
permanent water chlorination began in 1905  when a faulty
and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in   dr  alexander cruickshank houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic  his installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated  the chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution  the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted 
manual-control chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification  early 20th century  from chlorination of water by joseph race  1918 
the first continuous use of chlorine in the
for disinfection took place in 1908 at boonton reservoir  on the    which served as the supply for   chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime    at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm  the treatment process was conceived by dr  john l  leal and the chlorination plant was designed by
over the next few years  chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world 
the technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a british officer in the   vincent b  nesfield  in 1903  according to his own account 
it occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found satisfactory     if suitable means could be found for using it     the next important question was how to render the gas portable  this might be accomplished in two ways  by liquefying it  and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels  having a jet with a very fine capillary canal  and fitted with a tap or a screw cap  the tap is turned on  and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required  the chlorine bubbles out  and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe  this method would be of use on a large scale  as for service water carts 
u s  army major   professor of chemistry at the   gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910  shortly thereafter  major william j  l  lyster of the
used a solution of
in a linen bag to treat water  for many decades  lyster s method remained the standard for u s  ground forces in the field and in camps  implemented in the form of the familiar lyster bag  also spelled lister bag   this work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water purification
