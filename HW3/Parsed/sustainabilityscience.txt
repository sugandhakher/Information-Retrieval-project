sustainability science has emerged in the 21st century as a new academic discipline  this new field of science was officially introduced with a  birth statement  at the world congress  challenges of a changing earth 2001  in amsterdam organized by the
 icsu   the international geosphere-biosphere programme     the international human dimensions programme on global environmental change and the
 wcrp  
the field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of sustainability a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it 
    brings together scholarship and practice  global and local perspectives from north and south  and disciplines across the natural and social sciences  engineering  and medicine  it can be usefully thought of as  neither basic nor applied research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs  it serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two  
the field is focused on examining the interactions between human  environmental  and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet  such as climate change  biodiversity loss  pollution and land and water degradation 
sustainability science  like
itself  derives some impetus from the concepts of
and   sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability while
provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide

definition  
consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of  sustainability  or  sustainable development   as outlined by the sustainability science program at harvard university s center for international development sustainability science seeks to 
advance basic understanding of the dynamics of human-environment systems  to facilitate the design  implementation  and evaluation of practical interventions that promote sustainability in particular places and contexts  and to improve linkages between relevant research and innovation communities on the one hand  and relevant policy and management communities on the other 
a more broad-based definition is 
the cultivation  integration  and application of knowledge about earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences  such as geology  ecology  climatology  oceanography  coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities  in order to evaluate  mitigate  and minimize the consequences  regionally and worldwide  of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future  that is  in order that humans can be knowledgeable earth stewards 
it has been noted that the new paradigm
 must encompass different magnitudes of scales  of time  space  and function   multiple balances  dynamics   multiple actors  interests  and multiple failures  systemic faults   
others take a much broader view of sustainability science  emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system  such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancying society s well-being  in a 2012 article entitled  sustainability science needs to include sustainable consumption   published in environment  science and policy for sustainable development  halina brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society  the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices  as well as in solving the problems they create  the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being  and others 
broad objectives  
the case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s  promoted by the brundtland commission s report
in 1987  and noted in the
plan that emerged from the
in 1992 and further developed at the   held in johannesburg in 2002 
the topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science  only in 2010 have the seminal papers and thinking of sustainability scientists been drawn together  in 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published by robert kates  with introduction by william clark  as  readings in sustainability science and technology - an introduction to the key literature of sustainability science  the 2012 commentary by halina brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication  this is work in progress  the 2012 encyclopedia of sustainability science and technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology 
knowledge structuring of issues  
knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected  this is needed as a response to the requirements of academia  industry and government 
coordination of data  
the key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines  topics and organisations  a major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an overview of what is known  sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed 
interdisciplinary approaches  
the attempt  by sustainability science  to understand the integrated whole of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific  social and economic disciplines  public and private sectors  academia and government  in short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination
