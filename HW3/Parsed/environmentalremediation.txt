environmental remediation deals with the removal of
or
from
media such as       or   this would mean that once requested by the government or a land remediation authority  immediate action should be taken as this can impact negatively on human health and the environment 
is generally subject to an array of
requirements  and also can be based on assessments of human
and
risks where no legislated standards exist or where standards are advisory

remediation standards  
in the   the most comprehensive set of preliminary remediation goals  prgs  is from the
 epa  region 9  a set of standards used in
exists and is often called the   the
 eu  is rapidly moving towards europe-wide standards  although most of the
nations in
have their own standards at present  in   most standards for remediation are set by the provinces individually  but the canadian council of ministers of the environment provides guidance at a federal level in the form of the canadian environmental quality guidelines and the canada-wide standards canada-wide standard for petroleum hydrocarbons in soil 
site assessment  
once a site is suspected of being contaminated there is a need to assess the contamination  often the assessment begins with preparation of a   the historical use of the site and the materials used and produced on site will guide the assessment
and type of
and
to be done  often nearby sites owned by the same company or which are nearby and have been reclaimed  levelled or filled are also contaminated even where the current land use seems innocuous  for example  a car park may have been levelled by using contaminated waste in the   also important is to consider off site contamination of nearby sites often through decades of emissions to     and air  ceiling dust    surface and groundwater of nearby properties should also be tested  both before and after any remediation  this is a controversial step as 
no one wants to have to pay for the cleanup of the site 
if nearby properties are found to be contaminated it may have to be noted on their
title  potentially affecting the value 
no one wants to pay for the cost of assessment 
often
which do voluntary testing of their sites are protected from the reports to environmental agencies becoming public under   however a  freedom of information  inquiry will often produce other documents that are not protected or will produce references to the reports 
funding remediation  
in the us there has been a mechanism for
polluting industries to form a
to remediate abandoned sites  or to
to force corporations to remediate their contaminated sites  other countries have other mechanisms and commonly sites are rezoned to  higher  uses such as high density housing  to give the land a higher value so that after deducting cleanup costs there is still an incentive for a developer to purchase the land  clean it up  redevelop it and sell it on  often as apartments  home units  
mapping remediation  
there are several tools for mapping these sites and which allow the user to view additional information  one such tool is   a geographic information system  gis  from the division of specialized information services
of the
 nlm  that uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the  s  epa 
and
programs 
technologies  
remediation technologies are many and varied but can generally be categorized into ex-situ and in-situ methods  ex-situ methods involve excavation of affected soils and subsequent treatment at the surface as well as extraction of contaminated groundwater and treatment at the surface  in-situ methods seek to treat the contamination without removing the soils or groundwater  various technologies have been developed for  
traditional remediation approaches consist of soil excavation and disposal to
and
 pump and treat   in-situ technologies include but are not limited to      permeable reactive barriers  monitored natural attenuation  -  chemical oxidation  steam-enhanced extraction and
and have been used extensively in the usa 
thermal desorption  
is a technology for soil remediation  during the process a desorber volatilizes the contaminants  e g  oil  mercury or hydrocarbon  to separate them from especially soil or sludge  after that the contaminants can either be collected or destroyed in an offgas treatment system 
excavation or dredging  
processes can be as simple as hauling the
to a regulated   but can also involve
the excavated material in the case of   recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds  svocs  onsite  if the contamination affects a river or bay bottom  then dredging of
or other
containing contaminants may be conducted  recently  exsitu chemical oxidation has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil  this process involves the excavation of the contaminated area into large bermed areas where they are treated using chemical oxidation methods 
surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation  sear   
also known as solubilization and recovery  the surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation process involves the injection of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty
into the subsurface to enhance desorption and recovery of bound up otherwise recalcitrant non aqueous phase liquid  napl  
in geologic formations that allow delivery of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants  this approach provides a cost effective and permanent solution to sites that have been previously unsuccessful utilizing other remedial approaches  this technology is also successful when utilized as the initial step in a multi faceted remedial approach utilizing sear then in situ oxidation  bioremediation enhancement or soil vapor extraction  sve  
pump and treat  
pump and treat involves pumping out contaminated groundwater with the use of a submersible or   and allowing the extracted groundwater to be
by slowly proceeding through a series of vessels that contain materials designed to
the contaminants from the groundwater  for petroleum-contaminated sites this material is usually
in granular form  chemical
such as
followed by
may also be used to decrease the contamination of groundwater 
is a method that can be effective for volatile pollutants such as
compounds found in gasoline 
for most biodegradable materials like  
and most hydrocarbons  bioreactors can be used to clean the contaminated water to non-detectable levels  with fluidized bed bioreactors it is possible to achieve very low discharge concentrations which will meet or exceed discharge requirements for most pollutants 
depending on
and soil type  pump and treat may be a good method to quickly reduce high concentrations of pollutants  it is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards  due to the equilibrium of   processes in the soil  however  pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation  it is expensive to treat the groundwater  and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat  it is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further  better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge soil vapor extraction  as sve  or dual phase extraction multiphase extraction dpe mpe   other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound  especially petroleum  by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface  or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time  typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide  
solidification and stabilization  
solidification and stabilization work has a reasonably good track record but also a set of serious deficiencies related to durability of solutions and potential long-term effects  in addition co2 emissions due to the use of cement are also becoming a major obstacle to its widespread use in solidification stabilization projects 
stabilization solidification  s s  is a remediation and treatment technology that relies on the reaction between a binder and soil to stop prevent or reduce the mobility of contaminants 
stabilization involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material  e g  soil or sludge  to produce more chemically stable constituents  and
solidification involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material to impart physical dimensional stability to contain contaminants in a solid product and reduce access by external agents  e g  air  rainfall  
conventional s s is an established remediation technology for contaminated soils and treatment technology for hazardous wastes in many countries in the world  however  the uptake of s s technologies has been relatively modest  and a number of barriers have been identified including 
the relatively low cost and widespread use of disposal to landfill 
the lack of authoritative technical guidance on s s 
uncertainty over the durability and rate of contaminant release from s s-treated material 
experiences of past poor practice in the application of cement stabilization processes used in waste disposal in the 1980s and 1990s  ends  1992   and
residual liability associated with immobilized contaminants remaining on-site  rather than their removal or destruction 
in situ oxidation  
new
technologies have become popular  for remediation of a wide range of soil and groundwater contaminants  remediation by
involves the injection of strong
such as  
gas 
or persulfates 
gas or ambient air can also be injected to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants  one disadvantage of this approach is the possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction
where existing conditions enhance anaerobic
which normally live in the soil prefer a   in general though  aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted 
the injection of
into the groundwater may also cause contamination to spread faster than normal depending on the site s   in these cases  injections downgradient of groundwater flow may provide adequate microbial destruction of contaminants prior to exposure to surface waters or drinking water supply wells 
migration of metal contaminants must also be considered whenever modifying subsurface oxidation-reduction potential  certain metals are more soluble in oxidizing environments while others are more mobile in reducing environments 
soil vapor extraction  
 sve  is an effective remediation technology for soil   multi phase extraction   mpe  is also an effective remediation technology when soil and groundwater are to be remediated coincidentally  sve and mpe utilize different technologies to treat the off-gas volatile organic compounds  vocs  generated after vacuum removal of air and vapors  and vocs  from the subsurface and include granular activated carbon  most commonly used historically   thermal and or catalytic oxidation and vapor condensation  generally  carbon is used for low  below 500 ppmv  voc concentration vapor streams  oxidation is used for moderate  up to 4,000 ppmv  voc concentration streams  and vapor condensation is used for high  over 4,000 ppmv  voc concentration vapor streams  below is a brief summary of each technology 
granular
 gac  is used as a filter for air or water  commonly used to filter tap water in household sinks  gac is a highly porous adsorbent material  produced by heating organic matter  such as coal  wood and coconut shell  in the absence of air  which is then crushed into granules  activated carbon is positively charged and therefore able to remove negative ions from the water such as organic ions  ozone  chlorine  fluorides and dissolved organic solutes by adsorption onto the activated carbon  the activated carbon must be replaced periodically as it may become saturated and unable to adsorb  i e  reduced absorption efficiency with loading   activated carbon is not effective in removing heavy metals 
thermal
 or   can also be an effective remediation technology  this approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of
released in the
through the
or effluent off-gas  controlled  high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks  two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream  the selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream  thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration   4,000 ppmv  influent vapor streams  which require less
usage  than
oxidation at  2,000 ppmv 
thermal oxidation which uses a system that acts as a furnace and maintains temperatures ranging from 1,350 to 1,500f  730 to 820c  
catalytic oxidation which uses a
on a support to facilitate a lower temperature oxidation  this system usually maintains temperatures ranging from 600 to 800f  316 to 427c  
is the most effective off-gas treatment technology for high  over 4,000 ppmv  voc concentration vapor streams  the process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below 40 degrees c such that the vocs condensate out of the vapor stream and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers  the liquid form of the vocs is referred to as
 dnapl  when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or
 lnapl  when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products  this recovered chemical can then be
or
in a more
or
manner than the alternatives described above  this technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression    
nanoremediation  
using nano-sized reactive agents to degrade or immobilize contaminants is termed   in soil or groundwater nanoremediation 
are brought into contact with the contaminant through either in situ injection or a pump-and-treat process  the nanomaterials then degrade organic contaminants through
reactions or adsorb to and immobilize metals such as
or   in commercial settings  this technology has been dominantly applied to   with research into   research is also investigating how nanoparticles may be applied to cleanup of soil and gases 
nanomaterials are highly reactive because of their high
per unit mass  and due to this reactivity nanomaterials may react with target contaminants at a faster rate than would larger particles  most field applications of nanoremediation have used nano
 nzvi   which may be
or mixed with another metal to enhance dispersion 
that nanoparticles are highly reactive can mean that they rapidly clump together or react with soil particles or other material in the environment  limiting their dispersal to target contaminants  some of the important challenges currently limiting nanoremediation technologies include identifying coatings or other formulations that increase dispersal of the nanoparticle agents to better reach target contaminants while limiting any potential toxicity to bioremediation agents  wildlife  or people 
bioremediation  
the treatment of environmental problems through
means is known as
and the specific use of
for example by using   bioremediation is sometimes used in conjunction with a pump and treat system  in bioremediation  either naturally occurring or specially bred bacteria are used to consume contaminants from extracted groundwater  this is sometimes referred to as a bio-gac system  many times the groundwater is recycled to allow for continuously flowing water and enhanced bacteria population growth  occasionally the bacteria can build up to such a point that they can affect filtration and pumping  the vessel should then be partially drained  care must be taken to ensure that a sharp change in the
chemistry does not kill the bacteria  such as a sudden change in   
dual-phase extraction utilizes a soil vapor extraction system that produces a high vacuum resulting in the extraction of both contaminated vapors as well as a limited amount of contaminated groundwater  this method is somewhat inefficient due to large amount of energy required by pulling water by vacuum compared to pushing water with a submersible pump 
mycoremediation is a form of bioremediation  the process of using fungi to return an environment  usually soil  contaminated by pollutants to a less contaminated state 
in an experiment conducted in conjunction with batelle  a major contributor in the bioremediation industry  a plot of soil contaminated with diesel oil was inoculated with mycelia of oyster mushrooms  traditional bioremediation techniques  bacteria  were used on control plots  after four weeks  more than 95  of many of the pah  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  had been reduced to non-toxic components in the mycelial-inoculated plots  it appears that the natural microbial community participates with the fungi to break down contaminants into carbon dioxide and water  wood-degrading fungi are particularly effective in breaking down aromatic pollutants  toxic components of petroleum   as well as chlorinated compounds  certain persistent pesticides  battelle  2000   hair mats inoculated with oyster mushrooms were successfully employed in the clean-up of the san francisco bay area oil spill in 2007 
the key to mycoremediation is determining the right fungal species to target a specific pollutant  certain strains have also been reported to successfully degrade the nerve gases vx and sarin 
mycofiltration is a very similar process  using mycelial mats to filter toxic waste and microorganisms from polluted water 
cleaning with collapsing air microbubbles  
cleaning of oil contaminated sediments with self collapsing air microbubbles have been recently explored as a chemical free technology  air microbubbles generated in water without adding any surfactant could be used to clean oil contaminated sediments  this technology holds promise over the use of chemicals  mainly surfactant  for traditional washing of oil contaminated sediments 
community consultation and information  
in preparation for any significant remediation there should be extensive community consultation  the proponent should both present information to and seek information from the community  the proponent needs to learn about  sensitive   future  uses like childcare  schools  hospitals  and playgrounds as well as community concerns and interests information  consultation should be open  on a group basis so that each member of the community is informed about issues they may not have individually thought about  an independent chairperson acceptable to both the proponent and the community should be engaged  at proponent expense if a fee is required   minutes of meetings including questions asked and the answers to them and copies of presentations by the proponent should be available both on the
and at a local library  even a school library  or community centre 
incremental health risk  
incremental health risk is the increased
that a receptor  normally a human being living nearby  will face from  the lack of  a remediation project  the use of
health risk is based on
and other  e g       effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in   in some
this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000  a relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions  or if other projects exist at the same time causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk  an analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through
or  
emissions standards  
standards are set for the levels of dust  noise  odour  emissions to air and groundwater  and discharge to sewers or waterways of all chemicals of concern or chemicals likely to be produced during the remediation by processing of the contaminants  these are compared against both natural background levels in the area and standards for areas zoned as nearby areas are zoned and against standards used in other recent remediations  just because the emission is emanating from an area zoned industrial does not mean that in a nearby residential area there should be permitted any exceedances of the appropriate residential standards 
monitoring for compliance against each standards is critical to ensure that exceedances are detected and reported both to authorities and the local community 
enforcement is necessary to ensure that continued or significant breaches result in fines or even a
for the polluter 
penalties must be significant as otherwise fines are treated as a normal expense of doing business  compliance must be cheaper than to have continuous breaches 
transport and emergency safety assessment  
assessment should be made of the risks of operations  transporting contaminated material  disposal of waste which may be contaminated including workers  clothes  and a formal emergency response plan should be developed  every worker and visitor entering the site should have a safety induction personalised to their involvement with the site 
impacts of funding remediation  
the rezoning is often resisted by local communities and local government because of the adverse effects on the local amenity of the remediation and the new development  the main impacts during remediation are noise  dust  odour and incremental health risk  then there is the noise  dust and traffic of developments  then there is the impact on local traffic  schools  playing fields  and other public facilities of the often vastly increased local population 
examples of major remediation projects  
homebush bay  new south wales  australia  
homebush bay  new south wales 
has been the subject of a controversial remediation project 
in this case the proposed rezoning  remediation and redevelopment has a wealth of material available through the internet from  
numerous investigations and reports by australian and international consultants
for the former
site  a previous remediation by excavation and containment in a clay capped sarcophagus  separated from the bay by a
wall 
a parliamentary inquiry by the upper house of the parliament of   a state of australia 
two commissions of inquiry  one for each of the major
  both contaminated by the operations of union carbide 
resolutions by the relevant local government bodies  originally concord council and after the municipality of concord was merged with drummoyne council to form the city of   by that council  
campaigns by local residents  groups 
australia    and inner west  of
branch of the  greens
published submissions by planning nsw and environmental protection agency of nsw 
comprehensive environmental impact studies published in digital format and available on cd from planning nsw 
this rezoning  remediation and redevelopment of land contaminated by union carbide 
and others also involves the remediation of a strip of dioxin contaminated sediments in   the homebush bay area was home to the main events of the
  the
was addressed in the commission of inquiry into the lednez site formerly owned by union carbide  but not to the satisfaction of local community activists 
the remediation of homebush bay is important because of its impact on the
which extends through
not only to local protected and threatened species of birds  but also to
and
protected species and species which use other -protected wetlands  ultimately human health is affected through the food chain  homebush bay has a complete fishing ban  there is a commercial fin fishing ban west of the   and based on submissions of the remediator and nsw waterways and epa the complete fishing ban ought be extended to the whole of the
west of homebush bay and at least as far east as the ryde traffic bridge
