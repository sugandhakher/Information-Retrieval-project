energy storage is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time  a device that stores energy is sometimes called an   energy comes in multiple forms including radiation        electricity  elevated temperature 
and   energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms  bulk energy storage is dominated by pumped hydro  which accounts for 99  of global energy storage 
some technologies provide short-term energy storage  while others can endure for much longer

history  
prehistory  
the energy present at the initial formation of the
is stored in stars such as the   and is used by humans directly  e g  through
or    or indirectly  e g  by growing crops  consuming photosynthesized plants or conversion into electricity in solar cells  
as a purposeful activity  energy storage has existed since pre-history  though it was often not explicitly recognized as such  an example of mechanical energy storage is the use of logs or boulders as defensive measures in ancient fortsthe logs or boulders were collected at the top of a hill or wall  and the energy thus stored was used to attack invaders who came within range  certainly  storing dried wood or another source for fire  or preserving edible food or seeds  in dry or cool areas such as in a cave  under rocks or underground  serves as other examples of energy storage 
recent history  
in the twentieth century grid electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel  when less power was required  less fuel was burned  concerns with air pollution  energy imports and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power  wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed  solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours  while demand often peaks after sunset  see    interest in storing power from these intermittent sources grows as the renewable energy industry begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption 
use was a niche market in the twentieth century  but in the twenty first century it has expanded  portable devices are in use all over the world  solar panels are now a common sight in the rural settings worldwide  access to electricity is now a question of economics  not location  powering transportation without burning fuel  however  remains in development

that convert electric energy into kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks 
hydroelectricity  
main article 
with reservoirs can be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand  water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high  the net effect is similar to pumped storage  but without the pumping loss 
while a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units  it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources  in this mode  dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage  because only the timing of its generation changes  hydroelectric turbines have a start-up time on the order of a few minutes

varies in practice between 70  and 80   with claims of up to 87  
at times of low electrical demand  excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir  when demand grows  water is released back into a lower reservoir  or waterway or body of water  through a   generating electricity  reversible turbine-generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine  usually a
design   nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies  pure pumped-storage plants shift the water between reservoirs  while the  pump-back  approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional

and
flywheel energy storage  fes  works by accelerating a rotor    to a very high speed  holding energy as   when energy is extracted  the flywheel s rotational speed declines as a consequence of   adding energy correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel 
most fes systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel  but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration 
fes systems have rotors made of high strength
composites  suspended by

and
a rechargeable battery  comprises one or more   it is known as a  secondary cell  because its
are electrically reversible  rechargeable batteries come in many different shapes and sizes  ranging from
to megawatt grid systems 
rechargeable batteries have lower total cost of use and environmental impact than non-rechargeable  disposable  batteries  some rechargeable battery types are available in the same
as disposables  rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times 
common rechargeable battery chemistries include 
  lead acid batteries hold the largest market share of electric storage products  a single cell produces about 2v when charged  in the charged state the metallic lead negative electrode and the
positive electrode are immersed in a dilute
 h2so4    in the discharge process electrons are pushed out of the cell as lead sulfate is formed at the negative electrode while the electrolyte is reduced to water

operates by passing a solution over a membrane where ions are exchanged to charge discharge the cell 
is chemically determined by the
and ranges  in practical applications  from 1.0 to 2.2 v  its storage capacity is a function of the volume of the tanks holding the solution 
a flow battery is technically akin both to a

main article 
  also called electric double-layer capacitors  edlc  or ultracapacitors  are generic terms for a family of
that do not have conventional solid  
is determined by two storage principles  double-layer capacitance and  
supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and   they store the most energy per unit volume or mass    among capacitors  they support up to 10,000  1.2volt  up to 10,000 times that of   but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time    
while supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10  of batteries  their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater  this results in much shorter charge discharge cycles  additionally  they will tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than batteries 
supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications  including 
low supply current for memory backup in
 sram 
power for cars  buses  trains  cranes and elevators  including energy recovery from braking  short-term energy storage and burst-mode power delivery
ultrabattery  
main article 
the
is a hybrid lead-acid cell and carbon-based
 or supercapacitor  invented by australias national research body  the
 csiro   the lead-acid cell and ultracapacitor share the sulfuric acid electrolyte and both are packaged into the same physical unit  the ultrabattery can be manufactured with similar physical and electrical characteristics to conventional lead-acid batteries making it possible to cost-effectively replace many lead-acid applications 
the ultrabattery tolerates high charge and discharge levels and endures large numbers of cycles  outperforming previous lead-acid cells by more than an order of magnitude  in hybrid-electric vehicle tests  millions of cycles have been achieved  the ultrabattery is also highly tolerant to the effects of sulfation compared with traditional lead-acid cells  this means it can operate continuously in partial state of charge whereas traditional lead-acid batteries are generally held at full charge between discharge events  it is generally electrically inefficient to fully charge a lead-acid battery so by decreasing time spent in the top region of charge the ultrabattery achieves high efficiencies  typically between 85 and 95  dc-dc 
the ultrabattery can work across a wide range of applications  the constant cycling and fast charging and discharging necessary for applications such as grid regulation and leveling and electric vehicles can damage chemical batteries  but are well handled by the ultracapacitive qualities of ultrabattery technology  the technology has been installed in australia and the us on the megawatt scale  performing frequency regulation and renewable smoothing applications

methane combustion produces carbon dioxide  co2  and water  the carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis  methane production  storage and combustion recycles the reaction products 
the co2 has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector  not a cost as in  
power to liquid  
power to liquid is similar to power to gas  however the hydrogen produced by electrolysis from wind and solar electricity isn t converted into gases such as methane but into liquids such as   methanol is easier in handling than gases and requires less safety precautions than hydrogen  it can be used for   including   but also for industrial purposes or in the power sector

home energy storage  
main article 
home energy storage is expected to become increasingly present given the growing importance of distributed generation  especially photovoltaics  and the important share of energy consumption in buildings  a household equipped with photovoltaics can achieve a maximum electricity self-sufficiency of about 40   to reach higher levels of self-sufficiency energy storage is needed  given the mismatch between energy consumption and energy production from photovoltaics  in 2015  multiple manufacturers announced rechargeable battery systems for storing energy  generally to hold surplus energy from home solar wind generation 
announced the first two models of the   one is a 10 kwh weekly cycle version for backup applications and the other is a 7 kwh version for daily cycle applications 
announced an integrated system that allows home users to store  monitor and manage electricity  the system stores 1.2 kwh hours of energy and 275w 500w power output 
grid electricity  
main article 
renewable energy storage  
construction of the salt tanks which provide efficient
so that output can be provided after the sun goes down  and output can be scheduled to meet demand requirements  the 280 mw
is designed to provide six hours of energy storage  this allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year 
the 150 mw
is a commercial
power plant  located in   the andasol plant uses
to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isn t shining 
the largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams  a large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons  a very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years  while a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources  it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind  if wind or solar generation exceeds the regions hydroelectric capacity  then some additional source of energy will be needed 
many
sources  notably solar and wind  produce   storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes  electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms 
the main method of electrical grid storage is   areas of the world such as norway  wales  japan and the us have used elevated geographic features for   using electrically powered pumps to fill them  when needed  the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity  pumped storage in norway  which gets almost all its electricity from hydro  has an instantaneous capacity of 2530 gw expandable to 60 gwenough to be  europe s battery  
some forms of storage that produce electricity include pumped-storage    
including
which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy  and    
and  
surplus power can also be converted into
   with stockage in the natural gas network 
in 2011  the
in
created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds  under central control  home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in
to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified   after charging  the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed  the experimental system was created as a result of a severe 2010 storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down  or in the case of a nuclear power plant  reduced to its lowest possible operating level  leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy 
another advanced method used at
in the united states and the
in spain uses
to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power  the system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun  insulated tanks store the solution  electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to  
since the early 21st century batteries have been applied to utility scale load-leveling and
capabilities 
in
storage  electric vehicles that are plugged into the energy grid can deliver stored electrical energy from their batteries into the grid when needed 
generation  
chemical fuels remain the dominant form of energy storage for electricity generation  natural gas is crowding out other forms  such as oil and coal 
air conditioning  
main article 
 tes  can be used for   it is most widely used for cooling single large buildings and or groups of smaller buildings  commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads  in 2009  thermal storage was used in over 3,300 buildings in over 35 countries  it works by creating ice at night and using the ice to for cooling during the hotter daytime periods 
the most popular technique is   which requires less space than water and is less costly than fuel cells or flywheels  in this application  a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile  water then circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chiller s daytime output 
a partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day  at night  they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water  water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water  such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day  capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40 - 50  of the size needed for a conventional  no-storage design  storage sufficient to store half a day s available heat is usually adequate 
a full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours  capital costs are higher  as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system 
this ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower  off-peak cooling systems can lower energy costs  the u s 
has developed the
 leed  program to encourage the design of reduced-environmental impact buildings  off-peak cooling may help toward leed certification 
thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling  an example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night 
latent heat can also be stored in technical
 pcms   these can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels  to moderate room temperatures

main article 
the
 iesdb   is a free-access database of energy storage projects and policies funded by the
office of electricity and  
economics  
the economics of energy storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested  and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of energy storage  therefore not every energy storage is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several mwh  and the optimal size of the energy storage is market and location dependent 
moreover  ess are affected by several risks  e g  
1  techno-economic risks  which are related to the specific technology 
2  market risks  which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system 
3  regulation and policy risks 
therefore  traditional techniques based on deterministic
 dcf  for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investors flexibility to deal with them  hence  the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the real option analysis  roa   which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts 
the economic valuation of large-scale applications  including pumped hydro storage and compressed air  considers benefits including  wind curtailment avoidance  grid congestion avoidance  price arbitrage and carbon free energy delivery  in one technical assessment by the   economic goals could be met with batteries if energy storage were achievable at a capital cost of  30 to  50 per kilowatt-hour of storage capacity 
a metric for calculating the energy efficiency of storage systems is energy storage on energy invested  esoi  which is the useful energy used to make the storage system divided into the lifetime energy storage  for lithium ion batteries this is around 10  and for lead acid batteries it is about 2  other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher esoi  such as 210
