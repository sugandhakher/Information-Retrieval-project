and agricultural societies  in 1839  congress established the agricultural division within the
and allotted  1,000 for  the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes  
ellsworth s interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the new seeds and plants  a clerk to collect agricultural statistics  statewide reports about crops in different regions  and the application of chemistry to agriculture  ellsworth was called the  father of the department of agriculture  
in 1849  the patent office was transferred to the newly created   in the ensuing years  agitation for a separate
of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring

discrimination  
allegations have been made that throughout the agency s history that its personnel have discriminated against
farmers  denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s  the effect of this discrimination has been the reduction in the number of african-american farmers in the united states  in 1999  the usda settled a class action lawsuit  the   alleging discrimination against african-american farmers in the late twentieth century  the government s settlement of nearly  1 billion with more than 13,300 farmers was reportedly the largest civil rights claim to date  the 2008 farm bill provided for additional farmers to have their claims heard  as 70,000 had filed late in the original program  in 2010 the federal government made another  1.2 billion settlement in what is called pigford ii for outstanding claims 
many black farmers across the nation experienced discrimination in their dealings with in-state usda agencies  across the nation  black farmers alleged  and the usda later agreed  they were denied access to loans and subsidies provided by the government  on a national level  farm subsidies that were afforded to white farmers were not afforded to black farmers  since they were denied government loans  emergency or disaster assistance  and other aid  many black farmers lost their farms and homes 
pigford v  glickman  
main article 
following long-standing concerns  black farmers joined a
discrimination suit against the usda filed in federal court in 1997  an attorney called it  the most organized  largest civil rights case in the history of the country  
also in 1997  black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the usda headquarters in
protests in front of the usda were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers  representatives of the
met with president
and other administration officials at the   and nbfa s president testified before the  
in   u s  federal district court judge
approved the settlement and consent decree on april 14  1999  the settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers but the nbfa would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded  nevertheless  the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in american history  lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than  2 billion  some farmers would have their debts forgiven  judge friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement  farmers in alabama  mississippi  arkansas  and georgia were among those affected by the settlement 
reopening of case  
the nbfa s president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement including before the
on september 12  2000  when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement  nbfa asked congress to pass legislation that would ensure a full resolution of the discrimination cases 
and nbfa issued a report in july 2004 accusing the usda of withholding nearly three out of every four dollars in the multibillion-dollar settlement of discrimination cases  the report says that the u s  department of justice and the usda pursued a path of  willful obstruction of justice  in blocking many of the cases  it was later revealed that one doj staff  general attorney  was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers  cases  nbfa called for all those cases to be reheard 
in 2006 the
 gao  issued a report highly critical of the usda in its handling of the black farmers cases 
nbfa continued to lobby congress to provide relief  nbfa s boyd secured congressional support for legislation that would provide  100 million in funds to settle late-filer cases  in 2006 a bill was introduced into the house of representatives and later the senate by senator  
in 2007 boyd testified before the
about this legislation 
as the organization was making headway by gathering congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some usda farm services agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers 
president   then a u s  senator  lent his support to the black farmers  issues in 2007  a bill cosponsored by obama passed the senate in 2007 
the senate and house versions of the black farmers bill  reopening black farmers discrimination cases  became law in 2008  the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers according to some news reports 
in 2008 hundreds of black farmers  denied a chance to have their cases heard in the pigford settlement  filed a new lawsuit against usda 
in 2008  the gao issued a report criticizing the usda s handling of discrimination complaints  the gao recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints 
after numerous public rallies and an intensive nbfa member lobbying effort  congress approved and obama signed into law in december 2010 legislation that set aside  1.15 billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers cases  nbfa s john w  boyd  jr   attended the bill-signing ceremony at the white house 
as of 2013  90,000 african-american  hispanic  female and native american farmers had filed claims  some fraudulent  or even transparently bogus  lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the usda practice of discarding denied applications after three years  in   north carolina  the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with 1 out of 9 african-americans being paid 
the result of such longstanding discrimination is that black farmers have been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers  in 1920  1 in 7 u s  farmers was african-american  and now the number is 1 in 100  usda spokesman ed loyd  when acknowledging that the usda loan process was unfair to minority farmers  has claimed it is hard to determine the effect on such farmers
