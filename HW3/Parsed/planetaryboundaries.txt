planetary boundaries according to rockstrm et al  2009 and steffen et al  2015  the green areas represent human activities that are within safe margins  the yellow areas represent human activities that may or may not have exceeded safe margins  the red areas represent human activities that have exceeded safe margins  and the gray areas with red question marks represent human activities for which safe margins have not yet been determined 
planetary boundaries is the central concept in an earth system framework proposed by a group of
and
led by
from the
and
from the   in 2009  the group proposed a framework of planetary boundaries designed to define a safe operating space for humanity for the international community  including governments at all levels  international organizations  civil society  the scientific community and the   as a precondition for   this framework is based on scientific research that indicates that since the industrial revolution  human actions have gradually become the main driver of global environmental change  the scientists assert that once human activity has passed certain thresholds or tipping points  defined as planetary boundaries  there is a risk of irreversible and abrupt environmental change  the scientists identified nine earth system processes which have boundaries that  to the extent that they are not crossed  mark the safe zone for the planet  however  because of human activities some of these dangerous boundaries have already been crossed  while others are in imminent danger of being crossed 
rockstrm and steffen collaborated with 26 leading academics  including
laureate  
climate scientist
and the  s chief climate adviser   the group identified nine  planetary life support systems  essential for human survival  and attempted to quantify just how far seven of these systems have been pushed already  they then estimated how much further we can go before our own survival is threatened  beyond these boundaries there is a risk of  irreversible and abrupt environmental change  which could make earth less   estimates indicate that three of these boundaries  biodiversity loss  and the biogeochemical flow boundaryappear to have been crossed  the boundaries are  rough  first estimates only  surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps  that interact in ways that are complex and not well understood  boundaries can help identify where there is room and define a  safe space for human development   which is an improvement on approaches which aim at just minimizing
on the planet 
the group published their full findings in a 2009 report and presented it to the general assembly of the
in amsterdam  an edited summary of the report was subsequently published as the featured article in a special edition of   nature also published critical commentary from leading academics they invited to comment on each of the seven planetary boundaries which had been quantified  including comments from nobel laureate
and biologist

background  
the idea of planetary boundaries or limits  
the planet earth is a finite system  which means it has limits
the idea that our planet has limits  including the burden placed upon it by human activities  has been around for some time  in 1972 
was published  it presented a model in which five variables    industrialization  pollution  food production  and   are examined  and considered to grow   whereas the ability of technology to increase resources availability is only   subsequently  the report was widely dismissed  particularly by economists and businessmen  and it has often been claimed that history has proved the projections to be incorrect  in 2008  graham turner from the
 csiro  published  a comparison of the limits to growth with thirty years of reality   turner found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely matches the simulated results of the  standard run  limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported   the comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time   turner also examined a number of reports  particularly by economists  which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model  turner says these reports are flawed  and reflect misunderstandings about the model  in 2010  nrgrd  peet and ragnarsdttir called the book a  pioneering report   and said that it  has withstood the test of time and  indeed  has only become more relevant  
with few exceptions  economics as a discipline has been dominated by a perception of living in an unlimited world  where resource and pollution problems in one area were solved by moving resources or people to other parts  the very hint of any global limitation as suggested in the report the limits to growth was met with disbelief and rejection by businesses and most economists  however  this conclusion was mostly based on false premises 
  
was published in 1987 by united nations    it tried to recapture the spirit of the   its aim was to interlock the concepts of development and environment for future political discussions  it introduced the famous definition for  

development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs 


of a different kind is the approach made by   in the 1970s he and
presented the   that states that all
and their
surroundings on earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system  the system has the ability to react to perturbations or deviations  much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature     nevertheless  this capacity has limits  for instance  when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range  it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments  similarly the earth may not be able to react to large deviations in critical parameters  in his book   he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity  compounded with the increase of
made by humans  is producing  
from holocene to anthropocene  
our planets ability to provide an accommodating environment for humanity is being challenged by our own activities  the environmentour life-support systemis changing rapidly from the stable holocene state of the last 12,000 years  during which we developed agriculture  villages  cities  and contemporary civilizations  to an unknown future state of significantly different conditions 

the
began about 10,000 years ago  it is the current
period  and it has proven to be a relatively stable environment of the earth  there have been natural environmental fluctuations during the holocene  but the key atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable  this stability and
has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive  according to rockstrm et al   we  have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life  and how we have organized society  technologies  and economies around them  that we must take the range within which earth system processes varied in the holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state

adapted from
since the   according to   will steffen and others  the planet has entered a new epoch  the   in the anthropocene  humans have become the main agents of change to the earth system  there have been well publicized scientific warnings about risks in the areas of climate change and stratospheric ozone  however  other
processes are also important  for example  since the advent of the anthropocene  the rate at which species are being extinguished has increased over 100 times  and humans are now the driving force altering global river flows as well as water vapor flows from the land surface  continuing pressure on the earth s biophysical systems from human activities raises concerns that further pressure could be destabilizing  and precipitate sudden or irreversible changes to the environment  it is difficult to address the issue  because the predominant paradigms of social and economic development are largely indifferent to the looming possibilities of large scale environmental disasters triggered by humans 
the nine boundaries  
thresholds and boundaries
the threshold  or climatological   is the value at which a very small increment for the control variable  like co2  produces a large  possibly catastrophic  change in the response variable  global warming  
the threshold points are difficult to locate  because the earth system is very complex  instead of defining the threshold value  the study establishes a range  and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it  the lower end of that range is defined as the boundary  therefore  it defines a safe space  in the sense that as long as we are below the boundary  we are below the threshold value  if the boundary is crossed  we enter into a danger zone

within - to planetary-scale systems  the 2009 study identified nine planetary boundaries and  drawing on current scientific understanding  the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them  these seven are climate change   concentration in the atmosphere   350 ppm and or a maximum change of  1 w m2 in

debate on the framework  
from the
science indicates that we are transgressing planetary boundaries that have kept civilization safe for the past 10,000 years  evidence is growing that human pressures are starting to overwhelm the earths buffering capacity  humans are now the most significant driver of   propelling the planet into a new geological epoch  the   we can no longer exclude the possibility that our collective actions will trigger tipping points  risking abrupt and irreversible consequences for human communities and ecological systems 

the framework of planetary boundaries and the associated planetary safety zone is new and evolving  it is drawing strong responses from scientists and advisors 
  director of the   is impressed   this kind of work is critically important  overall  this is an impressive attempt to define a safety zone   but the conservation biologist
is not impressed   i dont think this is in any way a useful way of thinking about things the notion of a single boundary is just devoid of serious content  in what way is an extinction rate 10 times the background rate acceptable   and the environmental policy analyst
thinks   tipping points in the earth system are dense  unpredictable    and unlikely to be avoidable through early warning indicators  it follows that     safe operating spaces  and  planetary boundaries  are thus highly suspect and potentially the new  opiates   
the biogeochemist
queries whether thresholds are a good idea for pollutions at all  he thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late   management based on thresholds  although attractive in its simplicity  allows pernicious  slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely  
the hydrologist david molden thinks planetary boundaries are a welcome new approach in the  limits to growth  debate   as a scientific organizing principle  the concept has many strengths       the numbers are important because they provide targets for policymakers  giving a clear indication of the magnitude and direction of change  they also provide benchmarks and direction for science  as we improve our understanding of earth processes and complex inter-relationships  these benchmarks can and will be updated       we now have a tool we can use to help us think more deeplyand urgentlyabout planetary limits and the critical actions we have to take  
the
peter brewer queries whether it is  truly useful to create a list of environmental limits without serious plans for how they may be achieved       they may become just another stick to beat citizens with  disruption of the global nitrogen cycle is one clear example  it is likely that a large fraction of people on earth would not be alive today without the artificial production of fertilizer  how can such ethical and economic issues be matched with a simple call to set limits        food is not optional  
the environment advisor steve bass says the  description of planetary boundaries is a sound idea  we need to know how to live within the unusually stable conditions of our present holocene period and not do anything that causes irreversible environmental change    their paper has profound implications for future governance systems  offering some of the  wiring  needed to link governance of national and global economies with governance of the environment and natural resources  the planetary boundaries concept should enable policymakers to understand more clearly that  like human rights and representative government  environmental change knows no borders  
the climate change policy advisor adele morris thinks that price-based policies are also needed to avoid political and economic thresholds   staying within a  safe operating space  will require staying within all the relevant boundaries  including the electorates willingness to pay  
in summary  the planetary boundary concept is a very important one  and its proposal should now be followed by discussions of the connections between the various boundaries and of their association with other concepts such as the     importantly  this novel concept highlights the risk of reaching thresholds or tipping points for non-linear or abrupt changes in earth-system processes  as such  it can help society to reach the agreements required for dealing effectively with existing global environmental threats  such as climate change 
 nobel laureate
in their report  2012  entitled  resilient people  resilient planet  a future worth choosing   the high-level panel on global sustainability called for bold global efforts   including launching a major global scientific initiative  to strengthen the interface between science and policy  we must define  through science  what scientists refer to as planetary boundaries  environmental thresholds and tipping points  
in 2011  at their second meeting  the high-level panel on global sustainability of the united nations had incorporated the concept of planetary boundaries into their framework  stating that their goal was   to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality  make growth inclusive  and production and consumption more sustainable while combating climate change and respecting the range of other planetary boundaries  
elsewhere in their proceedings  panel members have expressed reservations about the political effectiveness of using the concept of  planetary boundaries    planetary boundaries are still an evolving concept that should be used with caution    the planetary boundaries question can be divisive as it can be perceived as a tool of the north to tell the south not to follow the resource intensive and environmentally destructive development pathway that rich countries took themselves this language is unacceptable to most of the developing countries as they fear that an emphasis on boundaries would place unacceptable brakes on poor countries  
however  the concept is routinely used in the proceedings of the united nations  and in the un daily news  for example  the
executive director
states that the challenge of agriculture is to  feed a growing global population without pushing humanity s
beyond planetary boundaries   the
 unep  yearbook 2010 also repeated rockstrm s message  conceptually linking it with
and  
the planetary boundaries concept is also used in proceedings by the   and was referred to in the
synthesis report the european environment  state and outlook 2010 
debate on the boundaries  
there is debate about which boundaries are most relevant  and how or whether they can be usefully quantified 
climate change  
the black line shows the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration for the period 18802008  red bars show temperatures above and blue bars show temperatures below the average temperature  year-to-year temperature fluctuations are due to natural processes  such as the effects of     and the eruption of large volcanoes 
is a measure of the difference between the incoming
and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth  positive radiative forcing results in warming  from the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2005  the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to a positive radiative forcing  averaging about 1.66w m 
the climate scientist
thinks setting  a limit on long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations merely distracts from the much more immediate challenge of limiting warming to 2 c   he says the concentration of carbon dioxide is not a control variable we can  meaningfully claim to control   and he questions whether keeping carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm will avoid more than 2c of warming 
adele morris  policy director  climate and energy economics project    makes a criticism from the economical-political point of view  she puts emphasis in choosing policies that minimize costs and preserve consensus  she favors a system of   and   as ways to prevent global warming  she thinks that too-ambitious objectives  like the boundary limit on co2  may discourage such actions 
biodiversity loss  
according to the biologist   a   boundary that expresses the probability of families of species disappearing over time would better reflect our potential impacts on the future of life on earth  
the conservation ecologist gretchen daily claims that  it is time to confront the hard truth that traditional approaches to conservation  taken alone  are doomed to fail  nature reserves are too small  too few  too isolated and too subject to change to support more than a tiny fraction of earths biodiversity  the challenge is to make conservation attractivefrom economic and cultural perspectives  we cannot go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet  we depend on nature for food security  clean water  climate stability  seafood  timber  and other biological and physical services  to maintain these benefits  we need not just remote reserves but places everywheremore like  ecosystem service stations   a few pioneers are integrating conservation and human development  the costa rican government is paying landowners for ecosystem services from tropical forests  including carbon offsets  hydropower production  biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty 
is investing  100 billion in ecocompensation  including innovative policy and finance mechanisms that reward conservation and restoration  the country is also creating ecosystem function conservation areas that make up 18 percent of its land area  colombia and south africa have made dramatic policy changes  too  three advances would help the rest of the world scale such models of success  one  new science and tools to value and account for natural capital  in biophysical  economic and other terms       two  compelling demonstrations of such tools in resource policy  three  cooperation among governments  development organizations  corporations and communities to help nations build more durable economies while also maintaining critical ecosystem services  
biogeochemical  
nitrogen cycle  
since the industrial revolution  the earth s
has been disturbed even more than the carbon cycle   human activities now convert more nitrogen from the atmosphere into reactive forms than all of the earths terrestrial processes combined  much of this new reactive nitrogen pollutes waterways and coastal zones  is emitted back to the atmosphere in changed forms  or accumulates in the terrestrial biosphere   only a small part of the fertilizers applied in agriculture is used by plants  most of the nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in rivers  lakes and the sea  where excess amounts stress aquatic ecosystems  for example  fertilizer which discharges from rivers into the gulf of mexico has damaged
because of  
the biogeochemist
thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit for nitrogen deposition and other pollutions will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late  he says the boundary suggested for phosphorus is not sustainable  and would exhaust the known phosphorus reserves in less than 200 years 
with regard to nitrogen  the biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist robert howarth says   human activity has greatly altered the flow of nitrogen across the globe  the single largest contributor is fertilizer use  but the burning of fossil fuels actually dominates the problem in some regions  such as the northeastern u s  the solution in that case is to conserve energy and use it more efficiently  hybrid vehicles are another excellent fix  their nitrogen emissions are significantly less than traditional vehicles because their engines turn off while the vehicle is stopped   emissions from conventional vehicles actually rise when the engine is idling   nitrogen emissions from u s  power plants could be greatly reduced  too  if plants that predate the clean air act and its amendments were required to comply  these plants pollute far out of proportion to the amount of electricity they produce 
in agriculture  many farmers could use less fertilizer  and the reductions in crop yields would be small or nonexistent  runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corns roots penetrate only the top few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year  in addition  nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops  such as rye or wheat  which can help the soil hold nitrogen  these crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils  mitigating climate change  better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn  nitrogen losses are many times lower  nitrogen pollution from
 cafos  is a huge problem 
as recently as the 1970s  most animals were fed local crops  and the animals wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer  today most u s  animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away  making it uneconomical to return the manure  the solution  require cafo owners to treat their wastes  just as municipalities must do with human wastes  further  if we ate less meat  less waste would be generated and less synthetic fertilizer would be needed to grow animal feed  eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal  the explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution  several studies have suggested that if mandated u s  ethanol targets are met  the amount of nitrogen flowing down the
and fueling the gulf of mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent  the best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn  if the country wants to rely on biofuels  it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity  nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower  
phosphorus  
further information 
with regard to phosphorus  the ocean engineer david vaccari says that the most sustainable environmental
 would be the natural flux  seven million metric tons per year  mt yr   to hit that mark yet satisfy our usage of 22 mt yr  we would have to recycle or reuse 72 percent of our phosphorus    the flow could be reduced with existing technologies  lowering  the loss to waterways from 22 to 8.25 mt yr  not very much above the natural flux  
peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time at which the maximum global
production rate is reached  phosphorus is a scarce finite resource on earth and means of production other than mining are unavailable because of its non-gaseous environmental cycle  according to some researchers  earth s phosphorus reserves are expected to be completely depleted in 50100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030 
estimated change in sea surface ph from the pre-industrial period  1700s  to the present day  1990s    ph is in standard ph units 
ocean acidification  
has increased thirty percent since the industrial revolution  about one quarter of the additional carbon dioxide generated by humans is dissolved in the oceans  where it forms   this acidity inhibits the ability of corals  shellfish and plankton to build shells and skeletons 
could have serious consequences for   this boundary is clearly interconnected with the climate change boundaries  since the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also the underlying control variable for the ocean acidification boundary 
the ocean chemist peter brewer thinks  ocean acidification has impacts other than simple changes in ph  and these may need boundaries too  
the marine chemist scott doney thinks  the main tactics are raising energy efficiency  switching to renewable and nuclear power  protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies  regionally  nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification  the excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow  and as they die the added co2 from their decay acidifies the water  we have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage    locally  acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks  more practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries  larval mollusks such as clams and oysters appear to be more susceptible to acidification than adults  and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer ph and provide better substrate for larval attachment  the drop in ocean ph is expected to accelerate in coming decades  so marine ecosystems will have to adapt  we can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing  making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy  
land use  
europe land use map  human land uses include arable farmland  yellow  and pasture  light green 
across the planet  forests  wetlands and other vegetation types are being converted to agricultural and other   impacting freshwater  carbon and other cycles  and reducing biodiversity 
the environment advisor steve bass says research tells us that  the sustainability of land use depends less on percentages and more on other factors  for example  the environmental impact of 15 per cent coverage by intensively farmed cropland in large blocks will be significantly different from that of 15 per cent of land farmed in more sustainable ways  integrated into the landscape  the boundary of 15 per cent land-use change is  in practice  a premature policy guideline that dilutes the authors  overall scientific proposition  instead  the authors might want to consider a limit on soil degradation or soil loss  this would be a more valid and useful indicator of the state of terrestrial health  
the earth systems scientist eric lambin thinks that  intensive agriculture should be concentrated on land that has the best potential for high-yield crops    we can avoid losing the best agricultural land by controlling land degradation  freshwater depletion and urban sprawl  this step will require zoning and the adoption of more efficient agricultural practices  especially in developing countries  the need for farmland can be lessened  too  by decreasing waste along the food distribution chain  encouraging slower population growth  ensuring more equitable food distribution worldwide and significantly reducing meat consumption in rich countries  
freshwater  
overexploitation of
from an

human pressures on global
systems are having   the
is another boundary significantly affected by climate change  freshwater resources  such as lakes and   are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge  the term
is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don t recharge  
occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate  recharge usually comes from area streams  rivers and lakes  forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales  although generally forests are a major source of aquifer   depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as   or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean  this turns much of the world s underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to   though hubbert s original analysis did not apply to renewable resources  their overexploitation can result in a   a modified
applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced 
the
comments   few rational observers deny the need for boundaries to freshwater use  more controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them  another way to describe these boundaries is the concept of   three different ideas are useful   peak renewable  water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed  many of the worlds major rivers are already approaching this thresholdwhen evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources   peak nonrenewable  limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates  such as in fossil groundwater basins of the great plains  libya  india  northern china and parts of californias central valley   peak ecological  water is the idea that for any hydrological system  increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes  although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately  we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred    the good news is that the potential for savings  without hurting human health or economic productivity  is vast  improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector  more food can be grown with less water  and less water contamination  by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers  along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture  conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling  and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water  such as photovoltaics and wind  
the hydrologist david molden says  a global limit on water consumption is necessary  but the suggested planetary boundary of 4,000 cubic kilometres per year is too generous  
ozone depletion  
main article 
during 2130 september 2006 the average area of the antarctic ozone hole was the largest ever observed
the stratospheric
protectively filters
 uv  from the   which would otherwise damage biological systems  the actions taken after the
appeared to be keeping the planet within a safe boundary  however  in 2011  according to a paper published in nature  the boundary was unexpectedly        the fraction of the arctic vortex in march with total ozone less than 275 dobson units  du  is typically near zero  but reached nearly 45   
the nobel laureate in chemistry    says  five per cent is a reasonable limit for acceptable ozone depletion  but it doesn t represent a tipping point  
the physicist david fahey says that as a result of the montreal protocol  stratospheric ozone depletion will largely reverse by 2100  the gain has relied  in part  on intermediate substitutes  notably hydrochlorofluorocarbons  hcfcs   and the growing use of compounds that cause no depletion  such as hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs   ongoing success depends on several steps 
 continue observing the ozone layer to promptly reveal unexpected changes  ensure that nations adhere to regulations  for example  the hcfc phaseout will not be complete until 2030 
 maintain the scientific assessment panel under the protocol  it attributes causes of changes in the ozone layer and evaluates new chemicals for their potential to destroy ozone and contribute to climate change 
 maintain the technology and economic assessment panel  it provides information on technologies and substitute compounds that helps nations assess how the demand for applications such as refrigeration  air-conditioning and foam insulation can be met while protecting the ozone layer 
 the two panels will also have to evaluate climate change and ozone recovery together  climate change affects ozone abundance by altering the chemical composition and dynamics of the stratosphere  and compounds such as hcfcs and hfcs are greenhouse gases  for example  the large projected demand for hfcs could significantly contribute to climate change  
smog over southern china and vietnam
atmospheric aerosols  
particles in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence
and global
systems  some aerosols produce clouds which cool the earth by reflecting sunlight back to space  while others  like soot  produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse  warming the earth  on balance  anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative
 cooling influence   worldwide each year  aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths  aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries  but it is not yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified 
chemical pollution  
some chemicals  such as  
and   have potentially irreversible
and synergic effects on biological organisms  reducing fertility and resulting in permanent genetic damage  sublethal uptakes are drastically reducing marine bird and mammal populations  this boundary seems important  although it is hard to quantify 
a bayesian emulator for persistent organic pollutants has been developed which can potentially be used to quantify the boundaries for chemical pollution  to date  critical exposure levels of polychlorinated biphenyls  pcbs  above which mass mortality events of marine mammals are likely to occur  have been proposed as a chemical pollution planetary boundary 
interaction among boundaries  
the boundary values above were set on the assumption that interactions are not occurring if other boundaries are being crossed  however  a given planetary boundary may interact in a manner that changes the safe operating level of other boundaries  rockstrm et al  did not analyze such interactions  but they suggested that many of these interactions will reduce rather than expand the proposed boundary levels 
for example  the
boundary could shift downward if the freshwater boundary is breached  causing lands to become arid and unavailable for agriculture  at a regional level  water resources may decline in asia if
continues in the   such considerations suggest the need for  extreme caution in approaching or transgressing any individual planetary boundaries  
another example has to do with
and   in 2009 
showed that  since 1990  calcification in the reefs of the
that they examined decreased at a rate unprecedented over the last 400 years  14  in less than 20 years   their evidence suggests that the increasing temperature stress and the declining ocean saturation state of
is making it difficult for reef corals to deposit calcium carbonate 
explored how multiple stressors  such as increased nutrient loads and   move corals into less desirable ecosystem states 
showed that ocean acidification will significantly change the distribution and abundance of a whole range of marine life  particularly species  that build skeletons  shells  and tests of biogenic calcium carbonate   increasing temperatures  surface
levels and ocean acidity all stress marine   and the combination of these stresses may well cause perturbations in the abundance and diversity of marine biological systems that go well beyond the effects of a single stressor acting alone  
subsequent developments  
the concept of planetary boundaries challenges the belief that resources are either limitless or infinitely substitutable  it threatens the business-as-usual approach to economic growth  the fact that reference to planetary boundaries was excluded from the  
  conference statement is a counterintuitive sign that the concept is being taken very seriously and has indeed gained enough traction to be threatening to the status quo  had planetary boundaries remained in the statement  the most credible interpretation is that they would join a growing list of nice-sounding goals that are included but never achieved in the end  planetary boundaries will not go away  the intrinsic limits to the amount of resources and environmental services that humanity can extract safely from the earth system cannot be eliminated by wishful thinking  denial  or omission from official sustainable development conference statements  it is simply the nature of the planet we inhabit 

the doughnut  
in 2012 kate raworth from
noted the rockstrom concept does not take human population growth into account  she suggested social boundaries should be incorporated into the planetary boundary structure  such as jobs  education  food  access to water  health services and energy  there is a need to accommodate an environmentally safe space compatible with  poverty eradication and rights for all   within planetary limits and an equitable social foundation lies a doughnut shaped area which is the area where there is a  safe and just space for humanity to thrive in 
tenth boundary  
also in 2012 
suggested a tenth boundary  the annual net global
of all   as an easily determinable measure integrating many variables that will give  a clear signal about the health of ecosystems  
united nations endorsement  
the united nations secretary general
endorsed the concept of planetary boundaries on 16 march 2012  when he presented the key points of the report of his high level panel on global sustainability to an informal
of the un general assembly  ban stated   the panels vision is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality  to make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable  while combating climate change and respecting a range of other planetary boundaries   the concept was incorporated into the so-called  zero draft  of the outcome of the
to be convened in rio de janeiro 2022 june 2012  however  the use of the concept was subsequently withdrawn from the text of the conference   partly due to concerns from some poorer countries that its adoption could lead to the sidelining of poverty reduction and economic development  it is also  say observers  because the idea is simply too new to be officially adopted  and needed to be challenged  weathered and chewed over to test its robustness before standing a chance of being internationally accepted at un negotiations  
2015 update  
the planetary boundary framework was updated in 2015  it was suggested that three of the boundaries  including climate change  might push the earth system into a new state if crossed  these also strongly influence the remaining boundaries  in the paper  the framework is developed to make it more applicable at the regional scale
