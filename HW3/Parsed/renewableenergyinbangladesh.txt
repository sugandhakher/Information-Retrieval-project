renewable energy in bangladesh refers to the use of
to
in   the current renewable energy comes from    
and  
contents
solar power  
the long term average sunshine data indicates that the period of bright sunshine hours in the coastal regions of bangladesh varies from 3 to 11 hours daily  the
in bangladesh varies from 3.8 kwh m2 day to 6.4 kwh m2 day at an average of 5 kwh m2 day  these indicate that there are good prospects for
and
application in the country 
with an estimated 40  of the population in bangladesh having no access to electricity  the government introduced a scheme known as solar home systems  shs  to provide electricity to households with no grid access  the program reached 3 million households as of late 2014 and  with more than 50,000 systems being added per month since 2009  the world bank has called it  the fastest growing solar home system program in the world  
the bangladeshi government is working towards universal electricity access by 2021 with the shs program projected to cover 6 million households by 2017 
wind power  
the long term wind flow  especially in the islands and the southern coastal belt of bangladesh indicate that the average
remains between 3 and 4.5m s for the months of march to september and 1.7 to 2.3 for remaining period of the year  there is a good opportunity in island and coastal areas for the application of
for pumping and electrification  but during the summer and monsoon seasons  march to october  there can be very low pressure areas and storm wind speeds 200 to 300kmph can be expected 
have to be strong enough to withstand these high wind speeds 
tidal power  
the tides at
are predominantly semidiurnal with a large variation in range corresponding to the seasons  the maximum occurring during the south-west monsoon  in 1984  an attempt was made by mechanical engineering department of
to assess the feasibility of
in the coastal regions of bangladesh  especially at
and at the islands of
and   the average
was found within 4-5 meter and the
of the
exceeds even 6 meter  from different calculations  it is anticipated that there are a number of suitable sites at cox s bazar  maheshkhali  kutubdia and other places where permanent basins with pumping arrangements might be constructed which would be a double operation scheme 
wave energy  
bangladesh has favorable conditions for
especially during the period beginning from late march to early october  waves generated in
and a result of the southwestern wind is significant  maximum
of over 2 meter with an absolute maximum of 2.4 meter were recorded  the
varied from 3 to 4 seconds for waves of about 0.5 meter and about 6 seconds for waves of about 2 meter 
waste to electric energy  
in order to save the large cities from environment pollution  the
as well as
from the
programme is being taken by the government 
biogas  
there mainly two types of
used in bangladesh  floating dome type and fixed dome type  bag type plants are also used in the country but rarely
