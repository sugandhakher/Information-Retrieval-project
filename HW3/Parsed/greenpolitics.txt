green politics  also known as ecopolitics  is a
that aims to create an ecologically sustainable society rooted in       and   it began taking shape in the western world in the 1970s  since then green parties have developed and established themselves in many countries around the globe  and have achieved some electoral success 
the political term green was used initially in relation to
  for  the greens    a green party formed in the late 1970s  the term
is sometimes used in academic circles  but in the latter has come to represent an interdisciplinary field of study  the academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with
in topics such as degradation and marginalization  environmental conflict  conservation and control  and environmental identities and social movements 
supporters of green politics share many ideas with the         and   in addition to democracy and ecological issues  green politics is concerned with       sometimes variants of

in the political spectrum 
the green ideology has connections with various other ecocentric political ideologies  including     and   but to what extent these can be seen as forms of green politics is a matter of debate 
as the left-wing  green   i e  capital  g   political philosophy developed  there also came into separate existence unrelated and polar opposite movements on the right that include ecological components such as

history  
influences  
adherents to green politics tend to consider it to be part of a  higher  worldview and not simply a political ideology  green politics draws its ethical stance from a variety of sources  from the values of   to the ethics of  
and   these people influenced green thought in their advocacy of long-term    foresight  and on the personal responsibility of every individual to make moral choices 
of course  unease about adverse consequences of human actions on nature predates the modern concept of environmentalism   social commentators as far apart as ancient rome and china complained of air  water and noise pollution 
the philosophical roots of environmentalism can be traced back to enlightenment thinkers such as
in france and  later  the author and naturalist
in america  organised environmentalism began in late 19th century europe and the united states as a reaction to the
with its emphasis on unbridled economic expansion 
green politics first began as conservation and preservation movements  such as the   founded in san francisco in 1892 
left-green platforms of the form that make up the green parties today draw terminology from the science of ecology  and policy from                 and or   in the 1970s  as these movements grew in influence  green politics arose as a new philosophy which synthesized their goals  the green party political movement is not to be confused with the unrelated fact that in some far-right and fascist parties  nationalism has on occasion been tied into a sort of green politics which promotes environmentalism as a form of pride in the  motherland  according to a minority of authors 
early development  
german green party co-founder    with former german cabinet member  otto schily  at press conference in 1983 
in june 1970 in the
a group called
won 5 of the 45 seats on the
gemeenteraad  city council   as well as two seats each on councils in
and
and one seat apiece in  
and   the kabouters were an outgrowth of s environmental white plans and they proposed groene plannen  green plans  
the first political party to be created with its basis in environmental issues was the   founded in australia in march 1972 to fight against deforestation and the creation of a dam that would damage   whilst it only gained three percent in state elections  it had  according to derek wall   inspired the creation of green parties all over the world   in may 1972  a meeting at   new zealand  launched the   the world s first countrywide green party to contest parliamentary seats nationally  a year later in 1973  europe s first green party  the uk s   came into existence 
the german green party was not the first green party in europe to have members elected nationally but the impression was created that they had been  because they attracted the most media attention  the   contended in their first national election in 1980  they started as a provisional coalition of civic groups and political campaigns which  together  felt their interests were not expressed by the conventional parties  after contesting the 1979 euro elections they held a conference which identified
which all groups in the original alliance could agree as the basis of a common party platform  welding these groups together as a single party  this statement of principles has since been utilised by many green parties around the world  it was this party that first coined the term  green    grn  in german  and adopted the
symbol  in the   the greens won 27 seats in the  
further developments  
the first canadian foray into green politics took place in the maritimes when 11 independent candidates  including one in montreal and one in toronto  ran in the 1980 federal election under the banner of the small party  inspired by schumacher s small is beautiful  the small party candidates ran for the expressed purpose of putting forward an anti-nuclear platform in that election  it was not registered as an official party  but some participants in that effort went on to form the
in 1983  the
and
were also formed that year   current
leader
was the instigator and one of the candidates and she was eventually elected in  
in finland  in 1995  the
became the first european green party to form part of a state-level cabinet  the german greens followed  forming a government with the
 the     from 1998 to 2005  in 2001  they reached an agreement to end reliance on
in germany  and agreed to remain in coalition and support the german government of chancellor
in the   this put them at odds with many greens worldwide  but demonstrated that they were capable of difficult political tradeoffs 
in latvia    leader of the green party and part of the   an alliance of a nordic agrarian party and the green party  was
for ten months in 2004  making him the first
politician to lead a country in the history of the world  in 2015  emsis  party colleague    was elected president of latvia by the latvian parliament  vjonis became the first green
worldwide 
in the german state of baden-wrttenburg  the green party became the leader of the coalition with the social democrats after finishing second in the   in the following   the green party became the strongest party for the first time in a german  
in 2016  the former leader of the austrian green party  1997-2008     officially running as an independent  won the   making him the second green head of state worldwide  the first directly elected by popular vote  van der bellen became second in the election s first round with 21.3  of the votes  the best result for the austrian greens in their history  he won the second round run-off against the far-right freedom party s
with 50.3  of the votes  making him the first president of austria who was not backed by either the people s or the social democratic party 
core tenets  
according to   a prominent british green proponent  there are four pillars that define green politics 
in 1984  the
in the united states expanded the four pillars into ten key values which  in addition to the four pillars mentioned above  include 
post-patriarchal values  later translated to  
global responsibility
future focus
in 2001  the
were organized as an international green movement  the
identified six guiding principles 
ecological wisdom
social justice
nonviolence
respect for diversity
ecology  
economics  
main article 
green economics focuses on the importance of the health of the
to   consequently  most greens distrust conventional capitalism  as it tends to emphasize
while ignoring ecological health  the    of economic growth often includes damage to the biosphere  which is unacceptable according to green politics  green economics considers such growth to be    material increase that nonetheless lowers overall quality of life 
some greens refer to  
and    as  grey   as contrasted with  green   economic views   grey  implies age  concrete  and lifelessness 
therefore  adherents to green politics advocate economic policies designed to safeguard the environment  greens want governments to stop
companies that waste resources or pollute the natural world  subsidies that greens refer to as     some currents of green politics place automobile and agribusiness subsidies in this category  as they may harm human health  on the contrary  greens look to a
that are seen to encourage both producers and consumers to make ecologically friendly choices 
green economics is on the whole   according to greens 
is considered a threat to well-being  which will replace natural environments and local cultures with a single trade economy  termed the  
since green economics emphasizes biospheric health  an issue outside the traditional left-right spectrum  different currents within green politics incorporate ideas from socialism and capitalism  greens on the left are often identified as   who merge ecology and environmentalism with socialism and
and blame the capitalist system for environmental degradation  social injustice  inequality and conflict    on the other hand  believe that the
system  with some modification  is capable of addressing ecological problems  this belief is documented in the business experiences of eco-capitalists in the book  the gort cloud that describes the
as the green community that supports eco-friendly businesses 
participatory democracy  
since the beginning  green politics has emphasized local  -level political activity and decision-making  according to its adherents  it is crucial that citizens play a direct role in the decisions that influence their lives and their environment  therefore  green politics seeks to increase the role of   based on direct citizen involvement and   wherever it is feasible 
green politics also encourages political action on the individual level  such as   or buying things that are made according to environmentally ethical standards  indeed  many green parties emphasize individual and grassroots action at the local and regional levels over   historically  green parties have grown at the local level  gradually gaining influence and spreading to regional or provincial politics  only entering the national arena when there is a strong network of local support 
in addition  many greens believe that governments should not levy taxes against strictly local production and trade  some greens advocate new ways of organizing authority to increase local control  including
and  
other issues  
the
is an internationally recognized symbol of green politics 
green politics on the whole is
and the buildup of   supporting adherence to the   by which technologies are rejected unless they can be proven to not cause significant harm to the health of living things or the  
in the spirit of nonviolence  green politics opposes the
and the curtailment of   focusing instead on nurturing
in war-torn regions and the construction of a
with an increased role for women 
in europe  green parties tend to support the creation of a democratic  
although greens in the
 call for an end to the     and  for decriminalization of    they also call for developing  a firm approach to law enforcement that directly addresses violent crime  including trafficking in hard drugs  
green platforms generally favor tariffs on   restricting   and protections for
or   in keeping with their commitment to the preservation of diversity  greens are often committed to the maintenance and protection of indigenous communities  languages  and traditions  an example of this is the  s commitment to the preservation of the irish language 
some of the green movement has focused on divesting in fossil fuels 
states  it is paradoxical for universities to remain invested in fossil fuel companies  
says that the fossil fuel divestment movement can increase political pressure at events like the international climate change conference  cop   alex epstein of forbes notes that it is hypocritical to ask for divestment without a boycott and that a boycott would be more effective  some institutions that are leading by example in the academic area are    
and over 20 more  a number of cities  counties and religious institutions have also joined the movement to divest 
organization  
local movements  
green ideology emphasizes
and the principle of     as such  the ideal green party is thought to grow from the bottom up  from neighborhood to municipal to  eco- regional to national levels  the goal is to rule by a
process 
strong local coalitions are considered a pre-requisite to higher-level electoral breakthroughs  historically  the growth of green parties has been sparked by a single issue where greens can appeal to ordinary citizens  concerns  in germany  for example  the greens  early opposition to nuclear power won them their first successes in the federal elections 
global organization  
there is a growing level of global cooperation between green parties  global gatherings of green parties now happen  the first planetary meeting of greens was held 3031 may 1992  in rio de janeiro  immediately preceding the
held there  more than 200 greens from 28 nations attended  the first formal global greens gathering took place in   in 2001  with more than 800 greens from 72 countries in attendance  the second global green congress was held in so paulo  brazil  in may 2008  when 75 parties were represented 
global green networking dates back to 1990  following the planetary meeting of greens in   a global green steering committee was created  consisting of two seats for each continent  in 1993 this global steering committee met in mexico city and authorized the creation of a
including a     and   the directory was issued in several editions in the next years  in 1996  69 green parties from around the world signed a common declaration opposing french nuclear testing in the south pacific  the first statement of global greens on a current issue  a second statement was issued in december 1997  concerning the kyoto climate change treaty 
at the 2001 canberra global gathering delegates for green parties from 72 countries decided upon a
which proposes six key principles  over time  each green party can discuss this and organize itself to approve it  some by using it in the local press  some by translating it for their web site  some by incorporating it into their manifesto  some by incorporating it into their constitution  this process is taking place gradually  with online dialogue enabling parties to say where they are up to with this process 
the gatherings also agree on organizational matters  the first gathering voted unanimously to set up the global green network  ggn   the ggn is composed of three representatives from each green party  a companion organization was set up by the same resolution  global green coordination  ggc   this is composed of three representatives from each federation  africa  europe  the americas  asia pacific  see below   discussion of the planned organization took place in several green parties prior to the canberra meeting  the ggc communicates chiefly by email  any agreement by it has to be by unanimity of its members  it may identify possible global campaigns to propose to green parties worldwide  the ggc may endorse statements by individual green parties  for example  it endorsed a statement by the us green party on the israel-palestine conflict 
thirdly  global green gatherings are an opportunity for informal networking  from which joint campaigning may arise  for example  a campaign to protect the
coral reef  by getting it nominated for world heritage status  a joint campaign by the new caledonia green party  new caldonian indigenous leaders  the   and the   another example concerns   the leader of the green party in   the green oxygen party     ingrid betancourt and the party s campaign manager  claire rojas  were kidnapped by a hard-line faction of
on 7 march 2002  while travelling in farc-controlled territory  betancourt had spoken at the canberra gathering  making many friends  as a result  green parties all over the world have organized  pressing their governments to bring pressure to bear  for example  green parties in african countries  austria  canada  brazil  peru  mexico  france  scotland  sweden and other countries have launched campaigns calling for betancourt s release    the leader of the   went to colombia  as did an envoy from the european federation    who issued a report  the four federations of green parties issued a message to farc  ingrid betancourt was rescued by the colombian military in
in 2008 
global green meetings  
separately from the global green gatherings  global green meetings take place  for instance  one took place on the fringe of the
in johannesburg  green parties attended from australia  taiwan  korea  south africa  mauritius  uganda  cameroon  republic of cyprus  italy  france  belgium  germany  finland  sweden  norway  the usa  mexico and chile 
the global green meeting discussed the situation of green parties on the african continent  heard a report from   former mayor of   about setting up a web site of the ggn  discussed procedures for the better working of the ggc  and decided two topics on which the global greens could issue statements in the near future  iraq and the 2003 wto meeting in cancun 
green federations  
the member parties of the
are organised into four continental federations 
the european federation of green parties formed itself as the
on 22 february 2004  in the run-up to
elections in june 2004  a further step in trans-national integration 
currents  
green politics is usually said to include the        
movements  and   although these often claim not to be aligned with any party  some claim it also includes  
and the
movements  some greens support policy measures to empower women  especially mothers  to oppose war  de-escalate conflicts  and stop proliferating technologies useful in conflict or likely to lead to conflict  and  
greens on the
adhere to   an ideology that combines ecology  environmentalism  socialism  and
to criticize the capitalist system as the cause of ecological crises  social exclusion  inequality  and conflict  green parties are not eco-socialist  but some green parties around the world have or have had a significant eco-socialist membership   
despite this stereotype  some
greens may subscribe to a more
or
philosophy emphasizing individual
and  and
away from value created by labor or service and charging instead for human consumption of the wealth created by the natural world  see
and   
greens may view the processes by which living beings compete for mates  homes  and food  ecology  and the cognitive and political sciences very differently  these differences tend to drive debate on ethics  formation of policy  and the public resolution of these differences in leadership races  there is no single  green ethic
