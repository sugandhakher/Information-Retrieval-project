fuel consumption monitor from a 2006
a 1916 experiment in creating a fuel-saving automobile in the united states  the vehicle weighed only 135 pounds  61.2kg  and was an adaptation of a small gasoline engine originally designed to power a bicycle 
the fuel economy of an automobile is the
relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of
consumed by the vehicle  consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance  or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed  since fuel consumption of vehicles is a significant factor in air pollution  and since importation of motor fuel can be a large part of a nation s foreign trade  many countries impose requirements for fuel economy  different measurement cycles are used to approximate the actual performance of the vehicle  the energy in fuel is required to overcome various losses  wind resistance  tire drag  and others  in propelling the vehicle  and in providing power to vehicle systems such as ignition or air conditioning  various measures can be taken to reduce losses at each of the conversions between chemical energy in fuel and kinetic energy of the vehicle  driver behavior can affect fuel economy  maneuvers such as sudden acceleration and heavy braking waste energy 
electric cars do not directly burn fuel  and so do not have fuel economy per se  but equivalence measures  such as
have been created to attempt to compare them

fuel economy is the relationship between the distance traveled and fuel consumed 
fuel economy can be expressed in two ways 
units of fuel per fixed distance
generally expressed as liters per 100 kilometers  l 100km   used in most european countries  china  south africa  australia and new zealand  british and canadian law allow for the use of either liters per 100 kilometers or miles per imperial   recently  the
on new us cars has started displaying the vehicle s fuel consumption in us gallons per 100 miles 
units of distance per fixed fuel unit
per
 mpg  is commonly used in the united states  the united kingdom  and canada  alongside l 100km   kilometers per liter  km l  is more commonly used elsewhere in the americas  continental europe  asia  parts of africa and oceania  in arab countries km 20l which is known as kilometers per tanaka  or tanakeh  is used  where tanaka is a metal container which has a volume of 20 liters  both mpg and km l are units of distance per fixed fuel amount  the increase of the value represents economic fuel consumption  whereas l 100km is a unit of fuel consumption per a fixed unit of distance  the increase of the value represents large bad fuel consumption   when the mpg unit is used  it is necessary to identify the type of gallon used  as the imperial gallon is 4.5 liters and the us gallon is 3.785 liters

fuel economy statistics  
while the
 mechanical output to chemical energy in fuel  of petroleum
has increased since the beginning of the
to around 20-30   this is not the only factor in fuel economy  the design of automobile as a whole and usage pattern affects the fuel economy  published fuel economy is subject to variation between jurisdiction due to variations in testing protocols 
the average fuel economy for new passenger car in the united states rose from 17 mpg in 1978 to more than 22 mpg in 1982  the average fuel economy in 2008 for new cars  light trucks and suvs in the united states was 26.4 mpgus  8.9 l 100km   2008 model year cars classified as  midsize  by the us epa ranged from 11 to 46 mpgus 21 to 5 l 100km  however  due to environmental concerns caused by co2 emissions  new eu regulations are being introduced to reduce the average emissions of cars sold beginning in 2012  to 130 g km of co2  equivalent to 4.5 l 100km  52 mpgus  63 mpgimp  for a diesel-fueled car  and 5.0 l 100km  47 mpgus  56 mpgimp  for a gasoline  petrol -fueled car 
the average consumption across the fleet is not immediately affected by the new vehicle fuel economy  for example  australia s car fleet average in 2004 was 11.5 l 100km  20.5 mpgus   compared with the average new car consumption in the same year of 9.3 l 100km  25.3 mpgus 
speed and fuel economy studies  
1997 fuel economy statistics for various us models
fuel economy at steady speeds with selected vehicles was studied in 2010  the most recent study indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds than earlier studies  for example  some vehicles achieve better fuel economy at 100km h  62mph  rather than at 70km h  43mph   although not their best economy  such as the 1994 oldsmobile cutlass  which has its best economy at 90 kilometres per hour  56mph   8.1l 100km  29mpg-us    and gets 2 mpg better economy at 105km h  65mph  than at 72km h  45mph   9.4l 100km  25mpg-us  vs 22mpg-us  11l 100km    the proportion of driving on
varies from 4  in ireland to 41  in the  
when the us  s 55mph  89km h  speed limit was mandated  there were complaints that fuel economy could decrease instead of increase  the 1997 toyota celica got 1 mpg better fuel-efficiency at 105km h  65mph  than it did at 65km h  40mph   5.41l 100km  43.5mpg-us  vs 5.53l 100km  42.5mpg-us    although almost 5 mpg better at 60mph  97km h  than at 65mph  105km h   48.4mpg-us  4.86l 100km  vs 43.5mpg-us  5.41l 100km    and its best economy  52.6mpg-us  4.47l 100km   at only 25mph  40km h   other vehicles tested had from 1.4 to 20.2  better fuel-efficiency at 90km h  56mph  vs  105km h  65mph   their best economy was reached at speeds of 40 to 90km h  25 to 56mph   see graph  
officials hoped that the 55mph  90km h  limit  combined with a ban on ornamental lighting  no gasoline sales on sunday  and a 15  cut in gasoline production  would reduce total gas consumption by 200,000 barrels a day  representing a 2.2  drop from annualized 1973 gasoline consumption levels  this was partly based on a belief that cars achieve maximum efficiency between 65 and 80km h  40 and 50mph  and that trucks and buses were most efficient at 55mph  89km h  
in 1998  the u s 
footnoted an estimate that the 1974 national maximum speed limit  nmsl  reduced fuel consumption by 0.2 to 1.0 percent  rural interstates  the roads most visibly affected by the nmsl  accounted for 9.5  of the u s  vehicle-miles-traveled in 1973  but such free-flowing roads typically provide more fuel-efficient travel than conventional roads

energy considerations  
this section needs expansion  you can help by    june 2007 
since the total force opposing the vehicle s motion  at constant speed  multiplied by the distance through which the vehicle travels represents the work that the vehicle s engine must perform  the study of fuel economy  the amount of energy consumed per unit of distance traveled  requires a detailed analysis of the forces that oppose a vehicle s motion  in terms of physics  force   rate at which the amount of work generated  energy delivered  varies with the distance traveled  or

note  the amount of work generated by the vehicle s power source  energy delivered by the engine  would be exactly proportional to the amount of fuel energy consumed by the engine if the engine s efficiency is the same regardless of power output  but this is not necessarily the case due to the operating characteristics of the internal combustion engine 
for a vehicle whose source of power is a heat engine  an engine that uses heat to perform useful work   the amount of fuel energy that a vehicle consumes per unit of distance  level road  depends upon 
the  
the forces of friction within the mechanical system that delivers engine output to the wheels 
the forces of friction in the wheels and between the road and the wheels  rolling friction  
other internal forces that the engine works against  electrical generator  air conditioner  water pump  engine fan  etc

non-regenerative braking force  brakes that turn motion energy into heat rather than storing it in a useful form  e g   electrical energy in hybrid vehicles

energy dissipation in city and highway driving 
ideally  a car traveling at a constant velocity on level ground in a vacuum with frictionless wheels could travel at any speed without consuming any energy beyond what is needed to get the car up to speed  less ideally  any vehicle must expend energy on overcoming road load forces  which consist of aerodynamic drag  tire rolling resistance  and inertial energy that is lost when the vehicle is decelerated by friction brakes  with ideal   the inertial energy could be completely recovered  but there are few options for reducing aerodynamic drag or rolling resistance other than optimizing the vehicle s shape and the tire design  road load energy  or the energy demanded at the wheels  can be calculated by evaluating the vehicle equation of motion over a specific driving cycle  the vehicle powertrain must then provide this minimum energy in order to move the vehicle  and will lose a large amount of additional energy in the process of converting fuel energy into work and transmitting it to the wheels  overall  the sources of energy loss in moving a vehicle may be summarized as follows 
 20-30    which varies with engine type  the mass of the automobile and its load  and engine speed  usually measured in   
force  which increases roughly by the   but note that  
 
braking  although
captures some of the energy that would otherwise be lost 
losses in the  
can be up to 94  efficient whereas older
may be as low as 70  efficient automatically controlled shifting of gearboxes that have the same internals as manual boxes will give the same efficiency as a pure manual gearbox plus the bonus of added intelligence selecting optimal shifting points
air conditioning  the power required for the engine to turn the compressor decreases the fuel-efficiency  though only when in use  this may be offset by the reduced drag of the vehicle compared with driving with the windows down  the efficiency of ac systems gradually deteriorates due to dirty filters etc   regular maintenance prevents this  the extra mass of the air conditioning system will cause a slight increase in fuel consumption 
power steering  older hydraulic power steering systems are powered by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine  power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency  more modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed  this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered hydraulic pump 
cooling  older cooling systems used a constantly engaged mechanical fan to draw air through the radiator at a rate directly related to the engine speed  this constant load reduces efficiency  more modern systems use electrical fans to draw additional air through the radiator when extra cooling is required 
electrical systems  headlights  battery charging  active suspension  circulating fans  defrosters  media systems  speakers  and other electronics can also significantly increase fuel consumption  as the energy to power these devices causes increased load on the alternator  since alternators are commonly only 4060  efficient  the added load from electronics on the engine can be as high as 3 horsepower  2.2kw  at any speed including idle  in the ftp 75 cycle test  a 200 watt load on the alternator reduces fuel efficiency by 1.7mpg  headlights  for example  consume 110 watts on low and up to 240 watts on high  these electrical loads can cause much of the discrepancy between real world and epa tests  which only include the electrical loads required to run the engine and basic climate control 
standby  the energy needed to keep the engine running while it is not providing power to the wheels  i e   when stopped  coasting or braking 
fuel-efficiency decreases from electrical loads are most pronounced at lower speeds because most electrical loads are constant while engine load increases with speed  so at a lower speed a higher proportion of engine horsepower is used by electrical loads  hybrid cars see the greatest effect on fuel-efficiency from electrical loads because of this proportional effect

many
exist that are purported to increase fuel economy  many of these claims have been discredited  in the united states  the environmental protection agency maintains a list of devices that have been tested by independent laboratories and makes the test results available to the public 
fuel economy data reliability  
the mandatory publication of the fuel consumption by the manufacturer led some to use dubious practices to reach better values in the past  if the test is on a test stand  the vehicle may detect open doors and adapt the engine control  also when driven according to the test regime  the parameters may adapt automatically  test laboratories use a  golden car  that is tested in each one to check that each lab produces the same set of measurements for a given drive cycle 
tire pressures and lubricants have to be as recommended by the manufacturer  higher tire pressures are required on a particular   but this is to compensate for the different rolling resistance of the dynamometer  not to produce an unrealistic load on the vehicle   normally the quoted figures a manufacturer publishes have to be proved by the relevant authority witnessing vehicle engine tests  some jurisdictions independently test emissions of vehicles in service  and as a final measure can force a recall of all of a particular type of vehicle if the customer vehicles do not fulfill manufacturers  claims within reasonable limits  the expense and bad publicity from such a recall encourages manufacturers to publish realistic figures  the us federal government retests 1015  of models   to make sure that the manufacturer s tests are accurate 
real world fuel consumption can vary greatly as they can be affected by many factors that have little to do with the vehicle  driving conditions  weather  traffic  temperature  driving style  hard braking  jack rabbit starts  and speeding  road conditions  paved vs gravel  smooth vs potholes  and things like carrying excess weight  roof racks  and fuel quality can all combine to dramatically increase fuel consumption  expecting to consistently perform in the face of so many variables is impossible as is the expectation for one set of numbers to encompass every driver and their personal circumstances 
the ratings are meant to provide a comparison  and are not a promise of actual performance 
concerns over epa estimates  
for many years critics had claimed that epa estimated fuel economy figures had been misleading  the primary arguments of the epa detractors were focused on the lack of real world testing  and the very limited scale  i e   city or highway  
partly as a response to these criticisms  the epa changed their fuel economy rating system in 2008 in an attempt to more adequately address these concerns  instead of testing simply in two presumed modes  the testing now covers 
faster speeds and acceleration
air conditioner use
colder outside temperatures
while the new epa standards may represent an improvement  real world user data may still be the best way to gather and collect accurate fuel economy information  as such the epa has also set up a
where drivers can enter and track their own real-world fuel economy numbers 
there are also a number of websites that attempt to track and report individual user fuel economy data through real-life driving  sites or publications such as    
and
offer this service and claim more accurate numbers than those listed by the epa 
fuel economy maximizing behaviors

australia also uses a star rating system  from one to five stars  that combines greenhouse gases with pollution  rating each from 0 to 10 with ten being best  to get 5 stars a combined score of 16 or better is needed  so a car with a 10 for economy  greenhouse  and a 6 for emission or 6 for economy and 10 for emission  or anything in between would get the highest 5 star rating  the lowest rated car is the
with automatic transmission  with one star  while the highest rated was the toyota prius hybrid  the fiat 500  fiat punto and fiat ritmo as well as the citroen c3 also received 5 stars  the greenhouse rating depends on the fuel economy and the type of fuel used  a greenhouse rating of 10 requires 60 or less grams of co2 per km  while a rating of zero is more than 440 g km co2  the highest greenhouse rating of any 2009 car listed is the toyota prius  with 106g km co2 and 4.4l 100km  64mpg-imp  53mpg-us   several other cars also received the same rating of 8.5 for greenhouse  the lowest rated was the ferrari 575 at 499g km co2 and 21.8l 100km  13.0mpg-imp  10.8mpg-us   the bentley also received a zero rating  at 465g km co2  the best fuel economy of any year is the 20042005   at 3.4l 100km  83mpg-imp  69mpg-us  
canada  
vehicle manufacturers follow a controlled laboratory testing procedure to generate the fuel consumption data that they submit to the government of canada  this controlled method of fuel consumption testing  including the use of standardized fuels  test cycles and calculations  is used instead of on-road driving to ensure that all vehicles are tested under identical conditions and that the results are consistent and repeatable 
selected test vehicles are run in for about 6,000km before testing  the vehicle is then mounted on a chassis dynamometer programmed to take into account the aerodynamic efficiency  weight and rolling resistance of the vehicle  a trained driver runs the vehicle through standardized driving cycles that simulate trips in the city and on the highway  fuel consumption ratings are derived from the emissions generated during the driving cycles 
the 5 cycle test 
1  the city test simulates urban driving in stop-and-go traffic with an average speed of 34km h and a top speed of 90km h  the test runs for approximately 31 minutes and includes 23 stops  the test begins from a cold engine start  which is similar to starting a vehicle after it has been parked overnight during the summer  the final phase of the test repeats the first eight minutes of the cycle but with a hot engine start  this simulates restarting a vehicle after it has been warmed up  driven and then stopped for a short time  over five minutes of test time are spent idling  to represent waiting at traffic lights  the ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20c and ends at 30c 
2  the highway test simulates a mixture of open highway and rural road driving  with an average speed of 78km h and a top speed of 97km h  the test runs for approximately 13 minutes and does not include any stops  the test begins from a hot engine start  the ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20c and ends at 30c 
3  in the cold temperature operation test  the same driving cycle is used as in the standard city test  except that the ambient temperature of the test cell is set to -7c 
4  in the air conditioning test  the ambient temperature of the test cell is raised to 35c  the vehicle s climate control system is then used to lower the internal cabin temperature  starting with a warm engine  the test averages 35km h and reaches a maximum speed of 88km h  five stops are included  with idling occurring 19  of the time 
5  the high speed quick acceleration test averages 78km h and reaches a top speed of 129km h  four stops are included and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 13.6km h per second  the engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used  the ambient temperature of the test cell is constantly 25c 
tests 1  3  4   5 are averaged to create the city driving fuel consumption rate

in the european union  passenger vehicles are commonly tested using two drive cycles  and corresponding fuel economies are reported as  urban  and  extra-urban   in litres per 100km and  in the uk  in miles per imperial gallon 
the urban economy is measured using the test cycle known as ece-15  first introduced in 1970 by ec directive 70/220 ewg and finalized by eec directive 90 c81/01 in 1999  it simulates a 4,052m  2.518mile  urban trip at an average speed of 18.7km h  11.6mph  and at a maximum speed of 50km h  31mph  
the extra-urban driving cycle or eudc lasts 400 seconds  6minutes 40 seconds  at an average speed 62.6km h  39mph  and a top speed of 120km h  74.6mph  
eu fuel consumption numbers are often considerably lower than corresponding us epa test results for the same vehicle  for example  the 2011

in the european union advertising has to show
 co2 -emission and fuel consumption data in a clear way as described in the uk statutory instrument 2004 no 1661  since september 2005 a colour-coded  green rating  sticker has been available in the uk  which rates fuel economy by co2 emissions  a     100 g km  b  100120  c  121150  d  151165  e  166185  f  186225  and g  226   depending on the type of fuel used  for gasoline a corresponds to about 4.1l 100km  69mpg-imp  57mpg-us  and g about 9.5l 100km  30mpg-imp  25mpg-us   ireland has a very similar label  but the ranges are slightly different  with a     120 g km  b  121140  c  141155  d  156170  e  171190  f  191225  and g  226  
in the uk the asa  advertising standards agency  have claimed that fuel consumption figures are misleading  often the case with european vehicles as the mpg  miles per gallon  figures that can be advertised are often not the same as  real world  driving 
the asa have said that car manufacturers can use cheats to prepare their vehicles for their compulsory fuel efficiency and emissions tests in a way set out to make themselves look as clean as possible  this practice is common in petrol and diesel vehicle tests  but hybrid and electric vehicles are not immune as manufacturers apply these techniques to fuel efficiency 
car experts   also assert that the official mpg figures given by manufacturers do not represent the true mpg values from real-world driving  websites have been set up to show the real-world mpg figures  based on crowd-sourced data from real users  vs the official mpg figures 
the major loopholes in the current eu tests allow car manufacturers a number of cheats to improve results  car manufacturers can 
disconnect the alternator  thus no energy is used to recharge the battery 
use special lubricants that are not used in production cars  in order to reduce friction 
turn off all electrical gadgets i e  air con radio 
adjust brakes or even disconnect them to reduce friction 
tape up cracks between body panels and windows to reduce air resistance 
remove wing mirrors 
according to the results of a 2014 study by the international council on clean transportation  icct   the gap between official and real-world fuel-economy figures in europe has risen to about 38  in 2013 from 10  in 2001  the analysis found that for private cars  the difference between on-road and official co2 values rose from around 8  in 2001 to 31  in 2013  and 45  for company cars in 2013  the report is based on data from more than half a million private and company vehicles across europe  the analysis was prepared by the icct together with the
 tno   and the german institut fr energie- und umweltforschung heidelberg  ifeu  
japan  
the evaluation criteria used in japan reflects driving conditions commonly found  as the typical japanese driver doesn t drive as fast as other regions internationally   
1015 mode  
the 1015 mode
test is the official fuel economy and emission certification test for new light duty vehicles in japan  fuel economy is expressed in km l  kilometers per litre  and emissions are expressed in g km  the test is carried out on a
and consist of 25 tests which cover idling  acceleration  steady running and deceleration  and simulate typical japanese urban and or expressway driving conditions  the running pattern begins with a warm start  lasts for 660 seconds  11 minutes  and runs at speeds up to 70km h  43.5mph   the distance of the cycle is 6.34km  3.9mi   average speed of 25.6km h  15.9mph   and duration 892 seconds  14.9 minutes   including the initial 15 mode segment 
jc08  
a new more demanding test  called the jc08  was established in december 2006 for japans new standard that goes into effect in 2015  but it is already being used by several car manufacturers for new cars  the jc08 test is significantly longer and more rigorous than the 1015 mode test  the running pattern with jc08 stretches out to 1200 seconds  20 minutes   and there are both cold and warm start measurements and top speed is 82km h  51.0mph   the economy ratings of the jc08 are lower than the 1015 mode cycle  but they are expected to be more real world  the
became the first car to meet japans new 2015 fuel economy standards measured under the jc08 test 
new zealand  
starting on 7 april 2008 all cars of up to 3.5 tonnes gvw sold other than private sale need to have a fuel economy sticker applied  if available  that shows the rating from one half star to six stars with the most economic cars having the most stars and the more fuel hungry cars the least  along with the fuel economy in l 100km and the estimated annual fuel cost for driving 14,000km  at present fuel prices   the stickers must also appear on vehicles to be leased for more than 4months  all new cars currently rated range from 6.9l 100km  41mpg-imp  34mpg-us  to 3.8l 100km  74mpg-imp  62mpg-us  and received respectively from 4.5 to 5.5 stars 
united states  
motor vehicle fuel economy from 1966 to 2008 
us energy tax act  
main article 
the
of 1978 in the us established a gas guzzler tax on the sale of new model year vehicles whose fuel economy fails to meet certain statutory levels  the tax applies only to cars  not trucks  and is collected by the   its purpose is to discourage the production and purchase of fuel-inefficient vehicles  the tax was phased in over ten years with rates increasing over time  it applies only to manufacturers and importers of vehicles  although presumably some or all of the tax is passed along to automobile consumers in the form of higher prices  only new vehicles are subject to the tax  so no tax is imposed on used car sales  the tax is graduated to apply a higher tax rate for less-fuel-efficient vehicles  to determine the tax rate  manufacturers test all the vehicles at their laboratories for fuel economy  the us
confirms a portion of those tests at an epa lab 
in some cases  this tax may only apply to certain variants of a given model  for example  the 20042006
 captive import version of the   did incur the tax when ordered with the four-speed automatic transmission  but did not incur the tax when ordered with the six-speed manual transmission 
epa testing procedure through 2007  
the  city  or urban dynamometer driving schedule  udds  used in the epa federal test procedure
the highway fuel economy driving cycle  hwfet  used in the epa federal test procedure
two separate fuel economy tests simulate city driving and highway driving  the  city  driving program or urban dynamometer driving schedule or  udds  or
is defined in
and consists of starting with a cold engine and making 23 stops over a period of 31minutes for an average speed of 20mph  32km h  and with a top speed of 56mph  90km h  
the  highway  program or highway fuel economy driving schedule  hwfet  is defined in
and uses a warmed-up engine and makes no stops  averaging 48mph  77km h  with a top speed of 60mph  97km h  over a 10-mile  16km  distance  the measurements are then adjusted downward by 10   city  and 22   highway  to more accurately reflect real-world results  a weight average of city  55   and highway  45   fuel economies is used to determine the guzzler tax 
the procedure has been updated to   adding a  hot start  cycle which repeats the  cold start  cycle after a 10-minute pause 
because epa figures had almost always indicated better efficiency than real-world fuel-efficiency  the epa has modified the method starting with 2008  updated estimates are available for vehicles back to the 1985 model year 
epa testing procedure  2008 and beyond  
2008
highlights fuel economy 
us epa altered the testing procedure effective my2008 which adds three new
 sftp  tests to include the influence of higher driving speed  harder acceleration  colder temperature and air conditioning use 
sftp us06 is a high speed quick acceleration loop that lasts 10minutes  covers 8 miles  13km   averages 48mph  77km h  and reaches a top speed of 80mph  130km h   four stops are included  and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 8.46mph  13.62km h  per second  the engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used  ambient temperature varies between 68f  20c  to 86f  30c  
sfto sc03 is the air conditioning test  which raises ambient temperatures to 95f  35c   and puts the vehicle s climate control system to use  lasting 9.9minutes  the 3.6-mile  5.8km  loop averages 22mph  35km h  and maximizes at a rate of 54.8mph  88.2km h   five stops are included  idling occurs 19 percent of the time and acceleration of 5.1mph sec is achieved  engine temperatures begin warm 
lastly  a cold temperature cycle uses the same parameters as the current city loop  except that ambient temperature is set to 20f  7c  
epa tests for fuel economy do not include electrical load tests beyond climate control  which may account for some of the discrepancy between epa and real world fuel-efficiency  a 200w electrical load can produce a 0.4km l  0.94mpg  reduction in efficiency on the ftp 75 cycle test 
electric vehicles and hybrids  
2010
for a
showing fuel economy in
and gas-only mode 
following the efficiency claims made for vehicles such as
and   the
recommended to use epa s new vehicle fuel efficiency formula that gives different values depending on fuel used  in november 2010 the epa introduced the first fuel economy ratings in the
for  
for the fuel economy label of the chevy volt
epa rated the car separately for
expressed in
 mpg-e  and for gasoline-only mode expressed in conventional miles per gallon  epa also estimated an overall combined city highway gas-electricity fuel economy rating expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent  mpg-e   the label also includes a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios  30 miles  48km   45 miles  72km   60 miles  97km  and 75 miles  121km  driven between a full charge  and a never charge scenario  this information was included in order to make the consumers aware of the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges  also the fuel economy for a gasoline-only scenario  never charge  was included  for electric-only mode the energy consumption estimated in
per 100 miles  160km  is also shown 
2010
showing the epa s combined city highway
for an all-
for the fuel economy label of the nissan leaf
epa rated the combined fuel economy in terms of   with a separate rating for city and highway driving  this fuel economy equivalence is based on the energy consumption estimated in
per 100 miles  and also shown in the monroney label 
in may 2011  the
 nhtsa  and epa issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a
that is mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with
2013  and voluntary for 2012 models  the ruling includes new labels for
and
vehicles available in the us market  such as         and   the common fuel economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional
vehicles is
 mpge   a gallon of gasoline equivalent means the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity  cubic feet of
 cng   or kilograms of
that is equal to the energy in a gallon of gasoline 
the new labels also include for the first time an estimate of how much fuel or electricity it takes to drive 100 miles  160km   providing us consumers with fuel consumption per distance traveled  the metric commonly used in many other countries  epa explained that the objective is to avoid the traditional miles per gallon metric that can be potentially misleading when consumers compare fuel economy improvements  and known as the  mpg illusion   this illusion arises because the reciprocal  i e  non-linear  relationship between cost  equivalently  volume of fuel consumed  per unit distance driven and mpg value means that differences in mpg values are not directly meaningful  only ratios are  in mathematical terms  the reciprocal function does not commute with addition and subtraction  in general  a difference in reciprocal values is not equal to the reciprocal of their difference   it has been claimed that many consumers are unaware of this  and therefore compare mpg values by subtracting them  which can give a misleading picture of relative differences in fuel economy between different pairs of vehicles  for instance  an increase from 10 to 20 mpg corresponds to a 100  improvement in fuel economy  whereas an increase from 50 to 60 mpg is only a 20  improvement  although in both cases the difference is 10 mpg  the epa explained that the new gallons-per-100-miles metric provides a more accurate measure of fuel efficiency  notably  it is equivalent to the normal metric measurement of fuel economy  liters per 100 kilometers  l 100km  
cafe standards  
curve of average car mileage for model years between 1978-2014
main article 
the corporate average fuel economy  cafe  regulations in the united states  first enacted by congress in 1975  are federal regulations intended to improve the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks  trucks  vans and   sold in the us in the wake of the   historically  it is the sales-weighted average fuel economy of a manufacturer s
of current
passenger cars or light trucks  manufactured for sale in the united states  under truck cafe standards 20082011 this changes to a  footprint  model where larger trucks are allowed to consume more fuel  the standards were limited to vehicles under a certain weight  but those weight classes were expanded in 2011 
state regulations  
the states are pre-empted by federal law  and are not allowed to make fuel efficiency standards  however  california has a special dispensation from the clean air act to make emissions standards  which other states may adopt instead of the federal standards   the
is implementing some legislation that limits
emissions  a legal dispute has emerged over whether this is effectually a fuel efficiency standard
