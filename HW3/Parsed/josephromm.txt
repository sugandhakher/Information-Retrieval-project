service at the u s  department of energy  
forrestal building  headquarters of the
romm served as acting assistant secretary of the   in charge of the
during 1997 and as principal deputy assistant secretary from august 1995 through june 1998  and special assistant for policy and planning from 1993 to july 1995  this office  with an annual budget at the time of  1 billion and 550 employees  assists businesses in the industrial  utility  transportation and buildings sectors to develop and use

as principal deputy assistant secretary  romm was in charge of all policy and technology analysis and programmatic development for the office  which was then developing pem   microturbines  advanced     building controls 
and other renewables    and hydrogen production and storage  among other projects  he initiated  supervised  and publicized a comprehensive technical analysis in 1997 by five national laboratories of how energy technologies can best reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively  entitled scenarios of u s  carbon reductions 
1998 to 2006  
after leaving the department of energy  romm was the executive director and founder of the
center for energy and climate solutions  an organization based in the washington dc area that helped businesses and u s  states adopt high-leverage strategies for saving energy and cutting
and
emissions  he was also a principal of the capital e group  which consulted on
and sustainable design services for clean energy technologies  and sat on the advisory board of securing america s future energy  while at capital e group  romm was also a registered lobbyist  representing the interests of clients ion america and sunpower corp 
romm has written that hybrid cars  like the   and   are more effective in reducing greenhouse gases than  
during these years  romm wrote widely on global warming and energy technologies that can reduce global warming  his 2004 book    argues that putting off the implementation of current green technologies in favor of waiting for technological breakthroughs in
is a dangerous distraction that will delay urgently needed government action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions  the book was named one of the best science and technology books of 2004 by   in reviewing the book  daniel i  sperling  a member of  s   offered dissenting views  in 2004  romm also wrote the national commission on energy policy s report   the car and fuel of the future   which was rated the  1 hottest article on energy policy by   he was also the
for the
project  future directions for hydrogen energy research and education  2004   romm is interviewed in the 2006 documentary film   directed by
and narrated by   in the film  romm gives a presentation intended to show that the government s   initiative  was a bad policy choice and a distraction that was delaying the exploitation of more promising technologies  such as electric and
that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase america s   as of 2010  romm continued to view hydrogen as a  breakthrough technology illusion  
romm s 2006 book
projects that humans have a window of opportunity of only about a decade to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming  it calls upon americans to demand government action to encourage and require the use of current emission-cutting technologies    in his review of the book for   wrote   whereas the first third of romm s book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming  the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the u s  public is being misled by a federal government  backed by conservative political forces  that is intent on inaction  and that s also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions  
wrote that hell and high water  provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change  a sensible agenda for technology and policy  and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science  
climate progress and recent years  
since late 2006  romm has been a senior fellow at the   founding their climate blog    which focuses on climate science  policy and reporting  in 2008 
magazine named his blog one of the  top 15 green websites   writing that it  counters bad science and inane rhetoric with original analysis delivered sharply      romm occupies the intersection of climate science  economics and policy  resist temptation to lump him in with knee-jerk enviros  on his blog and in his december 2006 book    you can find some of the most cogent  memorable  and deployable arguments for immediate and overwhelming action to confront global warming   in 2010  time magazine wrote   viewing climate change through the prism of national security  romm analyzes breaking energy news and the relevant research  but most important  he challenges the beliefs and conclusions of the mainstream media on climate-change issues   as of 2016  romm continues to contribute to the site  romm also writes for other top internet energy and news sites  including         and   his july 2012
opinion piece was called  without carbon controls  we face a dust bowl  
romm has testified numerous times before congressional committees on energy and global warming issues  offering his views on government action to curb global warming  for example  in july 2012  he testified before a
of the
on the 2012 u s  drought and wildfires  in march of the same year  he testified before the
on the  the american energy initiative  and rising gasoline prices  in 2010  he testified before the
on how to optimize  energy tax incentives driving the green job economy   and in 2007  he testified before the house
on the subject of  fuels for the future   specifically the use of liquid fuel from coal  which he believes would accelerate global warming  he also lectures on energy technology 
and how the media portrays climate change 
romm s 2010 book    is  largely a selection of his best blog postings over the past few years related to climate change issues  
describes the book as  a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change  the media that so badly neglects it  the politicians who attempt to address it  and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore  the  science   and the clean energy solutions that could help get us out of the mess   in 2011  romm sat on the panel of the green car summit of the   his 2012 book  language intelligence  concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric 
commented on the book   joe masterfully     scripts ways to master the metaphor  and incorporate irony  solutions the reader can use for speeches  social media  or just winning the debate around the kitchen table   romm wrote an article for time magazine in august 2012 using the research from language intelligence to analyze whether
or
is the more effective communicator  in speeches and lectures since then  romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book  instead of their usual  technical  neutral style  to better explain the dangers of  and solutions to  climate change to lay people and the media 
romm is the chief science editor for the documentary tv series   about the impact of and solutions to climate change  the first season of the series ran in 2014 on the
network  he wrote  climate change 101  an introduction   for the series  website  a second season is scheduled to run in 2016 on the   the first season won the 2014
for outstanding documentary or nonfiction series  in 2015 
included romm as one of  the world s 25 most compelling voices  on climate in its series the climate 25  that year  romm also wrote the book climate change  what everyone needs to know  a primer on the topic  in q a format  ralph benko in
magazine wrote that the  impressive book     lucidly presents the case both for deep concern and optimism  
media comment and interviews  
romm is often cited  quoted or interviewed by journalists to explain the impact of public policy and energy technologies and applications on global warming and energy security  or to explain causes and impacts of climate change or the influence of the media  for example  in 2009 
relied on him to assess   and he was featured on
discussing the scientific evidence that    is not clean  in 2010  msnbc s
program interviewed romm on how the military is taking action on climate change to improve national security 
interviewed him on the science and politics of global warming 
asked him to comment on the -funded exhibit on evolution and climate change at the   and
and cbs news each reviewed a media call by romm concerning the relationship between the january 2010 snowstorms in washington  dc and global warming 
in 2011 
linked with approval to romm s review of the scientific literature on climate change  time magazine explored romm s critique of matthew nisbet and praised his analysis of the decline of media coverage regarding climate change 
quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public  the same year 
quoted romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies  and the
quoted him regarding president obama s 2011 state of the union address  in 2012 in the new york times  economist
cited romm on the connection between drought and climate change  and the atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the democrats to discuss climate change  national geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear  and  s
interviewed romm about record-breaking heat 
in 2014
quoted romm regarding the lack of commercial viability of hydrogen fuel cells for cars  and
quoted him concerning international cooperation on climate change  in 2015  the guardian quoted romm about historic high global temperatures  and
quoted him on actions that
might take concerning climate agreements if he were to be elected president  later that year 
interviewed him about nuclear power and climate change 
quoted romm in 2016 about the cost and pace of change in clean energy technology 
romm s views  
romm argues that rapid deployment of current carbon-reducing technologies is essential to
and preserve both the world economy and a comfortable climate 
 dot earth  column reviewed romm s views on global warming solutions on november 24  2008  including his belief that  to combat global warming  humans cannot wait for new technologies and scientific breakthroughs  that instead we must  deploy existing and near-term low-carbon technologies as fast as is humanly possible   in his blog  romm has described the technology solutions that he believes can control global warming  the new york times also quoted romm as stating that  to solve the climate crisis   we will need a wwii-style approach   the article noted romm s belief that  credible people  and the press should publicly support the notion that government action is needed to help solve the global warming crisis  in particular  the press should explain how current news stories  such as hurricanes  droughts and insect infestations are related to global warming 
according to u s  news   world report  romm believes that global warming  is advancing more swiftly than most people think and than the mainstream media usually report  he has called for significantly ramping up government spending on clean energy technology  halting the construction of new coal plants  rapidly increasing the use of energy-efficient technologies  and imposing a cap-and-trade system to sharply limit carbon dioxide emissions   in 2006  in a radio interview  romm stated   global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we live our lives  if we don t act pretty soon  in an intelligent fashion  then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate    global warming is the issue of the century   in march 2009  romm summarized and updated his views in an  introduction  to his blog  and in another post  setting forth a summary of  global warming impacts  
in 2011  romm stated that  feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century in the face of a rapidly worsening climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced   romm s 2010 book  straight up notes   the bottom line is that the economic cost of action is low  whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater   romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global gdp per year  he also asks in the book   will the united states be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies  or will we be importing them from europe  japan  and the likely clean energy leader in our absence  china   in 2005  with respect to the u s  congress s actions on climate  including its votes on the   romm told the guardian   future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse  
romm has been critical of media coverage of global warming  in his 2010 book    he wrote   historically  even the most respected newspapers have fallen into the trap of giving the same credence  and often the same amount of space  to a handful of u s  scientists  most receiving funds from the fossil fuel industry  as they give to hundreds of the world s leading climate scientists  no surprise that much of the public has ended up with a misimpression about the remarkable strength of our scientific understanding and the need for action   he concludes   more and more pieces are being written by senior political reporters  who know very little about global warming   romm also believes that scientists and politicians need to be more effective communicators about climate change 
reputation  
in 2008  romm was elected a fellow of the
for  distinguished service toward a sustainable energy future and for persuasive discourse on why citizens  corporations  and governments should adopt sustainable technologies   in 2009 
magazine named romm to its list of  100 people who are changing america   quoting journalist david roberts as follows   joe combines two qualities you don t often find together  a deep knowledge of technology  policy and science along with genuine moral passion   former

named romm s blog the  best politics website   adding   this is the art of blogging at its best   the uk s
ranked climate progress at the top of its list of blogs in its  top 50 twitter climate accounts to follow   reviewing romm s 2010 book straight up 
wrote that romm  knows his climate science      and  has been a persuasive voice for the most important truth about global warming  that it is a far worse problem than either politicians or the general public understand      romm has been consistent in insisting that we have much of the technology necessary to at least begin tackling the problem   he called romm  a tireless foil to the  right-wing disinformation machine  that has tried  with great success     to delay action by confusing and disheartening americans about global warming      it requires a thick skin to take on the daily task of dealing with the disinformers  but romm has the taste for this kind of blood sport  and the talent as well   in 2011  the new york times called romm  one of the countrys most influential writers on climate change   in 2012  planetsave wrote that romm is  considered the worlds best blogger on climate science  and politics related to it
