outdoor components of a residential air-source heat pump
a heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a  heat sink   heat pumps are designed to move
opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one  a heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink 
while

 heating  ventilating  and air conditioning  devices used for space heating or space cooling  when a heat pump is used for heating  it employs the same basic
used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator  but in the opposite direction - releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment  in this use  heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground  in heating mode  heat pumps are three to four times more efficient in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters  typically installed cost for a heat pump is about 20 times greater than for

overview  
main article 
in heating  ventilation and air conditioning    applications  the term heat pump usually refers to easily reversible
devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer 
spontaneously flows from warmer places to colder spaces  a heat pump can absorb heat from a cold space and release it to a warmer one   heat  is not conserved in this process  which requires some amount of external high grade  low-entropy  energy  such as electricity 
heat pumps are used to provide heating because less high-grade energy is required for their operation than appears in the released heat  most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment  and only a fraction comes from electricity  or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor   in electrically powered heat pumps  the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed  giving the system a coefficient of performance  cop  of 3 or 4  as opposed to a cop of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater  in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy 
heat pumps use a refrigerant as an intermediate fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes  in the evaporator  and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses  in the condenser  the refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser  allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances 
reversible heat pumps  
reversible heat pumps work in either thermal direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space  they employ a
to reverse the flow of refrigerant from the compressor through the condenser and evaporation coils 
in heating mode  the outdoor coil is an evaporator  while the indoor is a condenser  the refrigerant flowing from the evaporator  outdoor coil  carries the thermal energy from outside air  or soil  indoors  after the vapour temperature has been augmented by compressing it  the indoor coil then transfers thermal energy  including energy from the compression  to the indoor air  which is then moved around the inside of the building by an   alternatively  thermal energy is transferred to water  which is then used to heat the building via radiators or   the heated water may also be used for
consumption  the refrigerant is then allowed to expand  cool  and absorb heat to reheat to the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator  and the cycle repeats  this is a standard refrigeration cycle  save that the  cold  side of the refrigerator  the evaporator coil  is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder  in cold weather  the outdoor unit is intermittently defrosted by briefly switching to the cooling mode  this will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements  located in the air-handler  to be activated  at the same time  the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant  the condenser evaporator fan will not run during defrost mode 
in cooling mode the cycle is similar  but the outdoor coil is now the condenser and the indoor coil  which reaches a lower temperature  is the evaporator  this is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate 
operating principles  
mechanical heat pumps exploit the physical properties of a volatile evaporating and
fluid known as a   the heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed  and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed 
a simple stylized diagram of a heat pump s
cycle  1 condenser  2 expansion valve  3 evaporator  4 compressor 
a fictitious pressure-volume diagram for a typical refrigeration cycle
the working fluid  in its gaseous state  is pressurized and circulated through the system by a   on the discharge side of the compressor  the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a   called a   until it condenses into a high pressure  moderate temperature liquid  the condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device  this may be an  
tube  or possibly a work-extracting device such as a   the low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger  the evaporator  in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils  the refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated   
it is essential that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature  when compressed  to release heat through the  hot  heat exchanger  the condenser   similarly  the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand  or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger  the evaporator   in particular  the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side  the greater the temperature difference  the greater the required pressure difference  and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid  thus  as with all heat pumps  the
 amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required  decreases with increasing temperature difference 
is used to reduce the work and energy required to achieve a low enough temperature in the space to be cooled 
to operate in different temperature conditions  different refrigerants are available  refrigerators  air conditioners  and some heating systems are common applications that use this technology   
heat transport  
heat is typically transported through engineered heating or cooling systems by using a flowing gas or liquid  air is sometimes used  but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small amounts of heat  in systems using refrigerant  this working fluid can also be used to transport heat a considerable distance  though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage  when large amounts of heat are to be transported  water is typically used  often supplemented with     and other additives 
heat sources sinks  
a common source or sink for heat in smaller installations is the outside air  as used by an air-source heat pump  a fan is needed to improve heat exchange efficiency 
larger installations handling more heat  or in tight physical spaces  often use water-source heat pumps  the heat is sourced or rejected in water flow  which can carry much larger amounts of heat through a given pipe or duct cross-section than air flow can carry  the water may be heated at a remote location by     or other means  alternatively when needed  the water may be cooled by using a   or discharged into a large body of water  such as a lake  stream or an ocean 
or ground-source heat pumps use shallow underground heat exchangers as a heat source or sink  and water as the heat transport medium  this is possible because below ground level  the temperature is relatively constant across the seasons  and the earth can provide or absorb a large amount of heat  ground source heat pumps work in the same way as air-source heat pumps  but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground  ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside  although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost  the annual running costs are lower  because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently 
heat pump installations may be installed alongside an auxiliary conventional heat source such as electrical resistance heaters  or oil or gas combustion  the auxiliary source is installed to meet peak heating loads  or to provide a back-up system 
applications  
there are millions of domestic installations using common air source electric heat pumps  they are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs  hvac  and may also provide domestic hot water  the purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates 
hvac  
in
applications  a heat pump is typically a
device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow  thermal energy movement  may be reversed  the reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building  in cooler climates  the default setting of the reversing valve is heating  the default setting in warmer climates is cooling  because of the two heat exchangers  the condenser and evaporator  must swap functions  they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes  therefore  the seer rating  which is the seasonal energy
rating  of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines  for equipment to receive the energy star rating  it must have a rating of at least 14.5 seer

applications  a heat pump is sometimes used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools or   the heat energy removed from an air-conditioned space may be recovered for heating water

noise  
both indoor and outdoor heat pump units contain moving mechanical components which produce noise  in 2013  the
started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units  although the cen tc 113 business plan outset was that  consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations   no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by january 2016 
noise from outdoor units sometimes exceeds noise levels permitted by the legislation  for example  the 2015 data sheet of the  mr slim  zubadan inverter heat pump informs whoever reads it  including the pump s owner s neighbors  that the mr slim outdoor unit generates 52db a  in heating mode  this is more than is permitted by legislation in some countries  for example the uk  where this or similar pumps are used  another example is poland  where the noise level permitted in residential areas is 40db at night  which is more than the uk limit  35db   but still puts the mr slim outdoor unit 12db above the limit  in the united states  the allowed nighttime noise level was defined in 1974 as  an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55
to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas  u s  epa 1974   this limit is a daynight 24-hr average noise level  ldn   with a 10-dba penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels  the 10-db a  penalty makes the permitted u s  nighttime noise level equal to 45 db a   which is more than is accepted in some european countries but less than the noise produced by some heat pumps 
therefore  it is important to pay special attention to those heat pumps which are advertised as being extremely efficient and generating noise at a very low level  supposedly  at the same time  the simultaneity of the two conditions being met together can be tested in the example of the toshiba residential super daiseikai g2kvp inverter hiwall heat pump  the product is advertised as having  extremely high efficiencies with 5.15 and a noise level of only 20 db in ultra-low fan speed for the ras-10g2kvp   it is possible to download a brochure by clicking on a pdf download button at the bottom of the site  the technical specifications are given on the last page of the brochure and one can verify the correctness of the initial commercial information  the detail missing at the beginning is that the value of 20db a  for ras-10g2kvp only refers to the indoor unit in the quiet mode  42db a  in the high mode  whereas the external unit produces 61db a  in the heating mode which is not reported in the commercial introduction  the level of 61db  a  exceeds the environmental noise limits worldwide 
the location of an outdoor unit in relation to the building wall is significant  the unit  1  shown on page 7 of the heat pump product brochure published by american standard heating conditioning is placed close to the center of the house wall  like
playing a   shells and walls made of hard material are used behind a sound source if passive sound amplification is desired  such a location of the outdoor unit adds extra db a  of
from the wall  the db level is not reported in the brochure and the location of the neighbors  house is not shown in the picture  but this type of location should not be used close to a place planned as a quiet place even if the unit is quiet  the heat pump outdoor unit is not a musician performing to an audience 
another feature of
external heat exchangers is their need to stop the fan from time to time for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode  after that  the heat pump starts to work again  this part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan  the acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dba  this is included in legislation in france  according to the french concept of noise nuisance   noise emergence  is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise  and ambient noise without the disturbing noise  the emergence should be below 3db a  at night  between 10.00 pm and 7.00 am   so the pump in france  once stopped at night  theoretically should not be allowed to switch on again until morning  in addition  the level of ambient noise including the disturbing noise must be below 30db a  in france  a condition which definitely cannot be met without an effective sound barrier by most ashps which were commercially available by the end of 2015 
however  ashp outdoor units are still being installed in residential areas worldwide without any noise protection  as no recognized standards for heat pump outdoor noise barriers are available yet  as of january 2016 
performance considerations  
when comparing the performance of heat pumps  it is best to avoid the word  efficiency   which has a very specific thermodynamic definition  the term
 cop  is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input  most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input 
according to the us   geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44  compared with air-source heat pumps and up to 72  compared with electric resistance heating  heatpumps in general have a cop of 4.2 to 4.6 which places it behind
with a cop of 9 
when used for heating a building with an outside temperature of  for example  10c  a typical
 ashp  has a cop of 3 to 4  whereas an electrical resistance
has a cop of 1.0  that is  one
of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat  while under ideal conditions  one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place  note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones  so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher cop  as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge   when there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs  the cop is lower  worse   in extreme cold weather the cop will go down to 1.0 
on the other hand 
 gshp  benefit from the moderate temperature underground  as the ground acts naturally as a store of thermal energy  their year-round cop is therefore normally in the range of 2.5 to 5.0 
when there is a high temperature differential  e g   when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of  say  0c  32f    it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day  ultimately  due to
limits  the heat pump s performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases  outside temperature gets colder   reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at 273c  in practice  a cop of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around 18c  0f  for air source heat pumps 
also  as the heat pump takes heat out of the air  some moisture in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger  the system must periodically melt this ice  this defrosting translates into an additional energy  electricity  expenditure 
when it is extremely cold outside  it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source  such as an electric resistance heater  oil furnace  or gas furnace  rather than to run an air-source heat pump  also  avoiding the use of the heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine s compressor 
the design of the evaporator and condenser heat exchangers is also very important to the overall efficiency of the heat pump  the heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential  between the refrigerant and the air stream  directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to do in order to provide the same heating or cooling effect  generally  the larger the heat exchanger  the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes 
heat exchangers are expensive  requiring drilling for some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient  and the heat pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency  heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage when it comes to initial investment  not long-term savings  compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers  so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards  electricity rates will also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps 
in cooling mode  a heat pump s operating performance is described in the us as its
 eer  or
 seer   and both measures have units of btu  hw   1 btu  hw   0.293 w w   a larger eer number indicates better performance  the manufacturer s literature should provide both a cop to describe performance in heating mode  and an eer or seer to describe performance in cooling mode  actual performance varies  however  and depends on many factors such as installation details  temperature differences  site elevation  and maintenance 
as with any piece of equipment that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid  it is important for both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean  if deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils  the efficiency of the unit  both in heating and cooling modes  will suffer 
heat pumps are more effective for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal  this is because the compressor s input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode  and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space  but for cooling  the condenser is normally outdoors  and the compressor s dissipated work  waste heat  must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy  rather than being put to a useful purpose  for the same reason  opening a food refrigerator or freezer has the net effect of heating up the room rather than cooling it  because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air  this heat includes the compressor s dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance

one observation is that while current  best practice  heat pumps  ground source system  operating between 0c and 35c  have a typical cop around 4  no better than 5  the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental
limits  this means that in the coming decades  the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double  cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better   fitting hvac machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows  and solving internal
problems resulting from slower gas flow  depending on the working fluid  the expansion stage can be important also  work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power   an evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole  but an ideal gas is not  
types  
compression vs  absorption  
the two main types of heat pumps are
and absorption  compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy  typically driven by electricity   while absorption heat pumps may also run on heat as an energy source  from electricity or burnable fuels   an absorption heat pump may be fueled by
or   for example  while the gas utilization efficiency in such a device  which is the ratio of the energy supplied to the energy consumed  may average only 1.5  that is better than a natural gas or lp gas furnace  which can only approach 1 
heat sources and sinks  
by definition  all heat sources for a heat pump must be colder in temperature than the space to be heated  most commonly  heat pumps draw heat from the air  outside or inside air  or from the ground   or   
the heat drawn from ground-sourced systems is in most cases stored solar heat  and it should not be confused with direct   though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground  true geothermal heat  when used for heating  requires a circulation pump but no heat pump  since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated  so the technology relies only upon simple  
other heat sources for heat pumps include water  nearby streams and other natural water bodies have been used  and sometimes domestic waste water  via   which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures  though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated  
a number of sources have been used for the heat source for heating private and communal buildings 
air  ashp

air source heat pump  extracts heat from outside air 
airair heat pump  transfers heat to inside air 
airwater heat pump  transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water 
air-air heat pumps  that extract heat from outside air and transfer this heat to inside air  are the most common type of heat pumps and the cheapest  these are similar to
operating in reverse  air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps  but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit 
being the most efficient  and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building  however  ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps  and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems 
air source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and have therefore historically been the most widely used heat pump type  however  they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source  the higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency  in mild weather 
may be around 4.0  while at temperatures below around 0c  32f  an air-source heat pump may still achieve a cop of 2.5  the average cop over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8  with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates 
in areas where only fossil fuels are available  e g  heating oil only  no natural gas pipes available  air source heat pumps could be used as an alternative  supplemental heat source to reduce a building s dependence on fossil fuel  depending on fuel and electricity prices  using the heat pump for heating may be less expensive than using fossil fuel  a backup fossil-fuel  solar hot water or biomass heat source may still be required for the coldest days   
the heating output of low temperature optimized heat pumps  and hence their energy efficiency  still declines dramatically as the temperature drops  but the threshold at which the decline starts is lower than conventional pumps  as shown in the following table  temperatures are approximate and may vary by manufacturer and model

ground-source heat pumps  also called geothermal heat pumps  typically have higher efficiencies than air-source heat pumps  this is because they draw heat from the ground or
which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet  9 m   this means that the temperature differential is lower  leading to higher efficiency  well maintained ground-source heat pumps typically have cops of 4.0 at the beginning of the heating season  with lower seasonal cops of around 3.0 as heat is drawn from the ground  the tradeoff for this improved performance is that a ground-source heat pump is more expensive to install  due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid  water with a little antifreeze  
when compared  groundwater heat pumps are generally more efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil  closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized  this can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity  and the overall system has been designed to be just big enough to handle a  typical worst case  cold spell  or is simply undersized for the load  one way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop  is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days  thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop  there are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop  one way is to make large solar collectors  for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof  or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof  or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot  a further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized  by ensuring
and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design

hybrid  or twin source  heat pumps  when outdoor air is above 4 to 8 celsius   40-50 fahrenheit  depending on ground water temperature  they use air  when air is colder  they use the ground source  these twin source systems can also store summer heat  by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger  even when the heat pump itself is not running  this has dual advantage  it functions as a low running cost for air cooling  and  if ground water is relatively stagnant  it cranks up the temperature of the ground source  which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4  for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source

the air water-brine water heat pump is a hybrid heat pump  developed in rostock  germany  that uses only renewable energy sources  unlike other hybrid systems  which usually combine both conventional and renewable energy sources  it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device  the air water-brine water heat pump has two evaporators  an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator  both connected to the heat pump cycle  this allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions  for example  air temperature   the unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode  air or geothermal heat  or both together  the process is controlled by a control unit  which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system 
the control unit comprises two controllers  one for the air heat cycle and one for the geothermal circulation  in one device  all components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system  the german patent and trade mark office in munich granted the air water-brine water heat pump a patent in 2008  under the title heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump  this hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage  it trades and is marketed under the name thermselect  in the united kingdom  thermselect won the 2013 commercial heating product of the year award of the hvr awards for excellence  organised by heating and ventilating review  an industry magazine

is a machine that represents the integration of a heat pump and
in a single integrated system  typically these two technologies are used separately  or only placing them in parallel  to produce   in this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump s evaporator  the goal of this system is to get high
and then produce energy in a more
and less expensive way

heat pumps are only highly efficient when they generate heat at a low temperature differential  ideally around or below 32c  90f   normal steel plate radiators are not practical  because they would need to be four to six times their current size  underfloor heating is one ideal solution  when wooden floors or carpets would spoil efficiency  wall heaters  plastic pipes covered with a thick layer of chalk  and piped ceilings can be used  these systems have the disadvantage that they are slow starters  and that they would require extensive renovation in existing buildings 
the alternative is a warm air system  such a setup can either complement slower floor heating during warm up  or it can be a quick and economical way to implement a heat pump system into existing buildings  oversizing the fans and ductwork can reduce the
they produce  to efficiently distribute warm water or air from a heat pump  water pipes or air shafts must have significantly larger diameters than in conventional  hotter-source systems  and underfloor heaters should have much more pipes per square meter   
solid state heat pumps  
magnetic  
main article 
in 1881  the german physicist
put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found that it increased very slightly in temperature  some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway  claiming to cut energy consumption by 40  compared to current domestic refrigerators  the process works as follows  powdered
is moved into a magnetic field  heating the material by 2 to 5c  4 to 9f   the heat is removed by a circulating fluid  the material is then moved out of the magnetic field  reducing its temperature below its starting temperature

    compared with 4060  achieved by conventional compression cycle systems  reverse
systems using compression expansion   however  this area of technology is currently the subject of active research in materials science  a reason why this is popular is because it has a  long lifetime  as there are no moving parts and it does not use potentially hazardous refrigerants
