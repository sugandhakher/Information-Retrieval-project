the london array is a 175 turbine 630mw
located 20km off the
coast in the outer
in the   it is the largest offshore wind farm in the world  and the largest wind farm in europe by megawatt capacity 
construction of phase 1 of the wind farm began in march 2011 and was completed by mid 2013  being formally inaugurated by the  
on 4 july 2013 
the second phase of the project was refused planning consent in 2014 due to concerns on the impact to sea birds

description  
the wind farm site is more than 20 kilometres  12mi  off the
on the
coast in the area between long sand and   between
in kent and
in essex  the site is mostly away from shipping lanes 
the first phase consisted of 175
swt-3.6 turbines and two offshore substations  giving a wind farm with a peak rated power of 630mw  each turbine and offshore substation is erected on a   and connected together by 210 kilometres  130mi  of 33kv array cables  the two offshore substations are connected to an onshore substation at cleve hill  near   on the north kent coast  by four 150kv subsea export cables  in total 220 kilometres  140mi   it is named after london because the power goes to the london grid 
the smaller
is to the south of it 
the array is intended to reduce annual
emissions by about 900,000 tons  equal to the emissions of 300,000 passenger cars 
history  
in 2001 environmental studies identified areas of the outer
as potential sites for offshore wind farm  the
published the paper future offshore -a strategic framework for the offshore wind industry  which identified the outer thames estuary as one of three potential areas for future wind farm development     the
awarded a 50-year lease to london array ltd   a consortium of e on uk renewables  shell windenergy  and core limited   in december 2003  a planning application was submitted in 2005  which was approved in december 2006  planning permission for the onshore electricity substation was received in november 2007 
in may 2008  shell announced that it was pulling out of the project  it was announced in july 2008 that e on uk and dong energy would buy shell s stake  subsequently on 16 october 2008  london array announced the
based masdar would join e on as a joint venture party in the scheme  under the agreement  masdar purchased 40  of e on s half share of the scheme  giving masdar a 20  stake in the project overall  the resultant ownership was 50    30 
and 20   
in march 2009  the backers agreed on an initial investment of 2.2billion  financing of phase 1 was achieved through the
and the danish export credit fund with 250 million 
in 2013  in response to  offshore transmission owner  regulations  see    the consortium divested the electrical transmission assets of the wind farm  valued at 459 million  to  blue transmission london array limited   an entity incorporated by barclays infrastructure funds management limited    and diamond uk transmission corporation   subsidiary

with london array top right  and neighbouring wind farm areas 
in january 2014 dong sold half its stake to quebec public pension plan manager
  la caisse   
at the time of its construction it was the largest offshore wind farm in the world 
construction and commissioning  
offshore work began in march 2011  the first foundation was installed in march 2011
turbines were supplied by   their foundations were built by the joint-venture between per aarsleff and   the same company supplied and installed the monopiles  generators were installed by mpi and
by using an installation vessel
and a
barge sea worker  two offshore substations were designed  fabricated and installed by future energy  a joint venture between fabricom  iemants and geosea  while electrical systems and onshore substation work was undertaken by siemens transmission   distribution  the subsea export cable was supplied by
and array cables by jdr cable systems  the array cables and the export cables were installed by vsmc 
the wind farm started producing electricity at the end of october 2012  all 175 turbines of phase 1 were confirmed fully operational on 8 april 2013  and the wind farm was formally inaugurated by the prime minister
on 4 july 2013  in december 2015 it produced 369 gwh  a monthly
of 78.9   it produced 2.5 twh in 2015  during two days of january 2016  production varied from 3 mw to 619 mw 
phase 2  
a second phase was planned which would have seen a further 166 turbines installed to increase the capacity to 1000mw  however  the second phase was scaled back and finally cancelled in february 2014 after concerns were raised by the
about its effect on a local population of
