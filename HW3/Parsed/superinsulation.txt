the
standard combines superinsulation with other techniques and technologies to achieve ultra-low energy use 
superinsulation is an approach to building design  construction  and retrofitting that dramatically reduces heat loss  and gain  by using much higher levels of insulation and airtightness than normal  superinsulation is one of the ancestors of the
approach

definition  
there is no set definition of superinsulation  but superinsulated buildings typically include 
very high levels of
 typically
walls and
roof  corresponding to
of 0.15 and 0.1 w  mk  respectively 
details to ensure insulation continuity where walls meet roofs  foundations  and other walls
airtight construction  especially around doors and windows to prevent air infiltration pushing heat in or out
a
system to provide fresh air
no large windows facing any particular direction
much smaller than conventional heating system  sometimes just a small backup heater
nisson   dutt  1985  suggest that a house might be described as  superinsulated  if the cost of space heating is lower than the cost of water heating 
theory  
a superinsulated house is intended to reduce heating needs very significantly and may even be heated predominantly by intrinsic heat sources  waste heat generated by appliances and the
of the occupants  with very small amounts of backup heat  this has been demonstrated to work even in very cold climates but requires close attention to construction details in addition to the insulation  see   
history  
the term  superinsulation  was coined by wayne schick at the   in 1976 he was part of a team that developed a design called the  lo-cal  house  using computer simulations based on the climate of   several houses  duplexes and condos based on lo-cal principles were built in  
in the 1970s 
in 1977 the  saskatchewan house  was built in
by a group of several canadian government agencies  it was the first house to publicly demonstrate the value of superinsulation and generated a lot of attention  it originally included some experimental evacuated-tube solar panels  but they were not needed and were later removed  the house was heated primarily by waste heat from appliances and the occupants 
in 1977 the  leger house  was built by eugene leger  in   it had a more conventional appearance than the  saskatchewan house   and also received extensive publicity 
publicity from the  saskatchewan house  and the  leger house  influenced other builders  and many superinsulated houses were built over the next few years  these houses also influenced
when he developed the  
retrofits  
it is possible  and increasingly desirable  to retrofit superinsulation to an existing houses or buildings  the easiest way is often to add layers of continuous rigid exterior insulation  and sometimes by building new exterior walls that allow more space for insulation  a
can be installed on the outside of the original framing but may not be needed  an improved continuous air barrier is almost always worth adding  as older homes tend to be leaky  and such an air barrier can be important for energy savings and durability  care should be exercised when adding a vapor barrier as it can reduce drying of incidental moisture  or even cause summer  in climates with humid summers 
and consequent
and   this may cause health problems for the occupants and damage the existing structure  many builders in northern canada use a simple 1/3 to 2/3 approach  placing the vapor barrier no further out than 1/3 of the r-value of the insulated portion of the wall  this method is generally valid for interior walls that have little or no vapor resistance  e g  they use fibrous insulation  and controls air leakage condensation as well as vapor diffusion condensation  this approach will ensure that condensation does not occur on or to the inside of the vapor barrier during cold weather  the 1/3 2/3 rule will ensure that the vapor barrier temperature will not fall below the dew point temperature of the interior air  and will minimize the possibility of cold-weather condensation problems  for example  with an internal room temperature of 20c  68f   the vapor barrier will then only reach 7.3 c  45 f  when the outside temperatures is at 18c  -1f   indoor air dewpoint temperatures are more likely to be in the order of around 0 c  32 f  when it is that cold outdoors  much lower than the predicted vapor barrier temperature  and hence the 1/3 2/3 rules is quite conservative  for climates that do not often experience -18c  the 1/3 2/3 rule should be amended to 40 60  or 50 50  as the interior air dewpoint temperature is an important basis for such rules  buildings with high interior humidities during cold weather  e g   museums  swimming pools  humdified or poorly ventilated airtight homes  may require different rules  as can buildings with drier interior environments  such as highly ventilated buildings  warehouses   the 2009 international residential code  irc  embodies more sophisticated rules to guide the choice of insulation on the exterior of new homes  which can be applied when
older homes 
a vapor permeable building wrap on the outside of the original wall helps keep the wind out  yet allows the wall assembly to dry to the exterior 
and other products such as permeable polymer based products are available for this purpose  and usually double as the water resistant barrier   drainage plane as well 
interior retrofits are possible where the owner wants to preserve the old exterior siding  or where
requirements don t leave space for an exterior retrofit  sealing the air barrier is more difficult and the thermal insulation continuity compromised  because of the many partition  floor  and service penetrations   the original wall assembly is rendered colder in cold weather  and hence more prone to condensation and slower to dry   occupants are exposed to major disruptions  and the house is left with less interior space  another approach is to use the 1/3 to 2/3 method mentioned above  that is  to install a vapor retarder on the inside of the existing wall  if there isn t one there already  and add insulation and support structure to the inside  this way  utilities  power  telephone  cable  and plumbing  can be added in this new wall space without penetrating the air barrier  polyethylene vapor barriers are risky except in very cold climates  because they limit the wall s ability to dry to the interior  this approach also limits the amount of interior insulation that can be added to a rather small amount  e g   only r6 can be added to a 2x4 r12 wall  
costs and benefits  
in new construction  the cost of the extra insulation and wall framing may be offset by not requiring a dedicated central heating system  in homes with numerous rooms  more than one floor  air conditioning or large sized  a central furnace is often justified or required to ensure sufficiently uniform temperatures  small furnaces are not very expensive and some ductwork to every room is almost always required to provide ventilation air in any case  when peak demand and annual energy use is low  sophisticated and expensive central heating systems are not often required  hence  even electric resistance heaters may be used  electric heaters are typically only used on the coldest winter nights when overall demand for electricity is low  other forms of backup heater are widely used  such as wood pellets  wood stoves  natural gas boilers or even furnaces  the cost of a superinsulation retrofit should be balanced against the future cost of heating fuel  which can be expected to fluctuate from year to year due to supply problems  natural disasters or geopolitical events   the desire to reduce pollution from heating a building  or the desire to provide exceptional thermal comfort 
during a power failure  a superinsulated house stays warm longer as heat loss is much less than normal  but the thermal storage capacity of the structural materials and contents is the same  adverse weather may hamper efforts to restore power  leading to outages lasting a week or more  when deprived of their continuous supply of electricity  either for heat directly  or to operate gas-fired    conventional houses cool rapidly during  and may be at greater risk of costly damage due to freezing   residents who use supplemental heating methods without proper care during such episodes  or at any other time  may subject themselves to risk of
