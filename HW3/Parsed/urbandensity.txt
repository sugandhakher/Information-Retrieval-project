sustainability  
a graph showing the relationship between urban density and petrol use 
it is commonly asserted that higher density cities are more sustainable than low density cities  much urban   particularly in north america  the uk  australia and new zealand has been developed premised on raising urban densities  such as     and    
however  the link between urban density and aspects of
remains a contested area of planning theory      prominent urban designer and expert on   argues that low-density  dispersed cities are unsustainable as they are   a minority  such as randy o toole of the libertarian   counter that raising densities results in more expensive real estate  greater road congestion and more localized air pollution  others counter that traffic congestion is a result not of population density but of parking capacity  at a broader level  there is evidence to indicate a strong negative correlation between the total energy consumption of a city and its overall urban density  i e  the lower the density  the more energy consumed 
measurement  
urban density is a very specific measurement of the population of an urbanized area  excluding non-urban land-uses  non-urban uses include regional open space  agriculture and water-bodies 
there are a variety of other ways of measuring the density of urban areas 
- the total floor area of buildings divided by land area of the lot upon which the buildings are built
residential density - the number of dwelling units in any given area
- the number of human persons in any given area
employment density - the number of jobs in any given area
gross density - any density figure for a given area of land that includes uses not necessarily directly relevant to the figure  usually roads and other transport infrastructure 
net density - a density figure for a given area of land that excludes land not directly related to the figure 
weighted density - a density metric which measures the density at which the average citizen lives  it is determined by calculating the standard density of each census tract  assigning each a weight equal to its share of the total population  and then adding the segments
