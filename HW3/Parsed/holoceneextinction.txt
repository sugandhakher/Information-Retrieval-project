human influence on extinction  
extinction of animals  plants  and other organisms caused by human actions may go as far back as the late   over 12,000 years ago  there is evidence that abrupt climate change has especially played an enormous role in the extinction of larger mammals  however  while previous mass extinctions were due to natural environmental causes  research shows that wherever on earth humans have migrated  other species have gone extinct  and   most prominently in the past two centuries  is regarded as one of the underlying causes of extinction  in terms of how humans have contributed  three major factors include the
of   affecting the global climate  oceanic devastation  such as through
and contamination  and the modification and destruction of vast tracts of land and river systems around the world to meet solely human-centered ends  with 13 percent of earth s ice-free land surface now used as row-crop agricultural sites  26 percent used as pastures  and 4 percent urban-industrial areas   thus replacing the original local ecosystems  other  related human causes of the extinction event include       the introduction in various regions of   and the
of   at present  the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than the  base  or historically typical rate of extinction  in terms of the natural evolution of the planet  and also the current rate of extinction is  therefore  10 to 100 times higher than any of the previous
in the history of earth  it is also the only known mass extinction of plants   
the abundance of species extinctions considered   or due to human activity  have sometimes  especially when referring to hypothesized future events  been collectively called the  anthropocene extinction   the
is a term introduced in 2000  it is now posited by some that a new geological epoch has begun  characterised by the most abrupt and widespread extinction of species since the
66 million years ago  in the future of life  2002  
of harvard calculated that  if the current rate of human disruption of the biosphere continues  one-half of  s higher lifeforms will be extinct by 2100  a 1998 poll conducted by the
found that seventy percent of biologists believe that we are in the midst of an anthropogenic extinction  numerous scientific studiessuch as a 2004 report published in   and papers authored by the 10,000 scientists who contribute to the  s annual
of threatened specieshave since reinforced this conviction 
extinction of the megafauna in the late-pleistocene  
the evidence of all previous extinctions is geological in nature  and shorter geological time scale is of the order of several hundred thousand to several million years  even extinctions caused by instantaneous events such as the impact of the   which is currently the best example  extend the equivalent of many human lives  due to complex ecological interactions that were triggered by the event

in the   of these  only two have much scientific credibility  although ross mcphee proposed that a hyper-disease may have been the cause of the extinction  a study by lyons et al   demonstrated conclusively that a hyperdisease was unlikely to have caused the extinction  the two main theories to the extinction are
and   the climate change theory has suggested that a change in climate near the end of the late pleistocene stressed the megafauna to the point of extinction  some scientists favor abrupt climate change as the catalyst for the extinction of the mega-fauna at the end of the pleistocene  but there are many who believe increased hunting from early modern humans also played a part  with others even suggesting that the two interacted  in the americas  a controversial explanation for the shift in climate is presented under the

and the islands previously mentioned experiences population crashes and
shortly after the earliest human settlers  it has been suggested that the african megafauna survived as they evolved alongside humans  the timing of
extinction does not appear to correspond to human arrival  although the possibility of whether human activity at the time may have impacted the global climate enough to cause such an extinction has been suggested 
it has been noted  in the face of such evidence  homo sapiens is unique in its ecology as an unprecedented  global superpredator   regularly preying on large numbers of fully grown terrestrial and marine   and with a great deal of influence over food webs and climatic systems worldwide 
anthropogenic impact on climate during the holocene  
in order to constitute the
as an   scientists must determine exactly when anthropogenic
began to measurably alter natural atmospheric levels at a global scale and when these alterations caused changes to global climate  employing chemical proxies from antarctic ice cores  researchers have estimated the fluctuations of
 c02  and
 ch4  in the earths atmosphere for the
and holocene epochs  based on these studies  general argumentation of when the peak of the anthropocene occurred pertains to the timeframe within the previous two centuries  typically beginning with the   when greenhouse gas levels were recorded by contemporary methods at its highest  however  scientists that are employing a variance of
and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus  not originating as early as the   gaining popularity on his uncommon hypothesis  palaeoclimatologist
in 2003  stipulated that in the early holocene 11,000 years ago  atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels has fluctuated at a different pattern than the
epoch before it  he argued that the patterns of the significant decline of co2 levels during the last ice age of the pleistocene inversely correlates to the holocene where there has been dramatic increases of co2 around 8000 years ago and ch4 levels 3000 years after that  the correlation between the downfall of co2 in the
and the uprising of it during the
implies that the causation of this spark of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are due to the growth of
during the holocene such as the anthropogenic expansion of land and  
recent extinctions described are well-documented  but the
used varies  the term
is a term that is used by few scientists  and some commentators may refer to the current and projected future extinctions as part of a longer holocene extinction  the holoceneanthropocene boundary is contested  with some commentators asserting significant human influence on climate for much of what is normally regarded as the
  other commentators place the holoceneanthropocene boundary at the
while also saying that  formal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility  particularly to earth scientists working on late holocene successions  
agriculture  
human civilization flourished in accordance to the efficiency and intensification of prevailing   local communities that acquire more subsistence strategies increased in number to combat competitive pressures of land utilization  therefore  the holocene developed competition on the basis of agriculture  the growth of agriculture has then introduced newer means of climate change and pollution 
recent investigations about
landscape burning has a major implication for the current debate about the timing of the anthropocene and the role that humans may have played in the production of greenhouse gases prior to the   studies on early
raises questions about the current use of population size or density as a
for the amount of land clearance and anthropogenic burning that took place in preindustrial times  scientists have questioned the correlation between population size and early territorial alterations  ruddiman and ellis  research paper in 2009 makes the case that early farmers involved in systems of agriculture used more land per capita than growers more later in the holocene  who intensified their labor to produce more food per unit of area  arguing that agricultural involvement in rice production implemented thousands of years ago by relatively small populations have created significant environmental impacts through large-scale means of deforestation 
while a number of human-derived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of ch4 and co2  deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally 
climate  
climate change in the early
was distinguished prior to the
15,000 years ago which then started the current period of the glacial retreat where climate started to increase significantly 11,000 years ago  the
contained a vast number of temperature fluctuations that can be dated from the warm period of the
in 5000 to 3000 bc that consisted of temperatures that were 1-2 degrees celsius warmer than today to the more recent emergence of the   during this period  came the development of ancient civilizations of the earliest
and the growth of agriculture due to the increase of tropical regions  deepening the understanding of the
impact in the early holocene is a vital factor for analyzing interglacial climate instability due to their involvement in producing of  
methodologies of the holocene climatic optimum  
to undermine the present and future human-induced climatic changes 
and
have correlated the increases of temperatures with the variations of
exposed to certain latitudinal earth bands during the early holocene  thus  believing that the holocene warming was solar in origin where only certain parts of the world experienced warmer climates during seasons such as summer  moreover  scientists have conducted numerous oceanic sediments that can be dated back to the   and discovered drastic increases of sea-levels and their sea-level highstands  this evidence of drastic increases of sea levels indicates that the deterioration of ice cores is crucial to understanding how the
began and how it played as one of the major transgressions during the   as speculations of how the holocene climatic optimum began remain scientifically unclear  impurities in gaseous chemistry inside these ice cores have been conducted as a valuable method of obtaining evidence of abnormal temperature fluctuations  the
showed to have a greater volume and much larger in the holocene than what it is today and the
to have been more fertile  this in turn  led many anthropogenic hypotheses to claim that more tropical territories encouraged agricultural processes  however  there is greater complexity as to whether such changes are heavily caused by anthropogenic effects on climate because of limited methods that can directly identify an empirical correlation
