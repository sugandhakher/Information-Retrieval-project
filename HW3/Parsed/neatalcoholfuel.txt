summary of the main ethanol blends used around the world
several common ethanol fuel mixtures are in use around the world  the use of pure hydrous or anhydrous ethanol in
 ices  is only possible if the engines are designed or modified for that purpose  and used only in  
and   anhydrous ethanol can be blended with
 petrol  for use in gasoline engines  but with high ethanol content only after minor engine modifications 
ethanol fuel mixtures have  e  numbers which describe the percentage of
in the mixture by volume  for example  e85 is 85 
ethanol and 15  gasoline  low-ethanol blends  from e5 to e25  are also known as gasohol  though internationally the most common use of the term refers to the e10 blend 
blends of e10 or less are used in more than 20 countries around the world  led by the united states  where ethanol represented 10  of the u s  gasoline fuel supply in 2011  blends from e20 to e25 have been used in brazil since the late 1970s  e85 is commonly used in the u s  and europe for  
ethanol or e100 is used in brazilian
and flex-fuel light vehicles and hydrous e15 called he15 for modern petrol cars in the netherlands

e10 or less  
e10  a
mixture of 10 
ethanol and 90  gasoline sometimes called gasohol  can be used in the
of most modern
and
without need for any modification on the engine or fuel system  e10 blends are typically rated as being 2 to 3 octane numbers higher than regular gasoline and are approved for use in all new u s  automobiles  and mandated in some areas for emissions and other reasons  the e10 blend and lower ethanol content mixtures have been used in several countries  and its use has been primarily driven by the several world energy shortages that have taken place since the  
typical warning placed in the fuel filler of u s  vehicles regarding the capability of using up to e10 and warning against the use of blends between e20 and e85 
other common blends include e5 and e7  these concentrations are generally safe for recent engines that should run on pure gasoline  as of 2006  mandates for blending
into vehicle fuels had been enacted in at least 36 states provinces and 17 countries at the national level  with most mandates requiring a blend of 10 to 15  ethanol with gasoline 
one measure of alternative fuels in the u s  is the     geg   in 2002  the u s  used as motor fuel  ethanol equal to 137,000
 tj   the energy equivalent of 1.13 billion u s  gallons  4.3 billion liters  of gasoline  this was less than 1  of the total fuel used that year 
e10 and other blends of ethanol are considered to be useful in decreasing u s  dependence on foreign oil  and can reduce
 co  emissions by 20 to 30  under the right conditions  although e10 does decrease emissions of co and greenhouse gases such as
by an estimated 2  over regular gasoline  it can cause increases in evaporative emissions and some pollutants depending on factors such as the age of the vehicle and weather conditions  according to the philippine department of energy  the use of not more than a 10  ethanol-gasoline mixture is not harmful to cars  fuel systems  generally  automobile gasoline containing alcohol  ethanol or methanol  is not allowed to be used in u s  certificated aircraft

e10 was introduced nationwide in
in 2007  and replaced 91 octane pure gasoline in that country in 2013 
e10 logo required on
fuel dispensers
e10 is commonly available in the   it was also mandated for use in all standard automobile fuel in the state of
by the end of 2010  due to the phasing out of
as a gasoline additive and mainly due to the mandates established in the
and the   ethanol blends have increased throughout the united states  and by 2009  the ethanol market share in the u s  gasoline supply reached almost 8  by volume 
the
chain of supermarkets in the uk have started selling an e5 brand of gasoline marketed as 99 ron super-unleaded    its selling price is lower than the other two forms of high-octane unleaded on the market  shell s
 99 ron  and bp s ultimate  97 ron  
many petrol stations throughout australia now also sell e10  typically at a few cents cheaper per litre than regular unleaded  it is more commonly found throughout the state of queensland due to its large sugarcane farming regions  the use of e10 is also subsidised by the queensland government    many petrol stations no longer offer a  regular 91  petrol option  instead only offering regular e10  91   premium  95  and premium  98   although regular unleaded remains commonly available in victoria 
in sweden  all 95-octane gasoline is e5  while the status of 98-octane fuel is currently unclear    the product data sheets of the major fuel chains do not clearly state ethanol content of their 98-octane gasoline  in the early-mid-1990s  some fuel chains sold e10 
from january 2011  all 95-octane fuel in finland is e10  and 98e5 octane fuel is also available 
mandatory blending of ethanol was approved in   but the percentage in the blend has not been specified 
approved a biofuel strategy in 2007  and mandated an 8  blend of ethanol by 2013 
a 2007
law mandates a minimum of 5  of ethanol blended with gasoline starting in january 2015  the monopolic  state-owned fuel producer
started blending premium gasoline with 10  of bioethanol in december 2009  which will be available in all the country by early january 2010  the other two gasolines will follow later in 2010

a 2011 study conducted by
found practically no difference in fuel consumption in normal driving conditions between commercial gasoline grades 95e10 and 98e5 sold in finland  despite the public perception that fuel consumption is significantly higher with 95e10  vtt performed the comparison test under controlled laboratory conditions and their measurements showed the cars tested used an average of 10.30 liters  2.27impgal  2.72u s gal  of 95e10 per 100km  62mi   as opposed to 10.23 liters  2.25impgal  2.70u s gal  of 98e5 per 100km  62mi   the difference was 0.07 in favor of 98e5 on average  meaning that using 95e10 gasoline  which has a higher ethanol content  increases consumption by 0.7   when the measurements are normalized  the difference becomes 1.0   a result that is highly consistent with an estimation of
based on approximate fuel composition  which came out at 1.1  in favour of e5 
e15  
typical manufacturer s statement in the car owner s manual regarding the vehicle s capability of using up to  
e15 contains 15  ethanol and 85  gasoline  this is generally the highest ratio of ethanol to gasoline that is possible to use in vehicles recommended by some auto manufacturers to run on e10 in the us  this is due to ethanol s hydrophilia and solvent power 
as a result of the   which mandates an increase in renewable fuels for the transport sector  the
began assessments for the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet as a way to allow higher consumption of ethanol fuel  the
 nrel  conducted tests to evaluate the potential impacts of intermediate ethanol blends on legacy vehicles and other engines  in a preliminary report released in october 2008  the nrel presented the results of the first evaluations of the effects of e10  e15 and e20 gasoline blends on tailpipe and evaporative emissions  catalyst and engine durability  vehicle driveability  engine operability  and vehicle and engine materials  this preliminary report found none of the vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light as a result of the ethanol blend used  no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed  no cold start problems were observed at 24  75  and 10  50  laboratory conditions  and as expected  computer technology available in newer model vehicles adapts to the higher octane causing lower emissions with greater horsepower and in some cases greater fuel economy 
in march 2009  a lobbying group from the ethanol industry  growth energy  formally requested the
 epa  to allow the ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15  from 10   organizations doing such studies included the energy department  the state of minnesota  the   the   the minnesota center for automotive research  and
in sweden 
epa s e15 label required to be displayed in all e15 fuel dispensers in the u s 
in october 2010  the epa granted a waiver to allow up to 15  of ethanol blended with gasoline to be sold only for cars and light pickup trucks with a model year of 2007 or later  representing about 15  of vehicles on u s  roads  in january 2011  the waiver was expanded to authorize use of e15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles  the epa also decided not to grant any waiver for e15 use in any motorcycles  heavy-duty vehicles  or nonroad engines because current testing data do not support such a waiver  according to the renewable fuels association  the e15 waivers now cover 62  of vehicles on the road in the us  and the ethanol group estimates if all 2001 and newer cars and pickups were to use e15  the theoretical blend wall for ethanol use would be approximately 17.5 billion gallons  66.2 billion liters  per year  the epa was still studying if older cars can withstand a 15  ethanol blend 
the epa waiver authorizes sale of e15 only from sep 15 to may 31 out of a black hose and a yellow hose to flex fuel vehicles only from june 1 to sep 14  retailers have shunned building infrastructure due to the costly regulatory requirements which have created a practical barrier to the commercialization of the higher blend  most fuel stations do not have enough pumps to offer the new blend  few existing pumps are certified to dispense e15  and no dedicated tanks are readily available to store e15  also  some state and federal regulations would have to change before e15 can be legally sold  the national association of convenience stores  which represents most gasoline retailers  considers the potential for actual e15 demand is small   because the auto industry is not embracing the fuel and is not adjusting their warranties or recommendations for the fuel type   one possible solution to the infrastructure barriers is the introduction of blender pumps that allow consumers to turn a dial to select the level of ethanol  which would also allow owners of
to buy e85 fuel 
in june 2011 epa  in cooperation with the   issued its final ruling regarding the e15 warning label required to be displayed in all e15 fuel dispensers in the u s  to inform consumers about what vehicles can  and what vehicles and equipment cannot  use the e15 blend  both the
and the
complained that relying solely on this warning label is not enough to protect consumers from misfueling  in july 2012  a fueling station in
became the first in the u s  to sell the e15 blend  the fuel is sold through a blender pump that allows customers to choose between e10  e15  e30 or e85  with the latter blends sold only to   as of june 2013  there are about 24 fueling stations selling e15 out of 180,000 stations across the u s 
blender fuel pump in
selling e15 together with the standard gasoline  e10   and the higher blends e30 and e85 
in december 2010  several groups  including the alliance of automobile manufacturers  the american petroleum institute  the   the national marine manufacturers association  the outdoor power equipment institute  and the   filed suit against the epa in the   the plaintiffs argued the epa does not have the authority to issue a partial waiver that covers some cars and not others  among other arguments  the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars  but also for fuel pumps and underground tanks not designed for the e15 mixture  it was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the big jump in corn prices in recent years  in august 2012  the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the epa  the case was thrown out on a technical reason  as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge epa s decision to issue the waiver for e15  in june 2013 the
declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the epa ruling about e15  and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand 
2012
fuel filler cap showing warning regarding the maximum ethanol blend allowed by the carmaker  up to e10 gasoline  the warning label indicates that ethanol blends between e15 to e85 shall not be used in this vehicle 
as of november 2012  sales of e15 are not authorized in california  and according to the
 carb   the blend is still awaiting approval  and in a public statement the agency said that  it would take several years to complete the vehicle testing and rule development necessary to introduce a new transportation fuel into california s market  
according to a survey conducted by the
 aaa  in 2012  only about 12 million out of the more than 240 million light-duty vehicles on the u s  roads in 2012 are approved by manufacturers are fully compliant with e15 gasoline  according with the association          and
warned that their warranties will not cover e15-related damage  despite the controversy  in order to adjust to epa regulations  2012 and 2013
vehicles manufactured by
can use fuel containing up to 15 percent ethanol  as indicated in the vehicle owners  manuals  however  the carmaker warned that for model year 2011 or earlier vehicles  they  strongly recommend that gm customers refer to their owners manuals for the proper fuel designation for their vehicles  
also is manufacturing all of its 2013 vehicles e15 compatible  including
and vehicles with   also
built since 2001 are approved by its manufacturer to use e15  volkswagen announced that for the 2014 model year  its entire lineup will be e15 capable 
announced in august 2015 that all 2016 model year     
and
vehicles will be e15 compatible 
in november 2013  the environmental protection agency opened for public comment its proposal to reduce the amount of ethanol required in the u s  gasoline supply as mandated by the   the agency cited problems with increasing the blend of ethanol above 10   this limit  known as the  blend wall   refers to the practical difficulty in incorporating increasing amounts of ethanol into the transportation fuel supply at volumes exceeding those achieved by the sale of nearly all gasoline as e10 
he15  
example of public gas station with he15 next to diesel and regular gasoline 
a 15  hydrous ethanol and 85  gasoline blend  he15  has been introduced at public gas stations in the netherlands since 2008  ethanol fuel specifications worldwide traditionally dictate use of anhydrous ethanol  less than 1  water  for gasoline blending  this results in additional costs  energy usage and environmental impacts associated with the extra processing step required to dehydrate the hydrous ethanol produced via distillation  3.5-4.9 vol   water  to meet the current anhydrous ethanol specifications  a patented discovery reveals hydrous ethanol can be effectively used in most ethanol gasoline blending applications 
according to the brazilian anp specification  hydrous ethanol contains up to 4.9 vol   water  in he15  this would be up to 0.74 vol   water in the overall mixture  japanese and german scientific evidence revealed the water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol 
the experiments show that water in fuel ethanol inhibits dry corrosion  at 10,000 ppm water in the e50 experiments by jari and 3,500 ppm water in the e20 experiments by tu darmstadt the alcoholate alkoxide corrosion stopped  in the fuel ethanol this resembles 20,000 ppm or 2 volume  in the case of jari and 5 x 3500   17,500 ppm of 1.75 volume  in the case of tu darmstadt  the observations are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol  the reaction mechanism will be the same at lower-mid blends  when enough water is present in the fuel  the aluminum will react preferably with water to produce aluminum oxide  repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer  which is why the corrosion stops  the aluminum alcoholate alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer  which is why the corrosion continues  in other words  water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer  based on the japanese german results  a minimum of 2 vol   or 2.52  m m water is currently proposed in the revision of the hydrous ethanol specification for blending in petrol at e10  levels  water injection has additional positive effects on the engine performance  thermodynamic efficiency  and reduces overall co2 emissions

overall  a transition from anhydrous to hydrous ethanol for gasoline blending is expected to make a significant contribution to ethanol s cost-competitiveness  fuel cycle net energy balance  air quality  and greenhouse gas emissions 
the level of blending above 10   v v  is chosen both from a technical  safety  perspective and to distinguish the product in europe from regular unleaded petrol for reasons of taxes and customer clarity  small-scale tests have shown many vehicles with modern engine types can run smoothly on this hydrous ethanol blend  mixed tanking scenarios with anhydrous ethanol blends at 5  or 10  level do not induce phase separation  as avoiding mixing with e0  in particular at extremely low temperatures  in logistic systems and engines is not recommended  a separate specification for controlled usage is presented in a netherlands technical agreement nta 8115  the nta 8115 is written for a worldwide application in trading and fuel blending

note  the 2010 reduction from e25 to e20 was temporary and took
place between february and april  the lower limit was reduced
from 20  to 18  in april 2011 
e20 contains 20  ethanol and 80  gasoline  while e25 contains 25  ethanol  these blends have been widely used in brazil since the late 1970s  as a response to the   the brazilian government made mandatory the blend of
with gasoline  fluctuating between 10  to 22  from 1976 until 1992  due to this mandatory minimum gasoline blend  pure gasoline  e0  is no longer sold in brazil  a federal law was passed in october 1993 establishing a mandatory blend of 22 
ethanol  e22  in the entire country  this law also authorized the executive to set different percentages of ethanol within pre-established boundaries  and since 2003  these limits were fixed at a maximum of 25   e25  and a minimum of 20   e20  by volume  since then  the government has set the percentage on the ethanol blend according to the results of the
harvest and ethanol production from sugarcane  resulting in blend variations even within the same year 
since july 1  2007  the mandatory blend was set at 25  of
ethanol  e25  by executive decree  and this has been the standard gasoline blend sold throughout brazil most of the time as of 2011  however  as a result of a supply shortage and the resulting high ethanol fuel prices  in 2010  the government mandated a temporary 90-day blend reduction from e25 to e20 beginning february 1  2010  as prices rose abruptly again due to supply shortages that took place again between the 2010 and 2011 harvest seasons  some ethanol had to be imported from the united states  and in april 2011  the government reduced the minimum mandatory blend to 18   leaving the mandatory blend range between e18 and e25 
a blender pump is a multifuel blend dispenser that allows customers to choose between e20  e30  e85  or any other preselected blend 
all brazilian automakers have adapted their gasoline engines to run smoothly with this range of mixtures  thus  all gasoline vehicles are built to run with blends from e20 to e25  defined by local law as  common gasoline type c   some vehicles might work properly with lower concentrations of ethanol  but with a few exceptions  they are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline  which causes   as vehicles traveling to neighboring south american countries have demonstrated    which can run on any type of
e20-e25 up to 100 
 e100 or hydrated ethanol  ratios  were first available in mid-2003  in july 2008  86  of all new light vehicles sold in brazil were flexible-fuel  and only two carmakers build models with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate with pure gasoline  e0  
with the models      
and   and
with the  
introduced e20 in 2008  but shortages in ethanol supplies by mid-2008 caused a delay in the expansion of the e20 fueling station network in the country  by mid-2010  161 fueling stations were selling e20  and sales have risen 80  since april 2009  the rapid growth in e20 demand is because most vehicle models launched since 2009 were e20-compatible  and sales of e20 are expected to grow faster once more local automakers start producing small  e20-compatible  fuel-efficient cars  the thai government is promoting ethanol usage through subsidies  as ethanol costs four
a litre more than gasoline 
a state law approved in
in 2005 mandates that ethanol comprise 20  of all gasoline sold in this american state beginning in 2013  successful tests have been conducted to determine the performance under e20 by current vehicles and fuel dispensing equipment designed for e10 
a study commissioned by
and published in september 2013  concluded that the use of
in the uk  and particularly e20   is a more cost-effective way of reducing emissions than using
 pevs  in the timeframe to 2030  the study also found that the use of higher blends of biofuels is complementary to
 hevs  and
 phevs  
 bevs  can deliver strong co2 savings with a decarbonised electric grid  but are expected to have significantly higher costs than
vehicles and hybrid cars to 2030  as the latter are expected to be the most popular models by 2030  according to the study  in 2030 an e20 blend in an hev can achieve a 10  emission savings compared to an hev running on e5  for an annual fuel cost premium of gb13 compared to an annual cost of gb195 for an all-electric car 
e70  e75  
when the vapor pressure in the ethanol blend drops below 45 kpa  fuel ignition cannot be guaranteed on cold winter days  limiting the maximum ethanol blend percentage during the winter months to e75 
e70 contains 70  ethanol and 30  gasoline  while e75 contains 75  ethanol  these winter blends are used in the united states and sweden for e85
during the cold weather  but still sold at the pump labeled as   the seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to an e85 winter blend is mandated to avoid cold starting problems at low temperatures 
in the us  this seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to e70 applies only in cold regions  where temperatures fall below 32  0  during the winter  in
for example  e70 is sold as e85 from october to may  in sweden  all e85 flexible-fuel vehicles use an e75 winter blend  this blend was introduced since the winter 2006-07 and e75 is used from november until march 
for temperatures below 15  5   all e85 flex vehicles require an engine block heater to avoid cold starting problems  the use of this device is also recommended for gasoline vehicles when temperatures drop below 23  9   another option when extreme cold weather is expected is to add more pure gasoline in the tank  thus reducing the ethanol content below the e70 winter blend  or simply not to use e85 during extreme low temperature spells

e85  a mixture of 85  ethanol and 15  gasoline  is generally the highest ethanol fuel mixture found in the united states and several european countries  particularly in sweden  as this blend is the standard fuel for   this mixture has an
of 94-97  which is significantly lower than pure ethanol  but still higher than normal gasoline  87-93 octane  depending on country  
logo used in the united states for

the 85  limit in the ethanol content was set to reduce ethanol emissions at low temperatures and to avoid cold starting problems during cold weather  at temperatures lower than 11c  52f   a further reduction in the ethanol content is used during the winter in regions where temperatures fall below 0c  32f  and this blend is called winter e85  as the fuel is still sold under the e85 label  a winter blend of e70 is mandated in some regions in the us  while sweden mandates e75  some regions in the united states now allow e51  51  ethanol  49  gasoline  to be sold as e85 in the winter months 
as of october 2010  nearly 3,000 e85 fuel pumps were in europe  led by sweden with 1,699 filling stations  the united states had 3,354 public e85 fuel pumps located in 2,154 cities by august 2014  mostly concentrated in the  
introduced e85 fuel by the end of 2008  and by mid-2010  only four e85 filling stations were available  with plans to expand to 15 stations by 2012 
a major restriction hampering sales of e85 flex vehicles or fuelling with e85  is the limited infrastructure available to sell e85 to the public  as by 2014 only 2 percent of motor fuel stations offered e85  up from about 1 percent in 2011  as of november 2015  there were only 3,218 gasoline fueling stations selling e85 to the public in the entire u s   while about 156,000 retail motor fuel outlets do not offer the e85 blend  the number of e85 grew from 1,229 in 2007 to 2,442 in 2011  but only increased by 7  from 2011 to 2013  when the total reached 2,625  there is a great concentration of e85 stations in the
states  and as of november 2015  the leading state is
with 274 stations  followed by
with 231 
with 225 
with 204 
with 188 
with 181 
with 152  and
with 126  only eight states do not have e85 available to the public                and   the main constraint for a more rapid expansion of e85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations  at an estimated cost of us 60,000 for each dedicated ethanol tank  a study conducted by the u s  department of energy concluded that every service station in america could be converted to handle e85 at a cost of  3.4 billion to  10.1 billion

in december 2007  and since november 2009  two ed95 buses were in regular service  the brazilian trial project ran for three years and performance and emissions were monitored by the national reference center on biomass  cenbio-   centro nacional de referncia em biomassa  at the  
in november 2010  the municipal government of
city signed an agreement with     scania and viao metropolitana  a local bus operator  to introduced a fleet of 50 ethanol-powered ed95 buses by may 2011  scania manufactures the bus engine and chassis in its plant located in   so paulo  using the same technology and fuel as the ed95 buses already operating in   the bus body is a brazilian caio  the first ethanol-powered buses were delivered in may 2011  and the 50 buses will start regular service in june 2011 in the southern region of so paulo  the 50 ed95 buses had a cost of
20 million  us 12.3 million  and due to the higher cost of the ed95 fuel and the lower energy content of ethanol as compared to diesel  one of the firms participating in the cooperation agreement  rasen  a

e100 is pure   straight
ethanol as an
fuel has been widely used in brazil since the late 1970s for neat ethanol vehicles and more recently for flexible-fuel vehicles  the ethanol fuel used in brazil is distilled close to the
mixture of 95.63 
and 4.37  water  by weight  which is approximately 3.5  water by volume  the azeotrope is the highest concentration of ethanol that can be achieved by simple fractional   the maximum water concentration according to the anp specification is 4.9 vol    approximately 6.1 weight  
the e nomenclature is not adopted in brazil  but hydrated ethanol can be tagged as e100  meaning it does not have any gasoline  because the water content is not an additive  but rather a residue from the distillation process  however  straight hydrous ethanol is also called e95 by some authors 
the first commercial vehicle capable of running on pure ethanol was the   produced from 1908 through 1927  it was fitted with a
with adjustable jetting  allowing use of gasoline or ethanol  or a combination of both  at that time  other car manufacturers also provided engines for ethanol fuel use  thereafter  and as a response to the
and   the first modern vehicle capable of running with pure
ethanol  e100  was launched in the brazilian market  the   after testing with several prototypes developed by the brazilian subsidiaries of    
and   as of september 2012  there were 1.1 million neat ethanol vehicles still in use in brazil  since 2003  brazilian newer flex-fuel vehicles are capable of running on pure hydrous ethanol  e100  or blended with any combination of e20 to e27,5 gasoline  a mixture made with anhydrous ethanol   the national mandatory blend  as of september 2012  there were 17.1 million flexible-fuel vehicles running on brazilian roads 
e100 imposes a limitation on normal vehicle operation  as ethanol s lower evaporative pressure  as compared to gasoline  causes problems when cold starting the engine at temperatures below 15  59   for this reason  both pure ethanol and e100 flex-fuel vehicles are built with an additional small gasoline reservoir inside the engine compartment to help in starting the engine when cold by initially injecting gasoline  once started  the engine is then switched back to ethanol  an improved flex-fuel engine generation was developed to eliminate the need for the secondary gas tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting  and allowing them to start at temperatures as low as 5  23   the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the brazilian territory  the   launched in march 2009  was the first flex-fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start  the warming system  called flex start  was developed by  
swedish carmakers have developed ethanol-only capable engines for the new
biopower 100 concept e100  with a v6 engine which is fuelled entirely by e100 bioethanol  and the limited edition of the   a version of the
converted to use e85 or e100  as well as standard 98-octane gasoline  and currently the fastest and most powerful flex-fuel vehicle with its twin-
producing 1018hp when running on biofuel  as compared to 806hp on 91- unleaded gasoline 
the higher fuel efficiency of e100  compared to methanol  in high performance
resulted in
races in 2007 and 2008 being run on 100  fuel-grade ethanol 
use limitations  
modifications to engines  
the use of ethanol blends in conventional gasoline vehicles is restricted to low mixtures  as ethanol is corrosive and can degrade some of the materials in the engine and fuel system  also  the engine has to be adjusted for a higher
as compared to a pure gasoline engine to take advantage of ethanol s higher oxygen content  thus allowing an improvement in fuel efficiency and a reduction of tailpipe emissions  the following table shows the required modifications to gasoline engines to run smoothly and without degrading any materials  this information is based on the modifications made by the brazilian automotive industry at the beginning of the ethanol program in that country in the late 1970s  and reflects the experience of  
required adjustments to gasoline engines to cope with different blends of ethanol fuel

disadvantages to ethanol fuel blends when used in engines designed exclusively for gasoline include lowered fuel mileage  metal corrosion  deterioration of plastic and rubber fuel system components  clogged fuel systems  fuel injectors  and carburetors  delamination of composite fuel tanks  varnish buildup on engine parts  damaged or destroyed internal engine components  water absorption  fuel phase separation  and shortened fuel storage life  many major auto  marine  motorcycle  lawn equipment  generator  and other internal combustion engine manufacturers have issued warnings and precautions about the use of ethanol-blended gasolines of any type in their engines  and the
and major aviation engine manufacturers have prohibited the use of automotive gasolines blended with ethanol in light aircraft due to safety issues from fuel system and engine damage
