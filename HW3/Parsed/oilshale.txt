oil shale  an organic-rich sedimentary rock  belongs to the group of
  it does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific chemical formula  and its seams do not always have discrete boundaries  oil shales vary considerably in their mineral content  chemical composition  age  type of kerogen  and depositional history and not all oil shales would necessarily be classified as
in the strict sense  according to the
adrian c  hutton of the   oil shales are not  geological nor geochemically distinctive rock but rather  economic  term   their common defining feature is low
in low-boiling organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on  
oil shale differs from

coals and
  while oil sands do originate from the
of oil  heat and pressure have not  yet  transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum  that means that its
does not exceed early mesocatagenetic 
general composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix  bitumens  and kerogen  while the bitumen portion of oil shales is soluble in   kerogen portion is insoluble in carbon disulfide and can contain         and   oil shale contains a lower percentage of organic matter than coal  in commercial grades of oil shale the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0.75 5 and 1.5 5  at the same time  the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon  h c  approximately 1.2 to 1.8times lower than for crude oil and about 1.5 to 3times higher than for coals  the organic components of oil shale derive from a variety of organisms  such as the remains of

as source rocks for most conventional   oil shale deposits are found in all world oil provinces  although most of them are too deep to be exploited economically  as with all oil and gas resources  analysts distinguish between oil shale resources and oil shale reserves   resources  refers to all oil shale deposits  while  reserves   represents those deposits from which producers can extract oil shale economically using existing technology  since extraction technologies develop continuously  planners can only estimate the amount of recoverable kerogen  although resources of oil shale occur in many countries  only 33countries possess known deposits of possible economic value   well-explored deposits  potentially classifiable as reserves  include the
deposits in the western united states  the tertiary deposits in   australia  deposits in
and   the el-lajjun deposit in   and deposits in france  germany    china  southern
and russia  these deposits have given rise to expectations of yielding at least 40liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale  using the

also used to polish it and form it into ornaments  the first patent for extracting oil from oil shale was british crown patent 330 granted in 1694 to three persons named martin eele  thomas hancock and william portlock who had  found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch  tarr  and oyle out of a sort of stone  
autun oil shale mines
modern industrial mining of oil shale began in 1837 in   france  followed by exploitation in scotland  germany  and several other countries 
operations during the 19th century focused on the production of   lamp oil  and   these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting that arose during the   fuel oil  lubricating oil and grease  and
were also produced  the european oil-shale industry expanded immediately before
due to limited access to conventional petroleum resources and to the mass production of automobiles and trucks  which accompanied an increase in gasoline consumption 
although the estonian and chinese oil-shale industries continued to grow after   most other countries abandoned their projects due to high processing costs and the availability of cheaper petroleum  following the   world production of oil shale reached a peak of 46million tonnes in 1980 before falling to about 16million tonnes in 2000  due to competition from

the global oil-shale industry began to revive at the beginning of the 21st century  in 2003  an oil-shale development program restarted in the united states  authorities introduced a commercial leasing program permitting the extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in 2005  in accordance with the

as of 2008  industry uses oil shale in brazil  china  estonia and to some extent in germany  and russia  several additional countries started assessing their reserves or had built experimental production plants  while others had phased out their oil shale industry  oil shale serves for oil production in estonia  brazil  and china  for power generation in estonia  china  and germany  for cement production in estonia  germany  and china  and for use in chemical industries in china  estonia  and russia

extraction and processing  
main article 
overview of shale oil extraction 
most exploitation of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere  after which one can burn the shale directly to generate electricity  or undertake further processing  the most common methods of
involve
and   these procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale  and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface    which removes less of the overlying material  employs the  
the extraction of the useful components of oil shale usually takes place above ground  ex-situ processing   although several newer technologies perform this underground  on-site or
processing   in either case  the chemical process of
converts the kerogen in the oil shale to shale oil   oil  and oil shale gas  most conversion technologies involve heating shale in the absence of
to a temperature at which kerogen decomposes  pyrolyses  into gas  condensable oil  and a solid residue  this usually takes place between 450  842  and 500  932   the process of decomposition begins at relatively low temperatures  300c or 572f   but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperatures 
in-situ processing involves heating the oil shale underground  such technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than ex-situ processes  since they can access the material at greater depths than surface mines can  several
have patented methods for in-situ retorting  however  most of these methods remain in the experimental phase  one can distinguish true in-situ processes  tis  and modified in-situ processes  mis   true in-situ processes do not involve mining the oil shale  modified in-situ processes involve removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the surface for modified in-situ retorting in order to create permeability for gas flow in a rubble chimney  explosives rubblize the oil-shale deposit 
hundreds of patents for oil shale
technologies exist  however  only a few dozen have undergone testing  by 2006  only four technologies remained in commercial use        and  
applications and products  
industry can use oil shale as a fuel for thermal power-plants  burning it  like coal  to drive   some of these plants
for
of homes and businesses  in addition to its use as a fuel  oil shale may also serve in the production of specialty            
agents  mastic  road bitumen    bricks  construction and decorative blocks  soil-additives   
insulation  glass  and pharmaceutical products  however  oil shale use for production of these items remains small or only in its experimental stages  some oil shales yield         uranium  and
as shale-oil extraction byproducts  between 1946 and 1952  a marine type of
shale served for uranium production in   estonia  and between 1950 and 1989 sweden used
shale for the same purposes  oil shale gas has served as a substitute for   but as of 2009  producing oil shale gas as a natural-gas substitute remained economically infeasible 
the shale oil derived from oil shale does not directly substitute for crude oil in all applications  it may contain higher concentrations of     and
than conventional crude oil  some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content  by comparison with   the benchmark standard for crude oil in the
market  the green river shale oil
content ranges from near 0  to 4.9   in average 0.76    where west texas intermediate s sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42   the sulfur content in shale oil from jordan s oil shales may rise even up to 9.5   the arsenic content  for example  becomes an issue for green river formation oil shale  the higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading    before serving as
feedstock  above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower
shale oil than the in situ processes  shale oil serves best for producing middle- such as     and   worldwide demand for these middle distillates  particularly for diesel fuels  increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s  however  appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon    
economics  
main article 
prices 19962009  not adjusted for inflation 
the amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown  the various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale-oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes  according to a survey conducted by the   the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the united states  comprising a mine      supporting utilities  and spent shale reclamation   would range between 7095   440600 m3  adjusted to 2005 values   this estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency  in order to run a profitable operation  the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels  the analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex  the hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 3570  after producing its first 500 million barrels  7910 6m3   assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day  4.010 3m3 d  during each year after the start of commercial production  rand predicts the costs would decline to  3548 per barrel   220300 m3  within 12 years  after achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels  16010 6m3   its costs would decline further to  3040 per barrel   190250 m3   some commentators compare the proposed american oil-shale industry to the
industry  the latter enterprise generated over 1 million barrels  160,000m3  of oil per day in late 2007   stating that  the first-generation facility is the hardest  both technically and economically  
in 2005 
announced that
could become competitive for oil prices over  30per barrel   190 m3   a 2004 report by the
stated that both the shell technology and technology used in the
could be competitive at prices above  25 per barrel  and that the
expected full-scale production to be economical at prices above  18per barrel   130 m3  
to increase efficiency when retorting oil shale  researchers have proposed and tested several co-pyrolysis processes 
a 1972 publication in the journal ptrole informations    compared shale-based oil production unfavorably with   the article portrayed coal liquefaction as less expensive  generating more oil  and creating fewer environmental impacts than extraction from oil shale  it cited a conversion ratio of 650 liters  170u s gal  140impgal  of oil per one
of coal  as against 150 liters  40u s gal  33impgal  of shale oil per one ton of oil shale 
a critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining and processing  a ratio known as  energy returned on energy invested      a 1984 study estimated the eroei of the various known oil-shale deposits as varying between 0.713.3 although known oil-shale extraction development projects assert an eroei between 3 and 10  according to the world energy outlook 2010  the eroei of ex-situ processing is typically 4 to 5 while of in-situ processing it may be even as low as 2  however  according to the iea most of used energy can be provided by burning the spent shale or oil-shale gas 
the water needed in the oil shale retorting process offers an additional economic consideration  this may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity 
environmental considerations  
main article 
mining oil shale involves a number of environmental impacts  more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining  these include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent
of formerly buried materials  the introduction of metals including
into surface-water and groundwater  increased   sulfur-gas emissions  and air pollution caused by the production of
during processing  transport  and support activities  in 2002  about 97  of air pollution  86  of total waste and 23  of water pollution in estonia came from the power industry  which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production 
oil-shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area  combustion and thermal processing generate waste material  in addition  the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include   a   environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale  as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels  section 526 of the energy independence and security act prohibits united states government agencies from buying oil produced by processes that produce more greenhouse gas emissions than would traditional petroleum  experimental in situ conversion processes and
technologies may reduce some of these concerns in the future  but at the same time they may cause other problems  including
pollution  among the water contaminants commonly associated with oil shale processing are oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons  commonly detected examples include
derivatives    and various alkyl homologues of pyridine      
some have expressed concerns over the oil shale industry s use of water  in 2002  the oil shale-fired power industry used 91  of the water consumed in estonia  depending on technology  above-ground retorting uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil  a 2008 programmatic
issued by the us
stated that surface mining and retort operations produce 2 to 10 u s  gallons  7.6 to 37.9l  1.7 to 8.3impgal  of waste water per 1 short ton  0.91t  of processed oil shale  in situ processing  according to one estimate  uses about one-tenth as much water 
water concerns become particularly sensitive issues in arid regions  such as the western us and israel s   where plans exist to expand oil-shale extraction despite a water shortage 
activists  including members of   have organized strong protests against the oil shale industry  in one result 
put the proposed
in australia on hold in 2004 
extraterrestrial oil shale  
some comets contain  massive amounts of an organic material almost identical to high grade oil shale   the equivalent of cubic kilometers of such mixed with other material  for instance  corresponding hydrocarbons were detected in a probe fly-by through the tail of comet halley during 1986
