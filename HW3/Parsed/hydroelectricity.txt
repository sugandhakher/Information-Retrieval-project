power producing facility of any kind 
part of a series about
hydroelectricity
hydroelectricity is
from   in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6  of the world s total electricity and 70  of all   and was expected to increase about 3.1  each year for the next 25 years 
hydropower is produced in 150 countries  with the
region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 
is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with 920 twh of production in 2013  representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use 
the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low  making it a competitive source of renewable electricity  the hydro station consumes no water  unlike coal or gas plants  the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10
is 3 to 5
per   with a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands  once a hydroelectric complex is constructed  the project produces no direct waste  and has a considerably lower output level of
than

hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks  in the mid-1770s  french engineer
published architecture hydraulique which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines  by the late 19th century  the
was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics  the growing demand for the
would drive development as well  in 1878 the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at

near
in the u s  side began to produce electricity in 1881  the first
hydroelectric power station  the   began operating september 30  1882  in   with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts  by 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the u s  and canada  by 1889 there were 200 in the u s  alone 
at the beginning of the 20th century  many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas    france held the
with over one million visitors  by 1920 as 40  of the power produced in the united states was hydroelectric  the
was enacted into law  the act created the
to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water  as the power stations became larger  their associated dams developed additional purposes to include  
and   federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations  such as the
 1933  and the
 1937  were created  additionally  the
which had begun a series of western u s  irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928   the
was also involved in hydroelectric development  completing the
in 1937 and being recognized by the
as the premier federal flood control agency 
hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century  hydropower was referred to as white coal for its power and plenty   s initial 1,345 mw power station was the world s largest hydroelectric power station in 1936  it was eclipsed by the 6809 mw
in 1942  the
opened in 1984 in south america as the largest  producing 14,000 mw but was surpassed in 2008 by the
in china at 22,500 mw  hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries  including    
and   with over 85  of their electricity  the united states currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4  of its total electrical production output  which is 49  of its renewable electricity

pumped-storage
main article 
see also 
this method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between
at different elevations  at times of low electrical demand  the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir  when the demand becomes greater  water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine  pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale
and improve the daily
of the generation system  pumped storage is not an energy source  and appears as a negative number in listings 
run-of-the-river
main article 
see also 
run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity  so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment  and any oversupply must pass unused  a constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river  in the united states  run of the river hydropower could potentially provide 60,000 megawatts  80,000,000hp   about 13.7  of total use in 2011 if continuously available

a
station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides  such sources are highly predictable  and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs  can also be
to generate power during high demand periods  less common types of hydro schemes use water s
or undammed sources such as undershot   tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world  in great britain  there are eight sites that could be developed  which have the potential to generate 20  of the electricity used in 2012

large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world  with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current  
although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations  facilities from over a few hundred
are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities

main article 
small hydro is the development of
on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant  the definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10
 mw  is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro  this may be stretched to 25 mw and 30 mw in
and the   small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 28  during 2008 from 2005  raising the total world small-hydro capacity to 85   over 70  of this was in

small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy  alternatively  small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network  or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network  since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work  they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro  this decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production 
micro
main article 
micro hydro is a term used for
installations that typically produce up to 100
of power  these installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community  or are sometimes connected to electric power networks  there are many of these installations around the world  particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel  micro hydro systems complement
solar energy systems because in many areas  water flow  and thus available hydro power  is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum 
pico
main article 
pico hydro is a term used for
generation of under 5   it is useful in small  remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity  for example  to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a tv or radio for a few homes  even smaller turbines of 200-300w may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only 1m  3ft   a pico-hydro setup is typically   meaning that dams are not used  but rather pipes divert some of the flow  drop this down a gradient  and through the turbine before returning it to the stream

properties
advantages
the
can generate 360
of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising 
flexibility
hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands  hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes  it takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load  this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants  power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation  hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs  instead  it serves as backup for non-hydro generators 
low cost high value power
the major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for
as high value clean electricity  the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u s  cents per kilowatt-hour  when used as peak power to meet demand  hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to  
hydroelectric stations have long economic lives  with some plants still in service after 50100 years  operating labor cost is also usually low  as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation 
where a dam serves multiple purposes  a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost  providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation  it has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the
will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation  additionally  some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return  unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place 
suitability for industrial applications
while many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks  some are created to serve specific
enterprises  dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for
electrolytic plants  for example  the
switched to support
aluminium in  
for american
airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens  in addition to aluminium power  after the war  in   the
was constructed to provide electricity for the
aluminium industry   s
was constructed to supply electricity to the
at  
reduced co2 emissions
since hydroelectric dams do not burn fossil fuels  they do not directly produce   while some carbon dioxide is produced during manufacture and construction of the project  this is a tiny fraction of the operating emissions of equivalent fossil-fuel electricity generation  one measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the externe project by the
and the
which was funded by the   according to that study  hydroelectricity produces the least amount of
and
of any energy source  coming in second place was   third was   and fourth was
  the low
impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in   the above study was for local energy in   presumably similar conditions prevail in north america and northern asia  which all see a regular  natural freeze thaw cycle  with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth   greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of
than those in temperate areas 
other uses of the reservoir
reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for   and become tourist attractions themselves  in some countries 
in reservoirs is common 
installed for
support
with a relatively constant water supply  large hydro dams can control floods  which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project 
disadvantages
see also 
ecosystem damage and loss of land
hydroelectric power stations that use
would submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a  
in  
large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams  sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests  marshland and grasslands  damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems  and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife  the loss of land is often exacerbated by
of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir 
hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic
both upstream and downstream of the plant site  generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment  water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment  which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks  since turbine gates are often opened intermittently  rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed 
siltation and flow shortage
when water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream  this has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations  particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation 
can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam  eventually  some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail 
changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam  lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity  the result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power  the risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of   one study from the
in the united states suggest that modest climate changes  such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree celsius resulting in a 10  decline in precipitation  might reduce river run-off by up to 40  
in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity  as increasing temperatures  lower water ow and alterations in the rainfall regime  could reduce total energy production by 7  annually by the end of the century 
methane emissions  from reservoirs 
the
in the
is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility  with an installed capacity of 2,080  
see also 
lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions  as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of   this is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an
environment  and forming methane  a   according to the
report  where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity  less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area  and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir  greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant 
in
reservoirs of canada and northern europe  however 
are typically only 2  to 8  of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation  a new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay 
relocation
another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned  in 2000  the world commission on dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide 
failure risks
see also 
and
because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water  a failure due to poor construction  natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure 
during typhoon nina in 1975
failed in southern china when more than a year s worth of rain fell within 24 hours  the resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people  and another 145,000 from epidemics  millions were left homeless 
the creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at
in italy  where almost 2,000 people died 
the
failure in
on the
 cte d azur   southern france  collapsed on december 2  1959  killing 423 people in the resulting flood 
smaller dams and
facilities create less risk  but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned  for example  the small
failed in 1977  causing 39 deaths with the toccoa flood  twenty years after its power station was decommissioned the earthen embankment dam failed 
comparison with other methods of power generation
hydroelectricity eliminates the   including pollutants such as       dust  and
in the   hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of
and the indirect health effects of coal emissions  compared to   hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint  and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure  the creation of   for example  required native american land to create lake sakakawea  which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles  and caused the inhabitants to sell 94  of their arable land for  7.5 million in 1949 
compared to   hydroelectricity power stations have a more predictable load factor  if the project has a storage reservoir  it can generate power when needed  hydroelectric stations can be easily regulated to follow variations in power demand
