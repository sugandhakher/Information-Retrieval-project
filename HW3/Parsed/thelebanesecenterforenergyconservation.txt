history  
back in 2002  the ministry of energy and water  mew  and united nations development programme  undp  in signed an agreement to create a new project called cross-sectoral energy efficiency and removal of barriers to esco operation  the project was co-funded by
and the ministry of energy and water and under the direct management of undp lebanon 
one main objective of this project was to create a national energy agency for lebanon to be called the lebanese center for energy conservation  lcec   the project team started its operation in early 2005  and gradually the project name changed to lcec  the lcec project succeeded in implementing a number of activities to push for energy efficiency development in lebanon  gradually  lcec gradually established itself as an independent technical national center offering the lebanese government and more specifically the ministry of energy and water all kinds of services dedicated to energy efficiency and renewable energy 
the role of the lcec project was consolidated as an independent technical national center in the memorandum of understanding  mou  that signed between mew and undp on 18 june 2007  gef and undp extended their support to the lcec in 2009 until the end of 2013 
in 2011  lcec finally achieved to stand out as an independent organization affiliated to the ministry of energy and water and is now financially and administratively independent  lcec operates under the direct supervision of the lebanese minister of energy and water 
in 2013  the financial and administrative support of gef and undp to lcec came to an end  during that same year  lcec received its first financial support from the lebanese ministry of energy and water  mew   the mew support ensured the sustainability of the center for a minimum of 5 years  lcec also benefits from the support of the european union  eu  through a contract signed with the central bank of lebanon  bdl  
what does lcec do   
lcec has established itself as a technical point of reference specialized in
issues within the lebanese ministry of energy and water  lcec targets fundamental energy issues 
lcec works on setting national strategies and action plans to be adopted by the lebanese government  lcec also works on the implementation and the quality control of national projects and initiatives in the country  moreover  lcec is involved in the update and development of the legal and administrative framework needed for the greening of the energy sector  until date  lcec has implemented numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and initiatives that have resulted in many positive changes within the lebanese society and economy 
the main driver of the lcec is the national energy efficiency action plan  neeap  that summarizes the national efforts in energy efficiency and renewable energy  at   lebanon voluntarily pledged to increase the renewable energy share to 12  by 2020  this voluntary commitment was anchored within the policy paper for the electricity sector prepared by the ministry of energy and water and officially adopted by the council of ministers in june 2010  the policy paper includes ten strategic initiatives for the improvement of infrastructure  supply and demand systems and the definition of legal framework  two key initiatives target respectively the renewable energy and the demand side management  energy efficiency 
following this  lcec developed the neeap lebanon 2011-2015 which was adopted in august 2010 by the ministry of energy and water and approved in november 2011 by the lebanese government  neeap summarizes all national objectives  programmes and policies in 14 independent but correlated initiatives in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors  neeap was prepared in conformance with the arab ee guideline  based on the eu directive 2006/32 ec on energy end-use efficiency and energy service  and lebanon was the first arab country to officially adopt such plan  lcec is currently updating the neeap while preparing the renewable energy strategy for lebanon that will include several scenarios in achieving the set target of 12  re by 2020 and that will also be in accordance with the arab renewable energy guideline under preparation 
moreover  lcec provides both the public and private sector with expert advice  finance and accreditation  develops energy efficiency standards and labels  and provides national energy database indicators 
partnerships  
the work of lcec is characterized by various partnerships with national and international private and public entities 
the ministry of energy and water is the central public organization in charge of the energy sector in lebanon  lcec is affiliated to the ministry of energy and water in all major decisions  initiatives and projects related to energy efficiency and renewable energy 
lcec is also the technical partner of the
 bdl  in the review and evaluation of all technical applications to low-interest energy loans submitted to bdl 
policy development

cfl pilot project in niha  bekaa  
based on a collaboration agreement signed between lcec and   edz installed around 1,048
in the village of niha in the
area  completely free-of-charge  the 1,048 cfls were purchased by lcec and the installation was offered free-of-charge by edz as an in-kind contribution 
the direct objective of the pilot project is to reduce the energy bill of the different consumers and therefore remove part of the financial burden on families in this area  another major objective is the reduction of ghg emissions generated by inefficient lighting  in addition  setting this project as a success story supported by real achieved savings can increase the market share of energy efficient lighting in lebanon and consequently boost the market toward the phase out of incandescent bulbs in the country  this strategy goes with the different strategies followed by many countries in     and   finally  the project shall achieve a percentage of dollars savings in the national energy bill 
there are two very important reasons for which the project has chosen edz for this installation  edz is a professional electrical utility that has online control on the electricity consumption in each and every house  this means that edz is able to track the changes in the energy bills resulting from the project implementation and can therefore report on the measurement and savings in kwh and in dollars  the second reason is that the management at edz is ready to support this program financially at a later stage 
following a site survey done by edz  lcec supplied around 1,048 cfl s of different sizes to edz with a total cost not exceeding 2,500 usd 
due to the importance of this pilot project  the event was covered by the media in every aspect  in fact  a press release was distributed to the main newspapers in town  namely       and   in addition  the project was covered by two main television stations in lebanon  namely
and ntv 
recently  lcec in collaboration with edz has worked on developing a complete study report on the success of this project  one year after its completion  the results of the study will be published soon by lcec 
these pilot projects are preparing the ground towards implanting a clear dsm strategy developing currently  the strategy shall target the installation of a massive number of cfl fixtures all over lebanon 
chinese government grant - phase 2  
after the success of the 500 solar water heaters donated by the peoples republic of china and subsequent to the israelis attacks in july 2006 leading to the destruction of 200 of units earlier that year  the lcec and the ministry of energy   water  mew  have been closely coordinating with the chinese government to proceed with a phase 2 grant that will include 600 solar water heaters of similar capacity and type of phase 1  208 l tank capacity and 28 glass tubes

lcec was engaged in the public street lighting project and managed the installation of 500 solar street lights at the end of december 2014 through a grant by the chinese government in the dora  jounieh  cornet chehwan and batroun areas 
french fasep initiative for solar photovoltaic educational platform  
the educational and demonstration platform for renewable energies in lebanon  project is a joint initiative between the french company transnergie and the ministry of energy and water represented by lcec with the direct support of the industrial research institute  iri  and undp lebanon  it aims at the installation of an educational platform to be used by researchers  educational institutions  university students  as well as professionals in the solar photovoltaic sector 
global solar water heating market transformation and strengthening initiative  
a main component of lcecs work is the gef-funded project global solar water heating market transformation and strengthening initiative aiming at the installation of around 190,000 square meters of solar water heaters  swhs  during the timeline of the project from 2010 till the end of 2014  another aim of the project is to help the market reach a total annual sale of 50,000 m2 and the installation of 1,050,000 square meters of swhs capacity by 2020  to achieve these goals  the project worked on pilot installation of solar water heating  on training engineers and technicians  advertisement and marketing  and all other aspects that affect the solar water heating market growth 
till july 2014  a total of 5,878 installations were approved for swh loans  and 49.63  of which benefited from the usd 200 subsidy  in total  33,239 systems sold between 2012 and 2013 
moreover  lcec provides both the public and private sector with expert advice  finance and accreditation  develops energy efficiency standards and labels  and provides national energy database indicators 
esco companies  
since 2001  a nationwide program on energy audits for medium and large consuming facilities was initiated  this was a project financed by the global environment facility  gef   managed by the united nations development programme  undp   and called lebanon cross sectoral energy efficiency and removal of barriers to esco operation  the initial period 2002-2004 saw delays in project implementation  consequently  the project was essentially restarted with a new project team in 2005 and was operational until the end of 2009  the project was mainly targeting the high combined consumption of energy in industrial plants and buildings  where the potential for energy savings is important and promising  in 2006  lcec aimed and worked on creating a market for escos  energy service companies that offer energy efficiency improvement services  where the end user can request a specialized esco to conduct an energy audit 
over 125 audits were completed within the project  mostly for large facilities 
only one esco was operational at the beginning of the programme  in 2010 only 8 escos where active  nowadays more than 30 are available and the market is still expanding rapidly  to further support the growth of the escos market  lcec launched an initiative in neaap called paving the way for energy audit and esco business  the purpose of this initiative is to support the development of the esco working in the energy audit business and provide them with the suitable financial  fiscal and technical incentives to remove all the obstacles hindering their growth  to support this initiative  lcec has offered periodical trainings  workshops and seminars on energy audit activities and procedures to technician  engineers  bankers and to all those involved in the field  the esco pre-qualification programme was launched by lcec by 2014 in order to regulate the market and have a recommended list of companies for potential projects 
financing  
the national energy efficiency and renewable energy action  neerea  is a green financing mechanism that allows private sector entities to apply to subsidized loans for any type of ee and or re projects  the loan has a ceiling of 20 million usd and is offered at an interest rate of 0.6  for 14 years  the greens loans are provided through any of the lebanese commercial banks to directly reach the end user  the european union is contributing to neerea by offering a grant over a share of the investment cost of maximum 5 million usd  15  for nonsubsidized sectors and 5  for subsidized sectors 
by january 2015  more than 200 projects were approved under the neerea financing mechanism with a total amount of more than 200 million usd  results show that around 60  of the projects were for solar photovoltaic while 82  of loans amount were for green buildings
