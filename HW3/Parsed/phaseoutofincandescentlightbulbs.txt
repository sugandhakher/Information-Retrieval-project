governments around the world have passed measures to phase out incandescent light bulbs for general lighting in favor of more energy-efficient lighting alternatives  phase-out regulations effectively ban the manufacture  importation or sale of
for general lighting  the regulations would allow sale of future versions of incandescent bulbs if they are sufficiently energy efficient 
brazil and venezuela started the controversial phase-out in 2005    and the   switzerland  and australia started to phase them out in 2009  likewise  other nations are implementing new energy standards or have scheduled phase-outs  argentina  and russia in 2012  and the united states  canada  mexico  malaysia and south korea in 2014 
objections to replacement of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs  to mitigate the effects of these concerns  various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products  manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs  and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release  new lamp types offer improved starting characteristics  and dimmable types are available

alternatives to incandescent bulbs  
the light from an incandescent source is similar in character to that from a
in spectral distribution  that is  the bulb  as the filament heats up  produces light from wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum  alternative light sources use phosphors or combinations of mono-chromatic leds  red  blue  green  to produce  white  light  giving significantly irregular spectral distributions which can result in color casts in photography and differences of color matching when compared to incandescent light or daylight   
are a type of incandescent lamp with improved efficiency over regular incandescent lamps  though not as energy efficient as other alternatives  they are up to 40 percent more efficient than standard incandescent lamps designed for a 2000-hour life  depending on size  voltage  and designed life  small low-voltage halogen lamps can have 70  higher efficacy than large line-voltage lamps  the high operating temperature of halogen bulbs may be a safety hazard in some applications 
a
 cfl  uses a fluorescent lamp tube which is curved or folded to fit into the space of an incandescent bulb and contains a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp  compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light  cfls use one-fifth to one-third the electric power  and may last eight to fifteen times longer  newer
formulations have improved the perceived color  with  soft white  cfls judged subjectively similar to standard incandescent lamps  objections more specifically relating to compact fluorescent light bulbs include the different quality of light produced by phosphor-based lamps compared to incandescent lamps and that compact fluorescent light bulbs contain small amounts of   a potent neurotoxin  which is especially dangerous to children and pregnant women  and made more serious by the confined area mercury would be dispersed in the event of a breakage indoors  environmental concerns about mercury contamination from cfls have been raised  but cfls can be shown to result in less mercury in the environment compared to traditional incandescent bulbs due to the significant reductions in power plant emissions  thus  use of energy-efficient bulbs can actually reduce the amount of mercury released into the environment 
start poorly when very cold  and most types cannot be dimmed  a few specialist applications are unsuitable for cfls 
are used for both general and special-purpose lighting  compared to fluorescent bulbs  advantages are that they contain no mercury  they turn on instantly at any temperature  their extremely long lifetime is unaffected by cycling on and off  they have no glass to break  they don t emit uv rays that fade colored materials  led lamps radiate almost no heat  and can be either multi-directional or uni-directional  eliminating the need for a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture  led lamps can emit
colored light  disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors  and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs 
magnetic
use a magnetic field to excite mercury to give off uv light  which is converted to visible light by a phosphor coating  they can last 15,000 hours and produce more than 60   the technology has been used in industrial lighting since 1990 
regional developments  
phase out of incandescent light bulbs around the world
a full ban
a partial ban
a programme to exchange a number of light bulbs with more efficient types
africa  
south africa  
south africa is in stage of phasing out incandescent light bulbs in 2016 
zambia  
since january 2016 the importation of incandescent light bulbs has been banned in zambia 
asia  
people s republic of china  
china will ban imports and sales of certain incandescent light bulbs starting october 2012 to encourage the use of alternative lighting sources such as
 leds   with a 5-year plan of phasing-out incandescent light bulbs over 100 watts starting 1 october 2012  and gradually extend the ban to those over 15 watts on 1 october 2016  another source  however  has indicated that by 1 october 2016  all incandescent light bulbs will be banned  according to this source  1 november 2011 to 30 september 2012 will be a transitional period and as of 1 october 2012  imports and sales of ordinary incandescent bulbs of 100 watts or more will be prohibited  the first phase will be followed by a ban on 60-watt-and-higher incandescent light bulbs starting in october 2014  by october 2016  all incandescent light bulbs will be banned in china  the final phase may be adjusted according to the results of interim assessment from october 2015 to october 2016 
india  
while not a complete ban  the plan was to replace 770 million incandescent light bulbs with led by 2019 under ujala scheme under piyush goyal leadership  the energy savings and resultant carbon emissions savings is expected to be around 110 million tonnes per year and reduce the energy consumption  only on the lighting side  street and home lights   by 112 billion units or 11,000 crore units resulting in a savings of 40,000 crore for the consumers or about  6.5 billion in electricity bills of consumers 
the states of
and
in india have banned the use of incandescent bulbs in government departments  public sector undertakings  various boards  cooperative institutions  local bodies  and institutions running on government aid 
philippines  
in february 2008  president
called for a ban of incandescent light bulbs by 2010 in favor of more energy-efficient
globes to help cut greenhouse gas emissions and household costs during her closing remarks at the philippine energy summit  once put in effect  the country will be the first in asia to do so 
malaysia  
the government will stop all production  import and sales of incandescent light bulbs by or before january 2014  as part of efforts to save power and to help cut greenhouse gas emissions 
israel  
phase out of 60w and over incandescent light bulbs has been implemented from 1 january 2012  as a measure to increase awareness a national awareness campaign has been initiated by the ministry of energy where three cfls will be sold at a subsidized price to the public 
europe  
european union  
the uk government announced in 2007 that incandescent bulbs would be phased out by 2011  in 2008  the irish government announced a phase-out of the sale of any light bulbs with a luminous efficiency of less than 16 lumens per watt  shortly afterwards  all
agreed to a progressive phase-out of incandescent light bulbs by 2012  the initial europe wide ban only applied to general-purpose  non-directional incandescent bulbs  so did not affect any bulbs with reflective surfaces  e g 
and   or special purpose bulbs including those used in devices such as household appliances  traffic lights  infrared lamps and   the sale of the most inefficient bulbs was phased out  the first types to go were non-clear  frosted  bulbs  which were taken off the market in september 2009  also from september 2009 clear bulbs over 100 w were made of more efficient types  this limit was moved down to lower wattages  and the efficiency levels raised by the end of 2012 
in practice  some manufacturers and retailers have found a loophole in the new rules so that some incandescents are still available  marketed as  rough-service  or  shock-resistant  bulbs for industrial use only  such bulbs are widely available in
and
at much lower cost than official alternatives such as cfls  they also offer improved safety for users by having a faster reaction time  and so users can see
when entering a room for example  since first bans were introduced however  prices of these bulbs have risen by 2025   a german importer simply reclassified the lamps as  mini heaters  branded     but that was banned shortly afterwards 
the eu set a target of 2016 to phase out
with two directives ec 244/2009 and ec 1194/2012  the phase out of the first directive ec 244/2009 originally planned for september 2016 was delayed until september 2018  the second directive ec 1194/2012 was upheld  as part of a review of the lighting directive four criteria needed to be assessed before a phase-out could be confirmed  issues of affordability were under scrutiny  as well as performance  equivalence to existing models and compatibility  the eu confirmed that there was absolutely no reason to delay the ban on mains voltage directional halogen lamps  as all four of the criteria had been sufficiently met  the directive ec 1194/2012 relates to mains voltage directional halogen lamps and means many common halogen reflector lamps such as d rated gu10 s are affected 
norway  
norway has implemented the eu directive for the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs and has followed the same phase out route as the eu  there was a half-year delay in implementing the directive compared to the eu  but the phase out occurred at the same time since the affected light bulbs were no longer available from european sources 
switzerland  
switzerland banned the sale of all light bulbs of the
f and g  which affects a few types of incandescent light bulbs  most normal light bulbs are of energy efficiency class e  and the swiss regulation has exceptions for various kinds of special-purpose and decorative bulbs 
north america  
canada  
the provincial government of
stated in february 2007 that it would like to move towards preventing the sale of incandescent light bulbs in the province 
in april 2007   s
announced the provincial government s intention to ban the sale of incandescent light bulbs by 2012  later in april  the federal government announced that it would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs nationwide by 2012 as part of a plan to cut down on emissions of greenhouse gases 
on 9 nov 2011  the federal government approved a proposal to delay new energy efficiency standards for light bulbs until 1 january 2014  when it will become illegal to import inefficient incandescent lighting across the country  in december 2011  ontario energy minister  chris bentley  confirmed that ontario is scrapping the five-year-old plan  to avoid confusing consumers  
the
program  in which
is a partner  in march 2008 established rules for labelling lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency  starting time  life expectancy  colour  and consistency of performance  the intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns about efficient light bulbs due to variable quality of products  those cfls with a recent energy star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker 
in january 2011  the province of british columbia banned retailers from ordering 75- or 100-watt incandescent bulbs 
canada s energy efficiency regulations are published on the natural resources canada website 
the canadian federal government banned the import and sale of 75- and 100-watt incandescent bulbs  effective 1 january 2014  on 1 january 2015  40- and 60-watt bulbs were also banned  retailers will be allowed to sell their existing inventories imported before the bans 
cuba  
cuba exchanged all incandescent light bulbs for cfls  and banned the sale and import of them in 2005   
united states

california will phase out the use of incandescent bulbs by 2018  the bill aims to establish a minimum standard of twenty-five lumens per watt by 2013 and sixty lumens per watt by 2018 
in
legislation was proposed 
a bill was introduced in
in 2007 that calls for the state to eliminate incandescent bulbs in government buildings over the next three years 
federal legislation  
this section needs to be updated  please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information   february 2016 
in december 2007  the federal government enacted the   which contains legislation to make incandescent light bulbs more efficient by setting maximum wattage requirements for all general service
producing 3102600
of light  light bulbs outside of this range are exempt from the restrictions  also exempt are several classes of specialty lights  including appliance lamps  rough service bulbs    colored lamps  stage lighting  plant lights  candelabra lights under 60 watts  outdoor post lights less than 100 watts  nightlights and shatter resistant bulbs  this effectively banned the manufacturing or importing of most incandescent bulbs of that time 
the timeline for these standards was to start in january 2012  by 2020  a second tier of restrictions would become effective  which require all general-purpose bulbs to produce at least 45 lumens per watt  similar to current cfls  
the  s
program in march 2008 established rules for labeling lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency  starting time  life expectancy  color  and consistency of performance  the intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns about efficient light bulbs due to variable quality of products  those cfls with a recent energy star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker

in 2011 
house members introduced a
or bulb act  h r  91   which would have repealed subtitle b of title iii of the energy independence and security act of 2007  h r  2417 failed to pass in the  
on 16 december 2011  the u s  house passed the final
legislation  which effectively delayed the implementation until october 2012 
in 2014 the spending bill proposed by the house would block   the energy efficiency standards in the   which would have made incandescent light bulbs obsolete 
oceania  
australia  
in february 2007  australia enacted a law that will  in effect  by legislating efficiency standards  disallow most sales of incandescent light bulbs by 2010  the australian federal government announced minimum energy performance standards  meps  for lighting products  the new minimum standard efficiency level is   from november 2008  no non-compliant lighting  including some incandescent globes  were imported into australia  and from november 2009  the retail sale of non-compliant lighting was banned 
according to the current proposal  all regular light bulbs and some other kinds of light bulbs sold from october 2009 have to meet the new minimum energy performance standards  incandescent light bulbs that meet the new standards  for example high-efficiency halogen bulbs  continue to be available 
it is estimated that
emissions will be cut by 800,000 tonnes  australia s current emission total is 564.7 million tonnes   a saving of approximately 0.14  
there have been some initiatives to encourage people to switch to compact fluorescent lamps ahead of the phase out 
new zealand  
in february 2007  then climate change minister   labour party  announced a similar proposal to the one in australia  except that importation for personal use would have been allowed  however  this proposal was scrapped by the new government in december 2008 
south america  
argentina  
in argentina  selling and importing incandescent light bulbs has been forbidden since 31 december 2010 
brazil  
as specified in interministerial ordinance 1,007 of 31 december 2010  incandescent light bulbs must perform according to certain levels of
in order to be produced  imported and sold in brazil  non-conforming light bulbs are being gradually phased out  as of july 2013  bulbs ranging from 61 to 100 watts which do not perform accordingly can no longer be produced nor imported  but until mid-2014 they can still be sold 
since end of june 2016 it has been completely prohibited in brazil 
chile  
the chilean government has prohibited the manufacture  import and sale of incandescent bulbs since december 2015 
venezuela  
as part of its electricity conservation program  venezuela has a light bulb exchange program  which aims to replace millions of incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescents 
public opposition  
the phase out has been referred to as  light bulb socialism   the consumer preference for light bulbs in the eu is for incandescent bulbs  with many complaining about what was described as the ugliness or the cold  flat  unnatural  dull light emanating from cfls  objection has also been raised to being forced to adopt cfls 
of incandescent bulbs was reported ahead of the eu lightbulb ban  many retailers in britain  poland  austria  germany and hungary have reported   and in germany  sales rose by up to 150  in 2009 in comparison to 2008  two-thirds of austrians surveyed stated they believe the phase-out to be  nonsensical   with 53.6  believing their health to be at risk of mercury poisoning  72  of americans believe the government has no right to dictate which light bulb they may use  the czech republic president    urged people to
enough incandescent bulbs to last their lifetime 
museums and individuals have been stockpiling incandescent lightbulbs in europe  owing to cfls  inferior colour representation  the
 anec  has called for a speedy reduction of the
levels contained within cfls from the current 5 limit to 1mg  the   beuc  said that phasing out incandescent bulbs will be detrimental for people suffering light-related health issues  and called for the continued availability of incandescent bulbs 
the eu regulation falls short of the needs of some consumers who need to use the old-style light bulbs for health-related reasons such as light sensitivity  we call on the european commission to take immediate measures to ensure that people who rely on incandescent light bulbs will be able to buy these bulbs until suitable alternative lighting technologies are available  there are also concerns about the risks to health from the high mercury content of the new bulbs 
a campaign group called spectrum was formed by the charities lupus uk  eclipse support group  es-uk  xp support group and the skin care campaign as an  alliance for light sensitivity  to oppose  uk and eu plans to phase out incandescent lightbulbs   their campaign has been picked up and amplified by the british association of dermatologists  calling for access to incandescent light bulbs for those who are medically sensitive to cfls and other non-incandescent bulbs  and the charity migraine action  stating that its members still suffer adverse effects from cfls despite protestations from the light bulb industry 
in the united states  one supporter of the incandescent light bulb is the lighting designer howard brandston  a fellow of the
and honorary fellow of the   he has attempted to raise awareness of what he believes are negative effects of the phase out through media outlets and industry forums  and he was invited as one of six experts to testify before the u s  senate committee on energy and natural resources on 11 march 2011 
environmental and health concerns  
main article 
cfls  like all   contain small amounts of   as both vapor and droplets inside the glass tubing  averaging 4.0mg per bulb  the inclusion of liquid mercury is specifically prohibited from other domestic products in some jurisdictions  notably europe 
of broken compact fluorescent lamps is different from cleanup of conventional broken glass or incandescent bulbs  after a proper cleanup  any potential short term exposure offers no significant health risks to adults  including pregnant women  or to children  if all electricity was generated by a coal power plant  which produce about half the electricity the u s  consumes  and
were all recycled with no mercury being lost  nearly 75  less mercury could be released in power plant emissions if incandescent bulbs were replaced by fluorescents  and with significantly less total mercury release even if no recycling occurred  however  a concern is that broken bulbs will introduce the mercury directly into a populated indoor area  though more recent analysis indicates that the concerns about mercury release from broken bulbs may be overstated  and can be ameliorated by taking a few simple steps 
no mercury is used in the manufacturing of   a different technology replacement for incandescent lamps  in addition 
do not require warmup time in cold weather  and in fact  perform better in colder temperatures  making them an excellent choice for use in cold locations  such as refrigeration units 
cost  
the initial cost of cfls and leds are higher than that of incandescent light bulbs  typically this extra cost is repaid in the long-term  as both use less energy and have longer operating lives than incandescent bulbs  when bulbs are used infrequently  such as in little-used closets and attics  it may take a long time to compensate for the higher initial cost of the bulb 
heating and cooling  
main article 
the overall energy savings from changing to more efficient lighting depends on the climate  in warm climates  efficient lighting has the additional energy-saving effect of reducing the amount of cooling required  in cold climates increased heating energy demand may offset some of the lighting energy saved with efficient lighting  a report published in january 2008 found that in   where incandescent lighting results in increased air conditioning  electricity savings would pay for the initial cost of cfls four times faster than in   where incandescent lighting contributes to space heating  in all climates  there is a net cost saving from changing to compact fluorescent lighting  the cost of cfl and led bulbs has declined greatly since 2008  which shortens the time needed to pay off their initial cost 
while the excessive heat produced by incandescent light bulbs is frequently seen as a drawback  in certain applications it is seen as an advantage  for example  automotive applications in cold climates benefit from the radiated heat as it melts potentially visually-obstructive snow and ice on warning lights and signs  the heat is also used to melt the wax inside  
dimmers  
some cfls may not be compatible with existing dimming circuits such as those using   although more dimmable cfls are expected to become available as the phase-outs continue  mains voltage
provide a more efficient dimmable alternative to common incandescent bulbs and are readily available 
dimmable led lamps are available from several vendors  although not all led lamps are compatible with dimmers and their color temperature may not lower  as it does with incandescents
