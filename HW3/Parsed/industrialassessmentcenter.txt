there are 24 industrial assessment centers in the   these centers are located at universities across the us  and are funded by the
 doe  to spread ideas relating to industrial  
the centers conduct research into energy conservation techniques for industrial applications  this is accomplished by performing energy audits or assessments at manufacturers near the particular center  the iac program has achieved of over  4.5 billion of implemented energy cost savings since its inception

history  
industrial assessment centers  formerly called the energy analysis and diagnostic center  eadc  program  were created by the
in 1976 and later moved to the doe  the iac program is administered through the advanced manufacturing office under the   the centers were created to help small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use  ineffective production procedures  excess waste production  and other production-related problems  according to instructions from doe  currently the centers are only required to focus on reducing wasted energy and increasing energy efficiency  while this remains the primary focus of the assessments  waste reduction and productivity improvements are still commonly recommended 
other benefits  
in addition to providing technical support to small to mid-sized manufacturers through energy assessments  the iac program offers several other important benefits  apart from the routine energy audits which cover a broad scope of industrial settings and subsystems  the iacs provide technical material and workshops promoting energy efficiency 
iac database
rutgers university maintains a large databases of energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector  the database contains recommendations from every audit completed by an iac dating back to 1980  as of june 2016  the iac program had finished 17,400 assessments and made over 132,000 recommendations  this database is free and open to the public 
iac alumni
the iac program helps train the next generation of energy efficiency engineers  hundreds of students participate in the program each year  and over 56  of those students pursue careers in energy or energy efficiency
