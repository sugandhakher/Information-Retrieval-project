cost factors  
while calculating costs  several internal cost factors have to be considered   note the use of  costs   which is not the actual selling price  since this can be affected by a variety of factors such as subsidies and taxes  
capital costs  including
disposal and
costs for nuclear energy  - tend to be low for
  high for wind turbines  solar pv  very high for  
and     and  
fuel costs - high for fossil fuel and biomass sources  low for nuclear  and zero for many renewables  fuel costs can vary somewhat unpredictably over the life of the generating equipment  due to political and other factors 
factors such as the costs of waste  and associated issues  and different insurance costs are not included in the following  works power  own use or
- that is  the portion of generated power actually used to run the station s pumps and fans has to be allowed for 
to evaluate the total cost of production of electricity  the streams of costs are converted to a
using the   these costs are all brought together using  
levelized cost of electricity  
the levelized cost of electricity  lcoe   also known as levelized energy cost  lec   is the net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a generating asset  it is often taken as a proxy for the average price that the generating asset must receive in a market to break even over its lifetime  it is a first-order economic assessment of the cost competitiveness of an electricity-generating system that incorporates all costs over its lifetime  initial investment  operations and maintenance  cost of fuel   
the levelized cost is that value for which an equal-valued fixed revenue delivered over the life of the asset s generating profile would cause the project to break even  this can be roughly calculated as the net present value of all costs over the lifetime of the asset divided by the total electrical energy output of the asset

note  some caution must be taken when using formulas for the levelized cost  as they often embody unseen assumptions  neglect effects like taxes  and may be specified in real or nominal levelized cost  for example  other versions of the above formula do not discount the electricity stream   
typically the lcoe is calculated over the design lifetime of a plant  which is usually 20 to 40 years  and given in the units of currency per
or megawatt-day  for example aud kwh or eur kwh or per   for example aud mwh  as tabulated below   however  care should be taken in comparing different lcoe studies and the sources of the information as the lcoe for a given energy source is highly dependent on the assumptions  financing terms and technological deployment analyzed  in particular  assumption of
has significant impact on the calculation of lcoe  thus  a key requirement for the analysis is a clear statement of the applicability of the analysis based on justified assumptions 
many scholars    such as   have described limits to the  levelized cost of electricity  metric for comparing new generating sources  in particular  lcoe ignores time effects associated with matching production to demand  this happens at two levels 
dispatchability  the ability of a generating system to come online  go offline  or ramp up or down  quickly as demand swings 
the extent to which the availability profile matches or conflicts with the market demand profile 
thermally lethargic technologies like coal and nuclear are physically incapable of fast ramping  capital intensive technologies such as wind  solar  and nuclear are economically disadvantaged unless generating at maximum availability since the lcoe is nearly all sunk-cost capital investment 
power sources  such as wind and solar  may incur extra costs associated with needing to have storage or backup generation available  at the same time  intermittent sources can be competitive if they are available to produce when demand and prices are highest  such as solar during mid-day peaks seen in summertime load profiles  despite these time limitations  leveling costs is often a necessary prerequisite for making comparisons on an equal footing before demand profiles are considered  and the levelized-cost metric is widely used for comparing technologies at the margin  where grid implications of new generation can be neglected 
another limitation of the lcoe metric is the influence of
and
 eec   eec has caused the electricity demand of many countries to remain flat or decline  considering only the lcoe for utility scale plants will tend to maximise generation and risks overestimating required generation due to efficiency  thus  lowballing  their lcoe  for solar systems installed at the point of end use  it is more economical to invest in eec first  then solar  resulting in a smaller required solar system than what would be needed without the eec measures   however  designing a solar system on the basis of lcoe would cause the smaller system lcoe to increase  as the energy generation  measured in kwh  drops faster than the system cost       the whole of system life cycle cost should be considered  not just the lcoe of the energy source  lcoe is not as relevant to end-users than other financial considerations such as income  cashflow  mortgage  leases  rent  and electricity bills  comparing solar investments in relation to these can make it easier for end-users to make a decision  or using cost-benefit calculations  and or an assets capacity value or contribution to peak on a system or circuit level  
avoided cost  
the us
has recommended that levelized costs of non- sources such as wind or solar may be better compared to the avoided energy cost rather than to the lcoe of dispatchable sources such as fossil fuels or geothermal  this is because introduction of fluctuating power sources may or may not avoid capital and maintenance costs of backup dispatchable sources  levelized avoided cost of energy  lace  is the avoided costs from other sources divided by the annual yearly output of the non-dispatchable source  however  the avoided cost is much harder to calculate accurately 
marginal cost of electricity  
a more accurate economic assessment might be the
of electricity  this value works by comparing the added system cost of increasing electricity generation from one source versus that from other sources of electricity generation  see     
external costs of energy sources  
see also 
and
typically pricing of electricity from various energy sources may not include all
- that is  the costs indirectly borne by society as a whole as a consequence of using that energy source  these may include enabling costs  environmental impacts  usage lifespans  energy storage  recycling costs  or beyond-insurance accident effects 
the us energy information administration predicts that
are set to be continually used to deliver the majority of the world s electricity  this is expected to result in the evacuation of millions of homes in low-lying areas  and an annual cost of hundreds of billions of dollars  worth of property damage 
furthermore  with a number of island nations becoming slowly submerged underwater due to rising sea levels  massive international climate litigation lawsuits against fossil fuel users are currently   beginning in the  
an eu funded research study known as externe  or
of energy  undertaken over the period of 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over its present value  and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30  if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health  from the       river water  
and
emissions produced by these sources  were taken into account  it was estimated in the study that these external  downstream  fossil fuel costs amount up to 1 -2  of the   and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included  coal has the highest external cost in the eu  and global warming is the largest part of that cost 
a means to address a part of the external costs of fossil fuel generation is
 the method most favored by economics for reducing global-warming emissions  carbon pricing charges those who emit carbon dioxide  co2  for their emissions  that charge  called a  carbon price   is the amount that must be paid for the right to emit one tonne of co2 into the atmosphere  carbon pricing usually takes the form of a
or a requirement to purchase permits to emit  also called  allowances   
depending on the assumptions of possible accidents and their probabilites external costs for nuclear power vary significantly and can reach between 0.2 to 200 ct kwh  furthermore  nuclear power is working under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the   the brussels supplementary convention  and the
and in the u s  the   it is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity  but the cost is small  amounting to about 0.1  of the levelized cost of electricity  according to a cbo study 
these beyond-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power  as
plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the
disaster  where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died  or large
in general  as private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios  major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state 
because externalities are diffuse in their effect  external costs can not be measured directly  but must be estimated  one approach estimate external costs of environmental impact of electricity is the methodological convention of federal environment agency of germany  that method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 eurocent kwh  from hard coal 8.94 eurocent kwh  from natural gas 4.91 eurocent kwh  from photovoltaic 1.18 eurocent kwh  from wind 0.26 eurocent kwh and from hydro 0.18 eurocent kwh  for nuclear the federal environment agency indicates no value  as different studies have results that vary by a factor of 1,000  it recommends the nuclear given the huge uncertainty  with the cost of the next inferior energy source to evaluate  based on this recommendation the federal environment agency  and with their own method  the forum ecological-social market economy  arrive at external environmental costs of nuclear energy at 10.7 to 34 ct kwh 
additional cost factors  
calculations often do not include wider system costs associated with each type of plant  such as long distance transmission connections to grids  or balancing and reserve costs  calculations do not include externalities such as health damage by coal plants  nor the effect of co2 emissions on the  
and  
shifts  decommissioning costs of nuclear plants are usually not included  the usa is an exception  because the cost of decommissioning is included in the price of electricity  per the    is therefore not   these types of items can be explicitly added as necessary depending on the purpose of the calculation  it has little relation to actual price of power  but assists policy makers and others to guide discussions and decision making   
these are not minor factors but very significantly affect all responsible power decisions 
show coal  for instance  to be radically higher in terms of ghgs than any alternative  accordingly  in the analysis below 
coal is generally treated as a separate source rather than being averaged in with other coal 
other
include  
and effect of coal extraction on watersheds 
various human health concerns with electricity generation  including
and   now dominate decisions in developed nations that incur health care costs publicly  a
medical school study estimates the us health costs of coal alone at between 300 and 500 billion us dollars annually 
while
varies drastically with distance  the long complex projects required to clear or even upgrade transmission routes make even attractive new supplies often uncompetitive with conservation measures  see below   because the timing of payoff must take the transmission upgrade into account

the first table in this section gives a selection of lcoe from two major government reports from australia  these figures do not include any cost for the
emissions  such as under
or
scenarios  associated with the different technologies 
renewables advocates assert that the cost for wind and solar has dramatically reduced since 2006  for example  the climate council claims over the 5 years between 2009-2014 solar costs fell by 75  making them comparable to coal  and are expected to continue dropping over the next 5 years by another 45  from 2014 prices  however supporting data is unclear  another claim is that wind has been cheaper than coal since 2013  and that coal and gas will become less viable as subsidies are withdrawn and there is the expectation that they will eventually have to pay the costs of pollution 
most energy industry reports will counter that solar and wind cannot replace base load electricity sources due to the intermittent nature of production and that the necessity to maintain unused base load power generation increases the cost of any substantial shift to renewables

the international agency for the energy and
have estimated for 2011 the following costs  for the nuclear power they include the costs due to new safety investments to upgrade the french nuclear plant after the   the cost for those investments is estimated at 4  mwh  concerning the solar power the estimate at 293  mwh is for a large plant capable to produce in the range of 50100 gwh year located in a favorable location  such as in southern europe   for a small household plant capable to produce typically around 3 mwh year the cost is according to the location between 400 and 700  mwh  currently solar power is by far the most expensive renewable source to produce electricity among the technologies studied    although increasing efficiency and longer lifespan of photovoltaic panels together with reduced production costs could make this source of energy more competitive

in november 2015  the investment bank
headquartered in new york  published a study on the current electricity production costs of photovoltaics in the us compared to conventional power generators  the best large-scale photovoltaic power plants can produce electricity at 50 usd per mwh  the upper limit at 60 usd per mwh  in comparison  coal-fired plants are between 65 usd and  150 per mwh  nuclear power at 97 usd per mwh  small photovoltaic power plants on roofs of houses are still at 184-300 usd per mwh  but which can do without electricity transport costs  onshore wind turbines are 32-77 usd per mwh  one drawback is the intermittency of solar and wind power  the study suggests a solution in   but these are still expensive so far

published a report with the title system effects in low carbon energy systems  in this report nea looks at the interactions of dispatchable energy technologies  fossil and nuclear  and variable renewables  solar and wind  in terms of their effects on electricity systems  these grid-level systems costs differ from the levelized cost of electricity metric that scholars like
have criticised as incomplete  as they also include costs related to the electricity grid  such as extending and reinforcing transport and distribution grids  connecting new capacity to the grid  and the additional costs of providing back-up capacity for balancing the grid  nea calculated these costs for a number of oecd countries with different levels of penetration for each energy source  this report has been criticized for its adequacy and used methodology  swedish
in stockholm published a report in response  finding  several question marks concerning the calculation methods   5 while the grid-level systems costs in the 2012 oecd-nea report is calculated to be  17.70 per
for 10  onshore wind in finland  the swedish royal institute of technology concludes in their analysis  that these costs are rather  0 to  3.70 per mwh  or 79  to 100  less than nea s calculations   as they are either much smaller or already included in the market  2324

brookings institution  2014   
in 2014  the
published the net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies which states  after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis  that  the net benefits of new nuclear  hydro  and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants   with the most cost effective
technology being determined to be nuclear power 
comparison different studies  20042009   
several studies compared the levelized cost of nuclear and fossil power generation  these include studies from the royal academy of engineering  uk 2004   university of chicago  us 2004   canadian energy research institute  can 2004   the united kingdom department of trade and industry  uk 2006   the european commission  bel 2008   the house of the lords  select committee on economic affairs  uk 2008  and mit  us 2009  
brazilian electricity mix  the renewable and non-renewable exergetic cost  2014   
as long as exergy stands for the useful energy required for an economic activity to be accomplished  it is reasonable to evaluate the cost of the energy on the basis of its exergy content  besides  as exergy can be considered as measure of the departure of the environmental conditions  it also serves as an indicator of environmental impact  taking into account both the efficiency of supply chain  from primary exergy inputs  and the efficiency of the production processes  in this way 
can be used to rationally distribute the exergy costs and co2 emission cost among the products and by-products of a highly integrated brazilian electricity mix  based on the
methodologies  some authors have shown that exergoeconomy provides an opportunity to quantify the renewable and non-renewable specific exergy consumption  to properly allocate the associated co2 emissions among the streams of a given production route  as well as to determine the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the production processes  accordingly  the non-renewable unit exergy cost  cnr   kj kj  is defined as the rate of non-renewable exergy necessary to produce one unit of exergy rate flow rate of a substance  fuel  electricity  work or heat flow  whereas the total unit exergy cost  ct  includes the renewable  cr  and non-renewable unit exergy costs  analogously  the co2 emission cost  cco2   gco2 kj  is defined as the rate of co2 emitted to obtain one unit of exergy rate flow rate

price history of silicon pv cells since 1977
photovoltaic prices have fallen from  76.67 per watt in 1977 to an estimated  0.30 per watt in 2015  for
  this is seen as evidence supporting   which states that solar cell prices fall 20  for every doubling of cumulative shipments  the famous
calls for a doubling of transistor count every two years 
by 2011  the price of pv modules per mw had fallen by 60  since 2008  according to bloomberg new energy finance estimates  putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in some sunny countries  an alternative and consistent price decline figure of 75  from 2007 to 2012 has also been published  though it is unclear whether these figures are specific to the united states or generally global  the levelised cost of electricity  lcoe  from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions  particularly when the time of generation is included  as electricity is worth more during the day than at night  there has been fierce competition in the supply chain  and further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar lie ahead  posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years  as time progresses  renewable energy technologies generally get cheaper  while fossil fuels generally get more expensive 
the less solar power costs  the more favorably it compares to conventional power  and the more attractive it becomes to utilities and energy users around the globe  utility-scale solar power  could in 2011  be delivered in california at prices well below  100 mwh   0.10 kwh  less than most other peak generators  even those running on low-cost natural gas  lower solar module costs also stimulate demand from consumer markets where the cost of solar compares very favourably to retail electric rates 
in the year 2015 
agreed to supply solar power at 3.87 cents kwh levelised price from its 100 mw playa solar 2 project which is far cheaper than the electricity sale price from conventional electricity generation plants  from january 2015 through may 2016  records have continued to fall quickly  and solar electricity prices  which have reached levels below 3 cents kwh  continue to fall  in august 2016  chile announced a new record low contract price to provide solar power for  29.10 per megawatt-hour  mwh   in september 2016  abu dhabi announced a new record breaking bid price  promising to provide solar power for  24.2 per megawatt-hour  mwh 
it is now evident that  given a carbon price of  50 ton  which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c kwh  solar pv  wind  and nuclear will be cost-competitive in most locations  the declining price of pv has been reflected in rapidly growing installations  totaling about 23 gw in 2011  although some consolidation is likely in 2012  due to support cuts in the large markets of germany and italy  strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade  already  by one estimate  total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation 
in the case of self consumption  payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid  additionally  using pv solar power to charge dc batteries  as used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles  leads to greater efficiencies  but higher costs  traditionally  dc generated electricity from solar pv must be converted to ac for buildings  at an average 10  loss during the conversion  inverter technology is rapidly improving and current equipment have reached over 96  efficiency for small scale residential  while commercial scale three-phase equipment can reach well above 98  efficiency  however  an additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to dc for battery driven devices and vehicles  and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from  2,057.13 to  8,213.64  analysis from 2009  
it is also possible to combine solar pv with other technologies to make hybrid systems  which enable more stand alone systems  the calculation of lcoes becomes more complex  but can be done by aggregating the costs and the energy produced by each component  as for example  pv and
and
while reducing energy- and electricity-related

estimated cost per mwh for
as of 2012
in 2004  wind energy cost a fifth of what it did in the 1980s  and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt
were mass-produced  as of 2012 capital costs for wind turbines are substantially lower than 20082010 but are still above 2002 levels  a 2011 report from the american wind energy association stated   wind s costs have dropped over the past two years  in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour recently     about 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electricity  and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year     winning more mainstream acceptance from wall street s banks     equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years as was the case in previous cycles     5,600 mw of new installed capacity is under construction in the united states  more than double the number at this point in 2010  35  of all new power generation built in the united states since 2005 has come from wind  more than new gas and coal plants combined  as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves  
this cost has additionally reduced as wind turbine technology has improved  there are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades  improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency  also  wind project capital and maintenance costs have continued to decline  for example  the wind industry in the usa in 2014 was able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades  capturing the faster winds at higher elevations  this has opened up new opportunities in indiana  michigan  and ohio  the price of power from wind turbines built 300 to 400ft  91 to 122m  above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal  prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio  saying it is their cheapest option 
in 2016 the norwegian wind energy association  norwea  estimated the lcoe of a typical norwegian wind farm at 44 mwh  assuming a weighted average cost of capital of 8  and an annual 3,500 full load hours  i e  a capacity factor of 40   norwea went on to estimate the lcoe of the 1gw
onshore wind farm which is expected to be operational by 2020 to be as low as 35 mwh to 40 mwh
