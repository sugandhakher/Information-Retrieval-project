etymology
the origins of the roman name   from which the modern name espaa was derived  are uncertain due to inadequate evidence  down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses 
the
scholar
proposed that the word hispania evolved from the
word   meaning  city of the western world  
jess luis cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the
word spy  meaning  to forge metals   therefore  i-spn-ya would mean  the land where metals are forged   it may be a derivation of the phoenician i-shpania  meaning  island of rabbits    land of rabbits  or  edge   a reference to spain s location at the end of the mediterranean  roman coins struck in the region from the reign of
show a female figure with a
at her feet  and
called it the  land of the rabbits  
hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term hesperia  reflecting the
perception of
as a  western land  or  land of the setting sun   hesperia   in   and spain  being still further west  as hesperia ultima 
there is the claim that  hispania  derives from the
word ezpanna meaning  edge  or  border   another reference to the fact that the iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the european continent 
two 15th-century spanish jewish scholars 
and   gave an explanation now considered folkloric  both men wrote in two different published works that the first jews to reach spain were brought by ship by phiros who was confederate with the king of babylon when he laid siege to jerusalem  this man was a
by birth  but who had been given a kingdom in spain  he became related by marriage to espan  the nephew of king heracles  who also ruled over a kingdom in spain  heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native greece  leaving his kingdom to his nephew  espan  from whom the country of espaa  spain  took its name  based upon their testimonies  this eponym would have already been in use in spain by c  350 bce

continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status  the napoleonic invasions of spain led to chaos  triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable  prior to the second world war  spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government  which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy  eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy  spain joined the european union  experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth

the   in its second article  recognises historic entities  a carefully chosen word to avoid the more politically charged  nations  and regions  within the context of the spanish nation  for some people  spain s identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole spanish identity  indeed  some of the regional identities may even conflict with the spanish one  distinct traditional regional identities within spain include the      
and   although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities will claim a distinct historic identity 
it is this last feature of  shared identity  between the more local level or autonomous community and the spanish level which makes the identity question in spain complex and far from univocal 
minority groups
spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies  especially
and   smaller numbers of immigrants from several
countries have recently been settling in spain  there are also sizeable numbers of
immigrants  most of whom are of  
and chinese origin  the single largest group of immigrants are european  represented by large numbers of britons    french and others 
and
have a big population of north african ancestry 
the arrival of the   a   began in the 16th century  estimates of the spanish gitano population range from 750,000 to over one million  there are also the
 also quinquis   a formerly nomadic minority group  their origin is unclear 
historically 
and
are the main minority groups originated in spain and with a contribution to spanish culture  the spanish government is offering spanish nationality to sephardi jews 
immigration
main article 
    where britonswho are the third biggest immigrant community in spainreside in large numbers 
according to the spanish government there were 5.7million foreign residents in spain in 2011  or 12  of the total population  according to residence permit data for 2011  more than 860,000 were   about 770,000 were   approximately 390,000 were british  and 360,000 were   other sizeable foreign communities are           and chinese  there are more than 200,000 migrants from sub-saharan
living in spain  principally
and   since 2000  spain has experienced high
as a result of immigration flows  despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level  this sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants  particularly those arriving illegally by sea  has caused noticeable social tension 
where a large population of
live 
within the eu  spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after   but by a great margin  the highest in absolute numbers  up to 2008  the number of immigrants in spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2million in 2008 out of a total population of 46million  in 2005 alone  a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people  there are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration  including spain s cultural ties with   its geographical position  the porosity of its borders  the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors  which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce 
another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of eu origin typically retiring to spain s mediterranean coast  in fact  spain was europe s largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007  with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5million people arrived  in 2008  prior to the onset of the economic crisis  the financial times reported that spain was the most favoured destination for western europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the eu 
in 2008  the government instituted a  plan of voluntary return  which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the eu to return to their home countries and receive several incentives  including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the spanish social security  the programme had little effect  during its first two months  just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer  what the programme failed to do  the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs  in 2011 alone  more than half a million people left spain  for the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative  and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners
