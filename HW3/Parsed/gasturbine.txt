the basic operation of the gas turbine is similar to that of the

theory of operation  
in an ideal gas turbine  gases undergo three
processes  an
compression  an
 constant pressure  combustion and an isentropic expansion  together  these make up the  
in a real gas turbine  mechanical energy is changed irreversibly  due to internal friction and turbulence  into pressure and thermal energy when the gas is compressed  in either a centrifugal or axial    heat is added in the
and the
of the gas increases  accompanied by a slight loss in pressure  during expansion through the stator and rotor passages in the turbine  irreversible energy transformation once again occurs 
if the engine has a power turbine added to drive an industrial generator or a helicopter rotor  the exit pressure will be as close to the entry pressure as possible with only enough energy left to overcome the pressure losses in the exhaust ducting and expel the exhaust  for a
engine there will be a particular balance between propeller power and jet thrust which gives the most economical operation  in a
only enough pressure and energy is extracted from the flow to drive the compressor and other components  the remaining high pressure gases are accelerated to provide a jet to propel an aircraft 
the smaller the engine  the higher the rotation rate of the shaft s  must be to attain the required blade tip speed  blade-tip speed determines the maximum pressure ratios that can be obtained by the turbine and the compressor  this  in turn  limits the maximum power and efficiency that can be obtained by the engine  in order for tip speed to remain constant  if the diameter of a rotor is reduced by half  the rotational speed must double  for example  large jet engines operate around 10,000 rpm  while micro turbines spin as fast as 500,000 rpm 
mechanically  gas turbines can be considerably less complex than
piston engines  simple turbines might have one main moving part  the compressor shaft turbine rotor assembly  see image above   with other moving parts in the fuel system  however  the precision manufacture required for components and the temperature resistant alloys necessary for high efficiency often make the construction of a simple gas turbine more complicated than a piston engine 
more advanced gas turbines  such as those found in modern   may have 2 or 3 shafts  spools   hundreds of compressor and turbine blades  movable stator blades  and extensive external tubing for fuel  oil and air systems 
and
are a critical part of design  traditionally  they have been   or oil-cooled   these bearings are being surpassed by   which have been successfully used in micro turbines and    
creep  
a major challenge facing turbine design is reducing the
that is induced by the high temperatures  because of the stresses of operation  turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms  as temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency  creep becomes more significant  to limit creep  thermal coatings and
with solid-solution strengthening and
are used in blade designs  protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit   these coatings are often stabilized -based ceramics  using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy  this reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade  oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades  which is especially important in the high-temperature environment  the nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance  the
of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition  a uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase  a combination of nickel  aluminum  and titanium  promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure 
elements such as
and
can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength  the addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase  thus preserving the
resistance  strength  and creep resistance

aeroderivative gas turbines

aeroderivatives are also used in electrical power generation due to their ability to be shut down  and handle load changes more quickly than industrial machines  they are also used in the marine industry to reduce weight  the

are common models of this type of machine   
amateur gas turbines  
increasing numbers of gas turbines are being used or even constructed by amateurs 
in its most straightforward form  these are commercial turbines acquired through military surplus or scrapyard sales  then operated for display as part of the hobby of engine collecting  in its most extreme form  amateurs have even rebuilt engines beyond professional repair and then used them to compete for the  
the simplest form of self-constructed gas turbine employs an automotive
as the core component  a combustion chamber is fabricated and plumbed between the compressor and turbine sections 
more sophisticated turbojets are also built  where their thrust and light weight are sufficient to power large model aircraft  the
design constructs the entire engine from raw materials  including the fabrication of a centrifugal compressor wheel from plywood  epoxy and wrapped carbon fibre strands 
several small companies now manufacture small turbines and parts for the amateur  most turbojet-powered model aircraft are now using these commercial and semi-commercial microturbines  rather than a schreckling-like home-build

industrial gas turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the frames  bearings  and blading are of heavier construction  they are also much more closely integrated with the devices they power often an and the secondary-energy equipment that is used to recover residual energy  largely heat  
they range in size from portable mobile plants to large  complex systems weighing more than a hundred tonnes housed in purpose-built buildings  when the gas turbine is used solely for shaft power  its thermal efficiency is about 30   however  it may be cheaper to buy electricity than to generate it  therefore  many engines are used in chp  combined heat and power  configurations that can be small enough to be integrated into portable
configurations 
gas turbines can be particularly efficient when waste heat from the turbine is recovered by a heat recovery steam generator to power a conventional steam turbine in a
configuration  the 605 mw
9ha achieved a 62.22  efficiency rate with temperatures as high as 1,540c  2,800f   aeroderivative gas turbines can also be used in combined cycles  leading to a higher efficiency  but it will not be as high as a specifically designed industrial gas turbine  they can also be run in a
configuration  the exhaust is used for space or water heating  or drives an
for cooling the inlet air and increase the power output  technology known as  
another significant advantage is their ability to be turned on and off within minutes  supplying power during peak  or unscheduled  demand  since single cycle  gas turbine only  power plants are less efficient than combined cycle plants  they are usually used as   which operate anywhere from several hours per day to a few dozen hours per yeardepending on the electricity demand and the generating capacity of the region  in areas with a shortage of base-load and
capacity or with low fuel costs  a gas turbine powerplant may regularly operate most hours of the day  a large single-cycle gas turbine typically produces 100 to 400megawatts of electric power and has 3540   
industrial gas turbines for mechanical drive  
industrial gas turbines that are used solely for mechanical drive or used in collaboration with a recovery steam generator differ from power generating sets in that they are often smaller and feature a dual shaft design as opposed to single shaft  the power range varies from 1 megawatt up to 50 megawatts    these engines are connected directly or via a gearbox to either a pump or compressor assembly  the majority of installations are used within the oil and gas industries  mechanical drive applications increase efficiency by around 2  
oil and gas platforms require these engines to drive compressors to inject gas into the wells to force oil up via another bore  or to compress the gas for transportation  they re also often used to provide power for the platform  these platforms don t need to use the engine in collaboration with a chp system due to getting the gas at an extremely reduced cost  often free from burn off gas   the same companies use pump sets to drive the fluids to land and across pipelines in various intervals 
compressed air energy storage  
main article 
one modern development seeks to improve efficiency in another way  by separating the compressor and the turbine with a compressed air store  in a conventional turbine  up to half the generated power is used driving the compressor  in a compressed air energy storage configuration  power  perhaps from a wind farm or bought on the open market at a time of low demand and low price  is used to drive the compressor  and the compressed air released to operate the turbine when required 
turboshaft engines  
engines are often used to drive compression trains  for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants  and are used to power almost all modern helicopters  the primary shaft bears the compressor and the high speed turbine  often referred to as the gas generator   while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine  a power turbine or free-wheeling turbine on helicopters  especially  because the gas generator turbine spins separately from the power turbine   in effect the separation of the gas generator  by a fluid coupling  the hot energy-rich combustion gases   from the power turbine is analogous to an

in   various successors have made good progress in the refinement of this mechanism  owing to a configuration that keeps heat away from certain bearings the durability of the machine is improved while the radial turbine is well matched in speed requirement   
scale jet engines  
scale jet engines are scaled down versions of this early full scale engine
also known as miniature gas turbines or micro-jets 
with this in mind the pioneer of modern micro-jets    produced one of the world s first micro-turbines  the fd3/67  this engine can produce up to 22
of thrust  and can be built by most mechanically minded people with basic engineering tools  such as a  
microturbines  
also known as 
turbo alternators
turbogenerator
microturbines are becoming widespread in
and
applications  and are very promising for powering   they range from hand held units producing less than a   to commercial sized systems that produce tens or hundreds of kilowatts  basic principles of microturbine are based on    
part of their claimed success is said to be due to advances in electronics  which allows unattended operation and interfacing with the commercial power grid  electronic power switching technology eliminates the need for the generator to be synchronized with the power grid  this allows the generator to be integrated with the turbine shaft  and to double as the starter motor 
microturbine systems have many claimed advantages over
generators  such as higher   low emissions and few  or just one  moving part  advantages are that microturbines may be designed with
and air-cooling operating without lubricating oil 
or other hazardous materials  nevertheless  reciprocating engines overall are still cheaper when all factors are considered    microturbines also have a further advantage of having the majority of the waste heat contained in the relatively high temperature exhaust making it simpler to capture  whereas the waste heat of reciprocating engines is split between its exhaust and cooling system 
however  reciprocating engine generators are quicker to respond to changes in output power requirement and are usually slightly more efficient  although the efficiency of microturbines is increasing  microturbines also lose more efficiency at low power levels than reciprocating engines 
reciprocating engines typically use simple
   bearings  full-size gas turbines often use ball bearings  the 1000c temperatures and high speeds of microturbines make oil lubrication and ball bearings impractical  they require
or possibly  
when used in extended range electric vehicles the static efficiency drawback is irrelevant  since the gas turbine can be run at or near maximum power  driving an alternator to produce electricity either for the wheel motors  or for the batteries  as appropriate to speed and battery state  the batteries act as a  buffer   energy storage  in delivering the required amount of power to the wheel motors  rendering throttle response of the gas turbine completely irrelevant 
there is  moreover  no need for a significant or variable-speed gearbox  turning an alternator at comparatively high speeds allows for a smaller and lighter alternator than would otherwise be the case  the superior power-to-weight ratio of the gas turbine and its fixed speed gearbox  allows for a much lighter prime mover than those in such hybrids as the toyota prius  which utilised a 1.8 litre petrol engine  or the chevrolet volt  which utilises a 1.4 litre petrol engine   this in turn allows a heavier weight of batteries to be carried  which allows for a longer electric-only range  alternatively  the vehicle can use heavier types of batteries such as lead acid batteries  which are cheaper to buy  or safer types of batteries such as  
when gas turbines are used in extended-range electric vehicles  like those planned   by land-rover range-rover in conjunction with bladon  or by jaguar also in partnership with bladon  the very poor throttling response  their high moment of rotational inertia  does not matter    because the gas turbine  which may be spinning at 100,000 rpm  is not directly  mechanically connected to the wheels  it was this poor throttling response that so bedevilled the 1950 rover gas turbine-powered prototype motor car  which did not have the advantage of an intermediate electric drive train to provide sudden power spikes when demanded by the driver   
gas turbines accept most commercial fuels  such as         and
as well as
such as  
and   however  when running on kerosene or diesel  starting sometimes requires the assistance of a more volatile product such as propane gas - although the new kero-start technology can allow even microturbines fuelled on kerosene to start without propane 
microturbine designs usually consist of a single stage   a single stage
and a   recuperators are difficult to design and manufacture because they operate under high pressure and temperature differentials  exhaust heat can be used for water heating  space heating  drying processes or   which create cold for air conditioning from heat energy instead of electric energy 
typical microturbine efficiencies are 25 to 35   when in a combined heat and power
system  efficiencies of greater than 80    are commonly achieved 
started its millimeter size turbine engine project in the middle of the 1990s when professor of aeronautics and astronautics alan h  epstein considered the possibility of creating a personal turbine which will be able to meet all the demands of a modern person s electrical needs  just as a large turbine can meet the electricity demands of a small city   
problems have occurred with heat dissipation and high-speed bearings in these new microturbines  moreover  their expected efficiency is a very low 5-6   according to professor epstein  current commercial li-ion rechargeable batteries deliver about 120-150 wh kg  mit s millimeter size turbine will deliver 500-700 wh kg in the near term  rising to 1200-1500 wh kg in the longer term 
a similar microturbine built in belgium has a rotor diameter of 20mm and is expected to produce about 1000 w 
external combustion  
most gas turbines are internal combustion engines but it is also possible to manufacture an external combustion gas turbine which is  effectively  a turbine version of a   those systems are usually indicated as efgt  externally fired gas turbine  or ifgt  indirectly fired gas turbine  
external combustion has been used for the purpose of using
or finely ground biomass  such as sawdust  as a fuel  in the indirect system  a
is used and only clean air with no combustion products travels through the power turbine  the
is lower in the indirect type of external combustion  however  the turbine blades are not subjected to combustion products and much lower quality  and therefore cheaper  fuels are able to be used 
when external combustion is used  it is possible to use exhaust air from the turbine as the primary combustion air  this effectively reduces global heat losses  although heat losses associated with the combustion exhaust remain inevitable

gas turbines are often used on         and to a lesser extent  on cars  buses  and motorcycles 
a key advantage of jets and
for aeroplane propulsion - their superior performance at high altitude compared to piston engines  particularly
ones - is irrelevant in most automobile applications  their power-to-weight advantage  though less critical than for aircraft  is still important 
gas turbines offer a high-powered engine in a very small and light package  however  they are not as responsive and efficient as small piston engines over the wide range of rpms and powers needed in vehicle applications  in   as the driving electric motors are mechanically detached from the electricity generating engine  the responsiveness  poor performance at low speed and low efficiency at low output problems are much less important  the turbine can be run at optimum speed for its power output  and batteries and
can supply power as needed  with the engine cycled on and off to run it only at high efficiency  the emergence of the
may also alleviate the responsiveness problem 
turbines have historically been more expensive to produce than piston engines  though this is partly because piston engines have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades  while small gas turbine engines are rarities  however  turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the

passenger road vehicles  cars  bikes  and buses   
a number of experiments have been conducted with gas turbine powered   the largest by   more recently  there has been some interest in the use of turbine engines for hybrid electric cars  for instance  a consortium led by micro gas turbine company
has secured investment from the technology strategy board to develop an ultra lightweight range extender  ulre  for next generation electric vehicles  the objective of the consortium  which includes luxury car maker jaguar land rover and leading electrical machine company sr drives  is to produce the worlds first commercially viable - and environmentally friendly - gas turbine generator designed specifically for automotive applications 
the common turbocharger for gasoline or diesel engines is also a turbine derivative 
concept cars  
the first serious investigation of using a gas turbine in cars was in 1946 when two engineers  robert kafka and robert engerstein of carney associates  a new york engineering firm  came up with the concept where a unique compact turbine engine design would provide power for a rear wheel drive car  after an article appeared in popular science  there was no further work  beyond the paper stage

was installed in the   the second use of a gas turbine in an armoured fighting vehicle was in 1954 when a unit  pu2979  specifically developed for tanks by   was installed and trialled in a british   the

in some tanks and as main powerplants in soviet russian
and u s 
tanks  among others  they are lighter and smaller than
at the same sustained power output but the models installed to date are less fuel efficient than the equivalent diesel  especially at idle  requiring more fuel to achieve the same combat range  successive models of m1 have addressed this problem with battery packs or secondary generators to power the tank s systems while stationary  saving fuel by reducing the need to idle the main turbine  t-80s can mount three large external fuel drums to extend their range  russia has stopped production of the t-80 in favour of the diesel-powered
 based on the    while ukraine has developed the diesel-powered t-80ud and t-84 with nearly the power of the gas-turbine tank  the french
mbt s diesel powerplant features the  hyperbar  hybrid supercharging system  where the engine s turbocharger is completely replaced with a small gas turbine which also works as an assisted diesel exhaust turbocharger  enabling engine rpm-independent boost level control and a higher peak boost pressure to be reached  than with ordinary turbochargers   this system allows a smaller displacement and lighter engine to be used as the tank s powerplant and effectively removes   this special gas turbine turbocharger can also work independently from the main engine as an ordinary apu 
a turbine is theoretically more reliable and easier to maintain than a piston engine  since it has a simpler construction with fewer moving parts but in practice turbine parts experience a higher wear rate due to their higher working speeds  the turbine blades are highly sensitive to dust and fine sand  so that in desert operations air filters have to be fitted and changed several times daily  an improperly fitted filter  or a bullet or shell fragment that punctures the filter  can damage the engine  piston engines  especially if turbocharged  also need well-maintained filters  but they are more resilient if the filter does fail 
like most modern diesel engines used in tanks  gas turbines are usually multi-fuel engines

naval  
the gas turbine from mgb 2009
gas turbines are used in many   where they are valued for their high
and their ships  resulting acceleration and ability to get underway quickly 
the first gas-turbine-powered naval vessel was the  s
mgb 2009  formerly mgb 509  converted in 1947 
fitted their
jet engine with a power turbine  the
grey goose was converted to rolls-royce gas turbines in 1952 and operated as such from 1953  the
bold pioneer and bold pathfinder built in 1953 were the first ships created specifically for gas turbine propulsion 
the first large scale  partially gas-turbine powered ships were the royal navy s
 tribal class 
with
powerplants  the first 
was commissioned in 1961 
the
launched the first
in 1961 with 2
gas turbines in the world s first
propulsion system 
the
had 6 slven-class torpedo boats  the export version of the british   in service from 1965 to 1990  which had 3
 later rr proteus  marine gas turbines rated at 9,510kw  12,750shp  combined  plus two
diesel engines  rated at 340kw  460shp   for better fuel economy at slower speeds  and they also produced 10 willemoes class torpedo   guided missile boats  in service from 1974 to 2000  which had 3
marine proteus gas turbines also rated at 9,510kw  12,750shp   same as the slven-class boats  and 2 general motors diesel engines  rated at 600kw  800shp   also for improved fuel economy at slow speeds 
the
produced 6 spica-class torpedo boats between 1966 and 1967 powered by 3
  each delivering 3,210kw  4,300shp   they were later joined by 12 upgraded norrkping class ships  still with the same engines  with their aft torpedo tubes replaced by antishipping missiles they served as missile boats until the last was retired in 2005 
the
commissioned two
  turunmaa and karjala  in 1968  they were equipped with one 16,410kw  22,000shp 
tm1 gas turbine and three
marine diesels for slower speeds  they were the fastest vessels in the finnish navy  they regularly achieved speeds of 35 knots  and 37.3 knots during sea trials  the turunmaas were paid off in 2002  karjala is today a
in   and turunmaa serves as a floating machine shop and training ship for satakunta polytechnical college 
the next series of major naval vessels were the four canadian
helicopter carrying destroyers first commissioned in 1972  they used 2ft-4 main propulsion engines  2ft-12 cruise engines and 3 solar saturn 750kw generators 
an lm2500 gas turbine on
the first u s  gas-turbine powered ship was the
  a cutter commissioned in 1961 that was powered by two 750kw  1,000shp  turbines utilizing controllable-pitch propellers  the larger
  was the first class of larger cutters to utilize gas turbines  the first of which    was commissioned in 1967  since then  they have powered the
 
and
destroyers  and
    a modified
  is to be the navy s first amphibious assault ship powered by gas turbines  the marine gas turbine operates in a more corrosive atmosphere due to presence of sea salt in air and fuel and use of cheaper fuels 
civilian maritime  
up to the late 1940s much of the progress on marine gas turbines all over the world took place in design offices and engine builder s workshops and development work was led by the british
and other navies  while interest in the gas turbine for marine purposes  both naval and mercantile  continued to increase  the lack of availability of the results of operating experience on early gas turbine projects limited the number of new ventures on seagoing commercial vessels being embarked upon  in 1951  the diesel-electric oil tanker auris  12,290
 dwt  was used to obtain operating experience with a main propulsion gas turbine under service conditions at sea and so became the first ocean-going merchant ship to be powered by a gas turbine  built by
at   uk  in accordance with plans and specifications drawn up by the
and launched on the uk s  s 21st birthday in 1947  the ship was designed with an engine room layout that would allow for the experimental use of heavy fuel in one of its high-speed engines  as well as the future substitution of one of its diesel engines by a gas turbine  the auris operated commercially as a tanker for three-and-a-half years with a diesel-electric propulsion unit as originally commissioned  but in 1951 one of its four 824kw  1,105bhp  diesel engines  which were known as  faith    hope    charity  and  prudence  - was replaced by the worlds first marine gas turbine engine  a 890kw  1,200bhp  open-cycle gas turbo-alternator built by british thomson-houston company in rugby  following successful sea trials off the northumbrian coast  the auris set sail from hebburn-on-tyne in october 1951 bound for
in the us and then
in the southern caribbean returning to
after 44 days at sea  successfully completing her historic trans-atlantic crossing  during this time at sea the gas turbine burnt diesel fuel and operated without an involuntary stop or mechanical difficulty of any kind  she subsequently visited swansea  hull   
and southampton covering a total of 13,211 nautical miles  the auris then had all of its power plants replaced with a 3,910kw  5,250shp  directly coupled gas turbine to become the first civilian ship to operate solely on gas turbine power 
despite the success of this early experimental voyage the gas turbine was not to replace the diesel engine as the propulsion plant for large merchant ships  at constant cruising speeds the diesel engine simply had no peer in the vital area of fuel economy  the gas turbine did have more success in royal navy ships and the other naval fleets of the world where sudden and rapid changes of speed are required by warships in action 
the
were looking for options to update wwii   and heavy-duty gas turbines were one of those selected  in 1956 the john sergeant was lengthened and equipped with a
4,900kw  6,600shp  hd gas turbine with exhaust-gas regeneration  reduction gearing and a   it operated for 9,700 hours using residual fuel   for 7,000 hours  fuel efficiency was on a par with steam propulsion at 0.318kg kw  0.523lb hp  per hour  and power output was higher than expected at 5,603kw  7,514shp  due to the ambient temperature of the north sea route being lower than the design temperature of the gas turbine  this gave the ship a speed capability of 18 knots  up from 11 knots with the original power plant  and well in excess of the 15 knot targeted  the ship made its first transatlantic crossing with an average speed of 16.8 knots  in spite of some rough weather along the way  suitable bunker c fuel was only available at limited ports because the quality of the fuel was of a critical nature  the fuel oil also had to be treated on board to reduce contaminants and this was a labor-intensive process that was not suitable for automation at the time  ultimately  the variable-pitch propeller  which was of a new and untested design  ended the trial  as three consecutive annual inspections revealed stress-cracking  this did not reflect poorly on the marine-propulsion gas-turbine concept though  and the trial was a success overall  the success of this trial opened the way for more development by ge on the use of hd gas turbines for marine use with heavy fuels  the john sergeant was scrapped in 1972 at portsmouth pa 
boeing jetfoil 929-100-007 urzela of
launched its first passenger-carrying -propelled
  in april 1974  those ships were powered by twin
gas turbines of the
series   
between 1971 and 1981 
operated a scheduled
service between ports on the eastern seaboard of the united states and ports in northwest europe across the north atlantic with four container ships of 26,000 tonnes dwt  those ships were powered by twin
gas turbines of the ft 4 series  the four ships in the class were named euroliner  eurofreighter  asialiner and asiafreighter  following the dramatic
 opec  price increases of the mid-1970s  operations were constrained by rising fuel costs  some modification of the engine systems on those ships was undertaken to permit the burning of a lower grade of fuel  i e      reduction of fuel costs was successful using a different untested fuel in a marine gas turbine but maintenance costs increased with the fuel change  after 1981 the ships were sold and refitted with  what at the time  was more economical diesel-fueled engines but the increased engine size reduced cargo space   
the first passenger ferry to use a gas turbine was the   built in 1977 and powered by two
ft 4c-1 dlf turbines  generating 55,000kw  74,000shp  and propelling the ship to a speed of 31knots  however  the finnjet also illustrated the shortcomings of gas turbine propulsion in commercial craft  as high fuel prices made operating her unprofitable  after four years of service additional diesel engines were installed on the ship to reduce running costs during the off-season  the finnjet was also the first ship with a
propulsion  another example of commercial usage of gas turbines in a passenger ship is  s
fastcraft ferries  hss 1500-class stena explorer  stena voyager and stena discovery vessels use
setups of twin
plus ge lm1600 power for a total of 68,000kw  91,000shp   the slightly smaller hss 900-class stena carisma  uses twin    gt35 turbines rated at 34,000kw  46,000shp  gross  the stena discovery was withdrawn from service in 2007  another victim of too high fuel costs   
in july 2000 the
became the first
to be propelled by gas turbines  in a
configuration  the liner
uses a
configuration 
in marine racing applications the 2010 c5000 mystic catamaran
uses two lycoming t-55 turbines for its power system   
advances in technology  
gas turbine technology has steadily advanced since its inception and continues to evolve  development is actively producing both smaller gas turbines and more powerful and efficient engines  aiding in these advances are computer based design  specifically
and   and the development of advanced materials  base materials with superior high temperature strength  e g  
that exhibit   or
that protect the structural material from ever-higher temperatures  these advances allow higher
and turbine inlet temperatures  more efficient combustion and better cooling of engine parts 
computational fluid dynamics  cfd  has contributed to substantial improvements in the performance and efficiency of gas turbine engine components through enhanced understanding of the complex viscous flow and heat transfer phenomena involved  for this reason  cfd is one of the key computational tool used in design   development of gas
turbine engines 
the simple-cycle efficiencies of early gas turbines were practically doubled by incorporating inter-cooling  regeneration  or recuperation   and reheating  these improvements  of course  come at the expense of increased initial and operation costs  and they cannot be justified unless the decrease in fuel costs offsets the increase in other costs  the relatively low fuel prices  the general desire in the industry to minimize installation costs  and the tremendous increase in the simple-cycle efficiency to about 40 percent left little desire for opting for these modifications 
on the emissions side  the challenge is to increase turbine inlet temperatures while at the same time reducing peak flame temperature in order to achieve lower nox emissions and meet the latest emission regulations  in may 2011 
achieved a turbine inlet temperature of 1,600c on a 320 megawatt gas turbine  and 460 mw in gas turbine
power generation applications in which gross
exceeds 60  
compliant
were commercially introduced to gas turbines in the 1990s  these can withstand over a hundred thousand start stop cycles and have eliminated the need for an oil system  the application of microelectronics and
technology have enabled the development of commercially viable electricity generation by micro turbines for distribution and vehicle propulsion 
advantages and disadvantages  
the following are advantages and disadvantages of gas-turbine engines 
advantages  
very high   compared to reciprocating engines
smaller than most reciprocating engines of the same power rating
moves in one direction only  with far less vibration than a reciprocating engine
fewer moving parts than reciprocating engines implies lower maintenance cost 
greater reliability  particularly in applications where sustained high power output is required
waste heat is dissipated almost entirely in the exhaust  this results in a high temperature exhaust stream that is very usable for boiling water in a   or for
low operating pressures
high operation speeds
low lubricating oil cost and consumption
can run on a wide variety of fuels
very low toxic emissions of co and hc due to excess air  complete combustion and no  quench  of the flame on cold surfaces
disadvantages  
cost is very high
less efficient than reciprocating engines at idle speed
longer startup than reciprocating engines
less responsive to changes in power demand compared with reciprocating engines
characteristic whine can be hard to suppress
testing  
british  german  other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test gas turbines  selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer  and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems  in the united states 
has produced several performance test codes on gas turbines  this includes asme ptc 22-2014  these asme performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing gas turbines  the single most important and differentiating characteristic of asme performance test codes  including ptc 22  is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance
