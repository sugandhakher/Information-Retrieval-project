that was accepted as an axiom of     classical or   explains the microscopic origin of the law 
the second law has been expressed in many ways  its first formulation is credited to the french scientist
in 1824  who showed that there is an upper limit to the efficiency of conversion of heat to work in a heat engine

introduction  
the
provides the basic definition of   associated with all   and states the rule of   the second law is concerned with the direction of natural processes  it asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense  and is not reversible  for example  heat always flows spontaneously from hotter to colder bodies  and never the reverse  unless external work is performed on the system  its modern definition is in terms of  
in a fictive reversible process  an infinitesimal increment in the entropy  ds  of a system is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat  q  to a
divided by the common temperature  t  of the system and the surroundings which supply the heat

different notations are used for infinitesimal amounts of heat    and infinitesimal amounts of entropy  d  because entropy is a   while heat  like work  is not  for an actually possible infinitesimal process without exchange of matter with the surroundings  the second law requires that the increment in system entropy be greater than that

this is because a general process for this case may include work being done on the system by its surroundings  which must have frictional or viscous effects inside the system  and because heat transfer actually occurs only irreversibly  driven by a finite temperature difference 
the
in its usual short statement allows recognition that two bodies in a relation of thermal equilibrium have the same temperature  especially that a test body has the same temperature as a reference thermometric body  for a body in thermal equilibrium with another  there are indefinitely many empirical temperature scales  in general respectively depending on the properties of a particular reference thermometric body  the second law allows a distinguished temperature scale  which defines an absolute    independent of the properties of any particular reference thermometric body 
various statements of the law  
the second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in many specific ways  the most prominent classical statements being the statement by
 1854   the statement by
 1851   and the statement in axiomatic thermodynamics by
 1909   these statements cast the law in general physical terms citing the impossibility of certain processes  the clausius and the kelvin statements have been shown to be equivalent 
carnot s principle  
the historical origin of the second law of thermodynamics was in carnot s principle  it refers to a cycle of a   fictively operated in the limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static  so that the heat and work transfers are between subsystems that are always in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium  the carnot engine is an idealized device of special interest to engineers who are concerned with the efficiency of heat engines  carnot s principle was recognized by carnot at a time when the
of heat was seriously considered  before the recognition of the   and before the mathematical expression of the concept of entropy  interpreted in the light of the first law  it is physically equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics  and remains valid today  it states
the efficiency of a quasi-static or reversible carnot cycle depends only on the temperatures of the two heat reservoirs  and is the same  whatever the working substance  a carnot engine operated in this way is the most efficient possible heat engine using those two temperatures 
  
clausius statement  
the german scientist
laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics in 1850 by examining the relation between heat transfer and work  his formulation of the second law  which was published in german in 1854  is known as the clausius statement 
heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change  connected therewith  occurring at the same time 
the statement by clausius uses the concept of  passage of heat   as is usual in thermodynamic discussions  this means  net transfer of energy as heat   and does not refer to contributory transfers one way and the other 
heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold regions to hot regions without external work being performed on the system  which is evident from ordinary experience of refrigeration  for example  in a refrigerator  heat flows from cold to hot  but only when forced by an external agent  the refrigeration system 
kelvin statement  
expressed the second law as
it is impossible  by means of inanimate material agency  to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects 
equivalence of the clausius and the kelvin statements  
derive kelvin statement from clausius statement
suppose there is an engine violating the kelvin statement  i e   one that drains heat and converts it completely into work in a cyclic fashion without any other result  now pair it with a reversed
as shown by the figure  the net and sole effect of this newly created engine consisting of the two engines mentioned is transferring heat

from the cooler reservoir to the hotter one  which violates the clausius statement  thus a violation of the kelvin statement implies a violation of the clausius statement  i e  the clausius statement implies the kelvin statement  we can prove in a similar manner that the kelvin statement implies the clausius statement  and hence the two are equivalent 
planck s proposition  
planck offered the following proposition as derived directly from experience  this is sometimes regarded as his statement of the second law  but he regarded it as a starting point for the derivation of the second law 
it is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a complete cycle  and produce no effect except the raising of a weight and cooling of a heat reservoir 
relation between kelvin s statement and planck s proposition  
it is almost customary in textbooks to speak of the  kelvin-planck statement  of the law  as for example in the text by
and   one text gives a statement very like planck s proposition  but attributes it to kelvin without mention of planck  one monograph quotes planck s proposition as the  kelvin-planck  formulation  the text naming kelvin as its author  though it correctly cites planck in its references  the reader may compare the two statements quoted just above here 
planck s statement  
planck stated the second law as follows 
every process occurring in nature proceeds in the sense in which the sum of the entropies of all bodies taking part in the process is increased  in the limit  i e  for reversible processes  the sum of the entropies remains unchanged 
rather like planck s statement is that of uhlenbeck and ford for irreversible phenomena 
    in an irreversible or spontaneous change from one equilibrium state to another  as for example the equalization of temperature of two bodies a and b  when brought in contact  the entropy always increases 
principle of carathodory  
formulated thermodynamics on a purely mathematical axiomatic foundation  his statement of the second law is known as the principle of carathodory  which may be formulated as follows 
in every neighborhood of any state s of an adiabatically enclosed system there are states inaccessible from s 
with this formulation  he described the concept of
for the first time and provided the foundation for a new subfield of classical thermodynamics  often called   it follows from carathodory s principle that quantity of energy quasi-statically transferred as heat is a holonomic   in other words

  displaystyle  delta q tds 
    
though it is almost customary in textbooks to say that carathodory s principle expresses the second law and to treat it as equivalent to the clausius or to the kelvin-planck statements  such is not the case  to get all the content of the second law  carathodory s principle needs to be supplemented by planck s principle  that isochoric work always increases the internal energy of a closed system that was initially in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium    
planck s principle  
in 1926 
wrote an important paper on the basics of thermodynamics  he indicated the principle
the internal energy of a closed system is increased by an adiabatic process  throughout the duration of which  the volume of the system remains constant 
this formulation does not mention heat and does not mention temperature  nor even entropy  and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts  but it implies the content of the second law  a closely related statement is that  frictional pressure never does positive work   using a now-obsolete form of words  planck himself wrote   the production of heat by friction is irreversible  
not mentioning entropy  this principle of planck is stated in physical terms  it is very closely related to the kelvin statement given just above  it is relevant that for a system at constant volume and   the entropy is a monotonic function of the internal energy  nevertheless  this principle of planck is not actually planck s preferred statement of the second law  which is quoted above  in a previous sub-section of the present section of this present article  and relies on the concept of entropy 
a statement that in a sense is complementary to planck s principle is made by borgnakke and sonntag  they do not offer it as a full statement of the second law 
    there is only one way in which the entropy of a  closed  system can be decreased  and that is to transfer heat from the system 
differing from planck s just foregoing principle  this one is explicitly in terms of entropy change  of course  removal of matter from a system can also decrease its entropy 
statement for a system that has a known expression of its internal energy as a function of its extensive state variables  
the second law has been shown to be equivalent to the
u being a weakly   when written as a function of extensive properties  mass  volume  entropy

perpetual motion of the second kind  
main article 
before the establishment of the second law  many people who were interested in inventing a perpetual motion machine had tried to circumvent the restrictions of
by extracting the massive internal energy of the environment as the power of the machine  such a machine is called a  perpetual motion machine of the second kind   the second law declared the impossibility of such machines 
carnot theorem  
 1824  is a principle that limits the maximum efficiency for any possible engine  the efficiency solely depends on the temperature difference between the hot and cold thermal reservoirs  carnot s theorem states 
all irreversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a
operating between the same reservoirs 
all reversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are equally efficient with a carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs 
in his ideal model  the heat of caloric converted into work could be reinstated by reversing the motion of the cycle  a concept subsequently known as   carnot  however  further postulated that some caloric is lost  not being converted to mechanical work  hence  no real heat engine could realise the  s reversibility and was condemned to be less efficient 
though formulated in terms of caloric  see the obsolete    rather than   this was an early insight into the second law

an important and revealing idealized special case is to consider applying the second law to the scenario of an isolated system  called the total system or universe   made up of two parts  a sub-system of interest  and the sub-system s surroundings  these surroundings are imagined to be so large that they can be considered as an unlimited heat reservoir at temperature tr and pressure pr  so that no matter how much heat is transferred to  or from  the sub-system  the temperature of the surroundings will remain tr  and no matter how much the volume of the sub-system expands  or contracts   the pressure of the surroundings will remain pr 
whatever changes to ds and dsr occur in the entropies of the sub-system and the surroundings individually  according to the second law the entropy stot of the isolated total system must not decrease

where we have first used the definition of entropy in classical thermodynamics  alternatively  in statistical thermodynamics  the relation between entropy change  temperature and absorbed heat can be derived   and then the second law inequality from above 
it therefore follows that any net work w done by the sub-system must obey

it is useful to separate the work w done by the subsystem into the useful work wu that can be done by the sub-system  over and beyond the work pr dv done merely by the sub-system expanding against the surrounding external pressure  giving the following relation for the useful work  exergy  that can be done

this expression together with the associated reference state permits a
working at the macroscopic scale  above the   to utilize the second law without directly measuring or considering entropy change in a total isolated system   also  see    those changes have already been considered by the assumption that the system under consideration can reach equilibrium with the reference state without altering the reference state  an efficiency for a process or collection of processes that compares it to the reversible ideal may also be found  see   
this approach to the second law is widely utilized in
practice      and other disciplines

the first theory of the conversion of heat into mechanical work is due to
in 1824  he was the first to realize correctly that the efficiency of this conversion depends on the difference of temperature between an engine and its environment 
recognizing the significance of  s work on the conservation of energy 
was the first to formulate the second law during 1850  in this form  heat does not flow spontaneously from cold to hot bodies  while common knowledge now  this was contrary to the
of heat popular at the time  which considered heat as a fluid  from there he was able to infer the principle of sadi carnot and the definition of entropy  1865  
established during the 19th century  the
says   it is impossible for any device that operates on a
to receive heat from a single
and produce a net amount of work   this was shown to be equivalent to the statement of clausius 
the
is also important for the
approach  it says that  over long periods of time  the time spent in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region  i e  that all accessible microstates are equally probable over a long period of time  equivalently  it says that time average and average over the statistical ensemble are the same 
there is a traditional doctrine  starting with clausius  that entropy can be understood in terms of molecular  disorder  within a   this doctrine is obsolescent

stated what he called the  second fundamental theorem in the   in the following form

where q is heat  t is temperature and n is the  equivalence-value  of all uncompensated transformations involved in a cyclical process  later  in 1865  clausius would come to define  equivalence-value  as entropy  on the heels of this definition  that same year  the most famous version of the second law was read in a presentation at the philosophical society of zurich on april 24  in which  in the end of his presentation  clausius concludes 
the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum 
this statement is the best-known phrasing of the second law  because of the looseness of its language  e g    as well as lack of specific conditions  e g  open  closed  or isolated  many people take this simple statement to mean that the second law of thermodynamics applies virtually to every subject imaginable  this  of course  is not true  this statement is only a simplified version of a more extended and precise description

of the system and because of the constant motion  the system is constantly changing its microstate  statistical mechanics postulates that  in equilibrium  each microstate that the system might be in is equally likely to occur  and when this assumption is made  it leads directly to the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical sense  that is  the second law will hold on average  with a statistical variation on the order of 1 n where n is the number of particles in the system  for everyday  macroscopic  situations  the probability that the second law will be violated is practically zero  however  for systems with a small number of particles  thermodynamic parameters  including the entropy  may show significant statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law  classical thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical variations 
derivation from statistical mechanics  
further information 
due to   derivations of the second law have to make an assumption regarding the past  namely that the system is
at some time in the past  this allows for simple probabilistic treatment  this assumption is usually thought as a   and thus the second law is ultimately a consequence of the initial conditions somewhere in the past  probably at the beginning of the universe  the    though
have also been suggested 
given these assumptions  in statistical mechanics  the second law is not a postulate  rather it is a consequence of the   also known as the equal prior probability postulate  so long as one is clear that simple probability arguments are applied only to the future  while for the past there are auxiliary sources of information which tell us that it was low entropy    the first part of the second law  which states that the entropy of a thermally isolated system can only increase  is a trivial consequence of the equal prior probability postulate  if we restrict the notion of the entropy to systems in thermal equilibrium  the entropy of an isolated system in thermal equilibrium containing an amount of energy of

e

  here

e
  displaystyle  delta e 
is a macroscopically small energy interval that is kept fixed  strictly speaking this means that the entropy depends on the choice of

e
  displaystyle  delta e 
  however  in the thermodynamic limit  i e  in the limit of infinitely large system size   the specific entropy  entropy per unit volume or per unit mass  does not depend on

e
  displaystyle  delta e 
 
suppose we have an isolated system whose macroscopic state is specified by a number of variables  these macroscopic variables can  e g   refer to the total volume  the positions of pistons in the system  etc  then

  displaystyle  omega  
will depend on the values of these variables  if a variable is not fixed   e g  we do not clamp a piston in a certain position   then because all the accessible states are equally likely in equilibrium  the free variable in equilibrium will be such that

  displaystyle  omega  
is maximized as that is the most probable situation in equilibrium 
if the variable was initially fixed to some value then upon release and when the new equilibrium has been reached  the fact the variable will adjust itself so that

  displaystyle  omega  
is maximized  implies that the entropy will have increased or it will have stayed the same  if the value at which the variable was fixed happened to be the equilibrium value   suppose we start from an equilibrium situation and we suddenly remove a constraint on a variable  then right after we do this  there are a number

  displaystyle  omega  
of accessible microstates  but equilibrium has not yet been reached  so the actual probabilities of the system being in some accessible state are not yet equal to the prior probability of
1
 

  displaystyle 1  omega  
  we have already seen that in the final equilibrium state  the entropy will have increased or have stayed the same relative to the previous equilibrium state  boltzmann s   however  proves that the quantity h increases monotonically as a function of time during the intermediate out of equilibrium state

for the justification for this definition  suppose that the system has some external parameter  x  that can be changed  in general  the energy eigenstates of the system will depend on x  according to the
of quantum mechanics  in the limit of an infinitely slow change of the system s hamiltonian  the system will stay in the same energy eigenstate and thus change its energy according to the change in energy of the energy eigenstate it is in 
the generalized force  x  corresponding to the external variable x is defined such that

since the system can be in any energy eigenstate within an interval of

we can relate this to the derivative of the entropy with respect to x at constant energy e as follows  suppose we change x to x   dx  then

 
e
 
  displaystyle  omega  left e right  
will change because the energy eigenstates depend on x  causing energy eigenstates to move into or out of the range between

  since these energy eigenstates increase in energy by y dx  all such energy eigenstates that are in the interval ranging from e  y dx to e move from below e to above e  there are

  all these energy eigenstates will move into the range between

  the number of energy eigenstates that move from below

is thus the net contribution to the increase in

  displaystyle  omega  
  note that if y dx is larger than

e
  displaystyle  delta e 
there will be the energy eigenstates that move from below e to above
e

  displaystyle n  y  left e right  
and
n
y
 
e
 

e
 
  displaystyle n  y  left e  delta e right  
  therefore the above expression is also valid in that case 
expressing the above expression as a derivative with respect to e and summing over y yields the expression

the first term is intensive  i e  it does not scale with system size  in contrast  the last term scales as the inverse system size and will thus vanishes in the thermodynamic limit  we have thus found that

living organisms  
there are two principal ways of formulating thermodynamics   a  through passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another  and  b  through cyclic processes  by which the system is left unchanged  while the total entropy of the surroundings is increased  these two ways help to understand the processes of life  this topic is mostly beyond the scope of this present article  but has been considered by several authors  such as  
and   it is also the topic of current research 
to a fair approximation  living organisms may be considered as examples of  b   approximately  an animal s physical state cycles by the day  leaving the animal nearly unchanged  animals take in food  water  and oxygen  and  as a result of   give out breakdown products and heat  plants
from the sun  which may be regarded as heat  and carbon dioxide and water  they give out oxygen  in this way they grow  eventually they die  and their remains rot  this can be regarded as a cyclic process  overall  the sunlight is from a high temperature source  the sun  and its energy is passed to a lower temperature sink  the soil  this is an increase of entropy of the surroundings of the plant  thus animals and plants obey the second law of thermodynamics  considered in terms of cyclic processes  simple concepts of efficiency of heat engines are hardly applicable to this problem because they assume closed systems 
from the thermodynamic viewpoint that considers  a   passages from one equilibrium state to another  only a roughly approximate picture appears  because living organisms are never in states of thermodynamic equilibrium  living organisms must often be considered as open systems  because they take in nutrients and give out waste products  thermodynamics of open systems is currently often considered in terms of passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another  or in terms of flows in the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium  the problem for living organisms may be further simplified by the approximation of assuming a steady state with unchanging flows  general principles of entropy production for such approximations are subject to   nevertheless  ideas derived from this viewpoint on the second law of thermodynamics are enlightening about living creatures 
gravitational systems  
in systems that do not require for their descriptions the general theory of relativity  bodies always have positive   meaning that the temperature rises with energy  therefore  when energy flows from a high-temperature object to a low-temperature object  the source temperature is decreased while the sink temperature is increased  hence temperature differences tend to diminish over time  this is not always the case for systems in which the gravitational force is important and the general theory of relativity is required  such systems can spontaneously change towards uneven spread of mass and energy  this applies to the universe in large scale  and consequently it may be difficult or impossible to apply the second law to it  beyond this  the thermodynamics of systems described by the general theory of relativity is beyond the scope of the present article 
non-equilibrium states  
main article 
the theory of classical or equilibrium thermodynamics is idealized  a main postulate or assumption  often not even explicitly stated  is the existence of systems in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium  in general  a region of space containing a physical system at a given time  that may be found in nature  is not in thermodynamic equilibrium  read in the most stringent terms  in looser terms  nothing in the entire universe is or has ever been truly in exact thermodynamic equilibrium 
for purposes of physical analysis  it is often enough convenient to make an assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium  such an assumption may rely on trial and error for its justification  if the assumption is justified  it can often be very valuable and useful because it makes available the theory of thermodynamics  elements of the equilibrium assumption are that a system is observed to be unchanging over an indefinitely long time  and that there are so many particles in a system  that its particulate nature can be entirely ignored  under such an equilibrium assumption  in general  there are no macroscopically detectable   there is an exception  the case of   which exhibit to the naked eye the phenomenon of   for laboratory studies of critical states  exceptionally long observation times are needed 
in all cases  the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium  once made  implies as a consequence that no putative candidate  fluctuation  alters the entropy of the system 
it can easily happen that a physical system exhibits internal macroscopic changes that are fast enough to invalidate the assumption of the constancy of the entropy  or that a physical system has so few particles that the particulate nature is manifest in observable fluctuations  then the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium is to be abandoned  there is no unqualified general definition of entropy for non-equilibrium states 
there are intermediate cases  in which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is a very good approximation  but strictly speaking it is still an approximation  not theoretically ideal  for non-equilibrium situations in general  it may be useful to consider statistical mechanical definitions of other quantities that may be conveniently called  entropy   but they should not be confused or conflated with thermodynamic entropy properly defined for the second law  these other quantities indeed belong to statistical mechanics  not to thermodynamics  the primary realm of the second law 
the physics of macroscopically observable fluctuations is beyond the scope of this article

irreversibility  
irreversibility in
is a consequence of the asymmetric character of thermodynamic operations  and not of any internally irreversible microscopic properties of the bodies  thermodynamic operations are macroscopic external interventions imposed on the participating bodies  not derived from their internal properties  there are reputed  paradoxes  that arise from failure to recognize this 
loschmidt s paradox  
main article 
  also known as the reversibility paradox  is the objection that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from the time-symmetric dynamics that describe the microscopic evolution of a macroscopic system 
in the opinion of    it is now quite obvious in what manner you have to reformulate the law of entropyor for that matter  all other irreversible statementsso that they be capable of being derived from reversible models  you must not speak of one isolated system but at least of two  which you may for the moment consider isolated from the rest of the world  but not always from each other   the two systems are isolated from each other by the wall  until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation  as envisaged by the law  the thermodynamic operation is externally imposed  not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems  it is the cause of the irreversibility  the statement of the law in this present article complies with schrdinger s advice  the causeeffect relation is logically prior to the second law  not derived from it 
poincar recurrence theorem  
main article 
the
considers a theoretical microscopic description of an isolated physical system  this may be considered as a model of a thermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation has removed an internal wall  the system will  after a sufficiently long time  return to a microscopically defined state very close to the initial one  the poincar recurrence time is the length of time elapsed until the return  it is exceedingly long  likely longer than the life of the universe  and depends sensitively on the geometry of the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation  the recurrence theorem may be perceived as apparently contradicting the second law of thermodynamics  more obviously  however  it is simply a microscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system formed by removal of a wall between two systems  for a typical thermodynamical system  the recurrence time is so large  many many times longer than the lifetime of the universe  that  for all practical purposes  one cannot observe the recurrence  one might wish  nevertheless  to imagine that one could wait for the poincar recurrence  and then re-insert the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation  it is then evident that the appearance of irreversibility is due to the utter unpredictability of the poincar recurrence given only that the initial state was one of thermodynamic equilibrium  as is the case in macroscopic thermodynamics  even if one could wait for it  one has no practical possibility of picking the right instant at which to re-insert the wall  the poincar recurrence theorem provides a solution to loschmidt s paradox  if an isolated thermodynamic system could be monitored over increasingly many multiples of the average poincar recurrence time  the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under time reversal 
james clerk maxwell
maxwell s demon  
main article 
imagined one container divided into two parts  a and b  both parts are filled with the same
at equal temperatures and placed next to each other  separated by a wall  observing the
on both sides  an imaginary
guards a microscopic trapdoor in the wall  when a faster-than-average molecule from a flies towards the trapdoor  the demon opens it  and the molecule will fly from a to b  the average
of the molecules in b will have increased while in a they will have slowed down on average  since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature  the temperature decreases in a and increases in b  contrary to the second law of thermodynamics 
one response to this question was suggested in 1929 by
and later by   szilrd pointed out that a real-life maxwell s demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed  and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy 
maxwell s demon repeatedly alters the permeability of the wall between a and b  it is therefore performing
on a microscopic scale  not just observing ordinary spontaneous or natural macroscopic thermodynamic processes
