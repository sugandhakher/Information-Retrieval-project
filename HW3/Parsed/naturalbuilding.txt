a natural building involves a range of
systems and materials that place major emphasis on   ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed  plentiful or   as well as those that  while
or salvaged  produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality  natural building tends to rely on human labor  more than technology  as michael g  smith observes  it depends on  local ecology  geology and climate  on the character of the particular building site  and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users  
the basis of natural building is the need to lessen the
impact of buildings and other supporting systems  without sacrificing comfort or health  to be more sustainable  natural building uses primarily abundantly available  renewable  reused or recycled materials  the use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus  in addition to relying on natural building materials  the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened  the orientation of a building  the utilization of local climate and site conditions  the emphasis on natural ventilation through design  fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environmental  building compactly and minimizing the

materials  
the materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand  when mixed with water and  usually  straw or another fiber  the mixture may form
or
 clay blocks   other materials commonly used in natural building are  earth  as
or    wood   or  post-and-beam     rice-hulls 
and   a wide variety of reused or
non-toxic materials are common in natural building  including urbanite  salvaged chunks of used concrete   vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass 
other materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach  due to their major negative environmental or health impacts  these include unsustainably harvested wood  toxic wood-preservatives  -based mixes  paints and other coatings that off-gas
 vocs   and some plastics  particularly
 pvc or  vinyl   and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations   
techniques  
many traditional techniques and materials are now experiencing a resurgence of popularity  this differs around the world based on climate appropriate building design and the availability of local materials 
adobe  
main articles 
and
one of the oldest building methods  adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water  often  chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength  the mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape  usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls 
various claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand  or larger aggregate   some say that the best adobe soil contains 15  - 30  clay to bind the material together  others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks  the blocks can either be poured into molds and dried  or pressed into blocks  adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor 
to protect the walls and reduce maintenance  adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations  adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection  adobe has good thermal mass  meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold  it is not a good insulator  however  so insulation can be added  preferably on the outside   or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between  the traditional thick  un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods   
cob

a small cob building with a
the term cob is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay  sand  straw and earth  the construction uses no forms  bricks or wooden framework  it is built from the ground up  various forms of  mud  building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries  under a variety of names  and date from at least 10,000 years ago  cob building began use in england prior to the 13th century  and fell out of favor after world war i  although it is seeing a resurgence today  cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available  though it is typically very labor-intensive  cob s other great advantage is versatility  it can easily be shaped into any form  while cob building was falling out of favor in england by the late 19th century  thousands of cob structures have endured to the present  20,000 in   england alone   it is estimated that from one third to one half of the world s population lives in earthen dwellings today  although typically associated with  low-rise  structures  in
and other middle-eastern countries it has  for centuries  been used in  apartment  buildings of eight stories and more 
cob-like mixes are also used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building  such as adobe  earth bags  timber frames  cordwood  and straw bales  earth is thus a primary ingredient of natural building   
cordwood  
main article 
a section of a cordwood home 
cordwood construction is a term used for a natural building method in which  cordwood  or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with
or
mixtures to build a wall  the cordwood  thus  becomes infill for the walls  usually between posts in a
structure  cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods  e g     cob or   to produce attractive combinations  cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high   which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature 
earthbag  
main articles 
and
earth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques  this building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber  burlap  bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer such as portland cement  to form footings  foundations  walls and even vaulted or domed roofs  in recent years  building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building  it facilitates self-contained  often free-form rammed-earth structures  its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material  earth  in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible  and easy to learn and use  however  because earth is a poor insulator  in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored  substituting pumice  rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth  see also

rammed earth  
main article 
rammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth  or another material that is compacted  it is extremely strong and durable  quality rammed earth walls are dense  solid  and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics    as an option depending on climate or seismic concerns rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall as well as steel reinforcement  rammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces 
rammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil  containing sand  clay and sometimes gravel  into movable  reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers  in traditional rammed earth  a mixture of around 70  aggregate  gravel sand  and 30  clay is optimal  pigmentation may be added if the mix to achieve the desired color  around 5-10inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved  what is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years 
stone  
dry limestone bridge across hubb creek  wellington  ontario  canada  it was built by members of  dry stone walling across canada  using 38 tons of stone
stone has been used as a building material for thousands of years  it has long been recognized as a material of great durability  the pyramids in giza  burial chambers in the uk and temples in malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing  the earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone  or dry stacking  these are freestanding structures such as field walls  bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping  structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases  they do not require any special tools  only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones 
traditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking  stone blocks are laid in rows of even  courses  or uneven  un-coursed  height  and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones  traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry  cut and transport  and the building process is labor and skill-intensive 
stone is a highly durable  low maintenance building material with high thermal mass  it is versatile  available in many shapes  sizes  colors and textures  and can be used for floors  walls  arches and roofs  stone blends well with the   and can easily be recycled for other building purposes 
straw bale  
main article 
straw bale construction in santa cruz  ca
although
and
have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world  their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular
seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern united states  particularly the sand-hills of   where grass was plentiful and other building materials  even quality   were not  straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales  often in running-bond  on a raised footing or   with a moisture barrier between  bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood  internal to the bales or on their faces   or with surface wire meshes  and then
or
either lime-based formulations or earth clay renders  bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials  with bales between  simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate   referred to as  infill  or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof  referred to as    or  nebraska-style   or a combination of
and load-bearing may be employed  referred to a  hybrid  straw bale   
typically  bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used   field-bales    but recently higher-density  recompressed  bales  or  straw-blocks   are increasing the loads that may be supported  where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall  the high density bales bear up to 4,000lb  lin ft  and more  and the basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other often-recycled materials  including tire-bales  as well as those of cardboard  paper  plastics and used carpeting  and to bag-contained  bales  of wood-chips  rice-hulls  etc   
timber frame  
main article 
the completed frame of a modern timber frame home
the basic elements of timber frame buildingjoined timbers  clay walls and
were in place in europe and asia by the 9th century  it remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century  craftsmanship was  and is  an important value in timber frame building  the oldest timber frame structures  for example  the timber framed stave churches of   show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design  as do such structures in    
timber framing typically uses a     a bent is a structural support  like a   consisting of two posts  a tie beam and two rafters  these are connected into a framework through joinery  to practice the craft  one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent  this  along with a knowledge of   are the basis of timber frame building   
timber framing is now a modern method of construction  ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings  in conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern   it is possible to quickly construct a high performance  sustainable building  using completely natural products  the benefits are manythe building performs better over its lifespan  waste is reduced  much can be re-cycled  composted or used as fuel   timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques  such as cob  straw bale  or cordwood masonry
