cut-away view of an air -supported turbocharger
a turbocharger  or colloquially turbo  is a -driven
device that increases an internal combustion engine s efficiency and power output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber  this improvement over a  s power output is due to the fact that the compressor can force more airand proportionately more fuelinto the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure  and for that matter  ram air intakes  alone 
turbochargers were originally known as turbosuperchargers when all
devices were classified as superchargers  nowadays the term    is usually applied only to mechanically driven forced induction devices  the key difference between a turbocharger and a conventional
is that a supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine  often through a belt connected to the   whereas a turbocharger is powered by a turbine driven by the engine s   compared to a mechanically driven supercharger  turbochargers tend to be more efficient  but less responsive 
refers to an engine with both a supercharger and a turbocharger 
turbochargers are commonly used on truck  car  train  aircraft  and construction equipment engines  they are most often used with
and
  they have also been found useful in automotive

history  
dates from the late 19th century  when
patented the technique of using a gear-driven
to force air into an internal combustion engine in 1885  the turbocharger was invented by swiss engineer
 18791959   the head of diesel engine research at
 now called sulzer   engine manufacturing company in   who received a patent in 1905 for using a compressor driven by exhaust gases to force air into an internal combustion engine to increase power output  but it took another 20 years for the idea to come to fruition  during world war i french engineer
fitted turbochargers to renault engines powering various french fighters with some success  in 1918 
engineer
attached a turbocharger to a
aircraft engine  the engine was tested at
in
at 14,000ft  4,300m  to demonstrate that it could eliminate the power loss usually experienced in internal combustion engines as a result of reduced air pressure and density at high altitude  general electric called the system turbosupercharging  at the time  all
devices were known as superchargers  however  more recently the term  supercharger  is usually applied to only mechanically driven forced induction devices 
turbochargers were first used in production aircraft engines such as the
in the 1920s  although they were less common than engine-driven centrifugal superchargers  ships and locomotives equipped with turbocharged
began appearing in the 1920s  turbochargers were also used in aviation  most widely used by the united states  during world war ii  notable examples of u s  aircraft with turbochargers include the       and   the technology was also used in experimental fittings by a number of other manufacturers  notably a variety of
models  but the need for advanced high-temperature metals in the turbine kept them out of widespread use   
turbochargers are widely used in car and commercial vehicles because they allow smaller-capacity engines to have improved fuel economy  reduced emissions  higher power and considerably higher torque 
turbocharging versus supercharging  
main article 
in contrast to turbochargers  superchargers are mechanically driven by the engine  belts  chains  shafts  and gears are common methods of powering a supercharger  placing a mechanical load on the engine  for example  on the single-stage single-speed supercharged
engine  the supercharger uses about 150 horsepower  110 kilowatts   yet the benefits outweigh the costs  for the 150hp  110kw  to drive the supercharger the engine generates an additional 400-horsepower  a net gain of 250hp  190kw   this is where the principal disadvantage of a supercharger becomes apparent  the engine must withstand the net power output of the engine plus the power to drive the supercharger 
another disadvantage of some superchargers is lower
efficiency as compared to turbochargers  especially    adiabatic efficiency is a measure of a compressor s ability to compress air without adding excess heat to that air  even under ideal conditions  the compression process always results in elevated output temperature  however  more efficient compressors produce less excess heat  roots superchargers impart significantly more heat to the air than turbochargers  thus  for a given volume and pressure of air  the turbocharged air is cooler  and as a result denser  containing more oxygen molecules  and therefore more potential power than the supercharged air  in practical application the disparity between the two can be dramatic  with turbochargers often producing 15  to 30  more power based solely on the differences in adiabatic efficiency  however  due to heat transfer from the hot exhaust  considerable heating does occur  
by comparison  a turbocharger does not place a direct mechanical load on the engine  although turbochargers place exhaust back pressure on engines  increasing pumping losses  this is more efficient  because while the increased back pressure taxes the piston exhaust stroke  much of the energy driving the turbine is provided by the still-expanding exhaust gas that would otherwise be wasted as heat through the tailpipe  in contrast to supercharging  the primary disadvantage of turbocharging is what is referred to as  lag  or  spool time   this is the time between the demand for an increase in power  the throttle being opened  and the turbocharger s  providing increased intake pressure  and hence increased power 
throttle lag occurs because turbochargers rely on the buildup of exhaust gas pressure to drive the turbine  in variable output systems such as automobile engines  exhaust gas pressure at idle  low engine speeds  or low throttle is usually insufficient to drive the turbine  only when the engine reaches sufficient speed does the turbine section start to spool up  or spin fast enough to produce intake pressure above atmospheric pressure 
a combination of an exhaust-driven turbocharger and an engine-driven supercharger can mitigate the weaknesses of both  this technique is called  
in the case of  s two-stroke engines  the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger  as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup  once above notch   5  the engine uses true turbocharging  this differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and  as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally aspirate  and  according to sae definitions  a two-stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated 
operating principle  
in normally aspirated   intake gases are  pushed  into the engine by atmospheric pressure filling the volumetric void caused by the downward stroke of the piston  which creates a low-pressure area   similar to drawing liquid using a syringe  the amount of air actually inspired  compared to the theoretical amount if the engine could maintain atmospheric pressure  is called   the objective of a turbocharger is to improve an engine s volumetric efficiency by increasing density of the intake gas  usually air  allowing more power per engine cycle 
the turbocharger s compressor draws in ambient air and compresses it before it enters into the
at increased pressure  this results in a greater mass of air entering the cylinders on each intake stroke  the power needed to spin the
is derived from the kinetic energy of the engine s exhaust gases 
a turbocharger may also be used to increase fuel efficiency without increasing power  this is achieved by recovering waste energy in the exhaust and feeding it back into the engine intake  by using this otherwise wasted energy to increase the mass of air  it becomes easier to ensure that all fuel is burned before being vented at the start of the exhaust stage  the increased temperature from the higher pressure gives a higher
efficiency 
the control of turbochargers has changed dramatically over the 100-plus years of its use  modern turbochargers can use   blow-off valves and variable geometry  as discussed in later sections 
the reduced density of intake air is often compounded by the loss of atmospheric density seen with elevated altitudes  thus  a natural use of the turbocharger is with   as an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes  the pressure of the surrounding air quickly falls off  at 18,000 feet  5,500m   the air is at half the pressure of sea level  which means that the engine produces less than half-power at this altitude

in automotive applications  boost refers to the amount by which intake manifold pressure exceeds   this is representative of the extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction  the level of boost may be shown on a pressure gauge  usually in bar  psi or possibly kpa 
in aircraft engines  turbocharging is commonly used to maintain manifold pressure as
increases  i e  to compensate for lower-density air at higher altitudes   since atmospheric pressure reduces as the aircraft climbs  power drops as a function of altitude in normally aspirated engines  systems that use a turbocharger to maintain an engine s sea-level power output are called turbo-normalized systems  generally  a turbo-normalized system attempts to maintain a manifold pressure of 29.5 inches of mercury  100kpa  
in petrol engine turbocharger applications  boost pressure is limited to keep the entire engine system  including the turbocharger  inside its thermal and mechanical design   over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine in a variety of ways including pre-ignition  overheating  and over-stressing the engine s internal hardware 
for example  to avoid
 also known as detonation  and the related physical damage to the engine  the intake manifold pressure must not get too high  thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means  opening the
allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe  thus reducing boost pressure  the wastegate can be either controlled manually  frequently seen in aircraft  or by an actuator  in automotive applications  it is often controlled by the   
turbocharger lag  
  
turbocharger lag  turbo lag  is the time required to change power output in response to a throttle change  noticed as a hesitation or slowed
when accelerating as compared to a naturally aspirated engine  this is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and turbocharger to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as spooling  inertia  friction  and compressor load are the primary contributors to turbocharger lag  superchargers do not suffer this problem  because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine 
turbocharger applications can be categorized into those that require changes in output power  such as automotive  and those that do not  such as marine  aircraft  commercial automotive  industrial  engine-generators  and locomotives   while important to varying degrees  turbocharger lag is most problematic in applications that require rapid changes in power output  engine designs reduce lag in a number of ways

boost threshold  
the boost threshold of a turbocharger system is the lower bound of the region within which the compressor operates  below a certain rate of flow  a compressor produces insignificant boost  this limits boost at a particular rpm  regardless of exhaust gas pressure  newer turbocharger and engine developments have steadily reduced boost thresholds 
electrical boosting   e-boosting   is a new technology under development  it uses an electric motor to bring the turbocharger up to operating speed quicker than possible using available exhaust gases  an alternative to e-boosting is to completely separate the turbine and compressor into a turbine-generator and electric-compressor as in the   this makes compressor speed independent of turbine speed  in 1981  a similar system that used a hydraulic drive system and overspeed clutch arrangement accelerated the turbocharger of the mv canadian pioneer  doxford 76j4cr engine    
turbochargers start producing boost only when a certain amount of kinetic energy is present in the exhaust gasses  without adequate exhaust gas flow to spin the turbine blades  the turbocharger cannot produce the necessary force needed to compress the air going into the engine  the boost threshold is determined by the engine displacement  engine rpm  throttle opening  and the size of the turbocharger  the operating speed    at which there is enough exhaust gas momentum to compress the air going into the engine is called the  boost threshold rpm   reducing the  boost threshold rpm  can improve throttle response 
key components  
the turbocharger has three main components 
the turbine  which is almost always a
 but is almost always a single-stage
in large diesel engines 
the compressor  which is almost always a
the center housing hub rotating assembly
many turbocharger installations use   such as wastegates  intercooling and blow-off valves 
turbine  
energy provided for the turbine work is converted from the enthalpy and kinetic energy of the gas  the turbine housings direct the gas flow through the turbine as it spins at up to 250,000 rpm  the size and shape can dictate some performance characteristics of the overall turbocharger  often the same basic turbocharger assembly is available from the manufacturer with multiple housing choices for the turbine  and sometimes the compressor cover as well  this lets the balance between performance  response  and efficiency be tailored to the application 
the turbine and impeller wheel sizes also dictate the amount of air or exhaust that can flow through the system  and the relative efficiency at which they operate  in general  the larger the turbine wheel and compressor wheel the larger the flow capacity  measurements and shapes can vary  as well as curvature and number of blades on the wheels

a turbochargers performance is closely tied to its size  large turbochargers take more heat and pressure to spin the turbine  creating lag at low speed  small turbochargers spin quickly  but may not have the same performance at high acceleration  to efficiently combine the benefits of large and small wheels  advanced schemes are used such as twin-turbochargers  twin-scroll turbochargers  or variable-geometry turbochargers 
twin-turbo  
main article 
twin-turbo or bi-turbo designs have two separate turbochargers operating in either a sequence or in parallel  in a parallel configuration  both turbochargers are fed one-half of the engines exhaust  in a sequential setup one turbocharger runs at low speeds and the second turns on at a predetermined engine speed or load  sequential turbochargers further reduce turbo lag  but require an intricate set of pipes to properly feed both turbochargers 
two-stage variable twin-turbos employ a small turbocharger at low speeds and a large one at higher speeds  they are connected in a series so that boost pressure from one turbocharger is multiplied by another  hence the name  2-stage   the distribution of exhaust gas is continuously variable  so the transition from using the small turbocharger to the large one can be done incrementally  twin turbochargers are primarily used in diesel engines  for example  in   only the smaller turbocharger works at low speed  providing high torque at 1,5001,700rpm  both turbochargers operate together in mid range  with the larger one pre-compressing the air  which the smaller one further compresses  a bypass valve regulates the exhaust flow to each turbocharger  at higher speed  2,500 to 3,000 rpm  only the larger turbocharger runs 
smaller turbochargers have less turbo lag than larger ones  so often two small turbochargers are used instead of one large one  this configuration is popular in engines over 2,500 ccs and in v-shape or boxer engines 
twin-scroll  
twin-scroll or divided turbochargers have two exhaust gas inlets and two nozzles  a smaller sharper angled one for quick response and a larger less angled one for peak performance 
with high-performance camshaft timing  exhaust valves in different cylinders can be open at the same time  overlapping at the end of the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another  in twin-scroll designs  the
physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other  so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals  scrolls   with common
1-3-4-2  two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2  this lets the engine efficiently use exhaust
techniques  which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and nox emissions  improves turbine efficiency  and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds

variable-geometry  
main article 
variable-geometry or variable-nozzle turbochargers use moveable vanes to adjust the air-flow to the turbine  imitating a turbocharger of the optimal size throughout the power curve  the vanes are placed just in front of the turbine like a set of slightly overlapping walls  their angle is adjusted by an actuator to block or increase air flow to the turbine  this variability maintains a comparable exhaust velocity and back pressure throughout the engines rev range  the result is that the turbocharger improves fuel efficiency without a noticeable level of turbocharger lag

any   please help improve this section by   unsourced material may be challenged and    july 2013    
the flow range of a turbocharger compressor can be increased by allowing air to bleed from a ring of holes or a circular groove around the compressor at a point slightly downstream of the compressor inlet  but far nearer to the inlet than to the outlet  
the ported shroud is a performance enhancement that allows the compressor to operate at significantly lower flows  it achieves this by forcing a simulation of impeller stall to occur continuously  allowing some air to escape at this location inhibits the onset of surge and widens the operating range  while peak efficiencies may decrease  high efficiency may be achieved over a greater range of engine speeds  increases in compressor efficiency result in slightly cooler  more dense  intake air  which improves power  this is a passive structure that is constantly open  in contrast to compressor exhaust blow off valves  which are mechanically or electronically controlled   the ability of the compressor to provide high boost at low rpm may also be increased marginally  because near choke conditions the compressor draws air inward through the bleed path   ported shrouds are used by many turbocharger manufacturers 
center housing hub rotating assembly  
the center hub rotating assembly  chra  houses the shaft that connects the compressor impeller and turbine  it also must contain a bearing system to suspend the shaft  allowing it to rotate at very high speed with minimal friction  for instance  in automotive applications the chra typically uses a thrust bearing or ball bearing lubricated by a constant supply of pressurized engine oil  the chra may also be considered  water-cooled  by having an entry and exit point for engine coolant  water-cooled models use engine coolant to keep lubricating oil cooler  avoiding possible oil
 destructive distillation of engine oil  from the extreme heat in the turbine  the development of air- removed this risk 
designed to support high speeds and temperatures are sometimes used instead of fluid bearings to support the turbine shaft  this helps the turbocharger accelerate more quickly and reduces turbo lag  some variable nozzle turbochargers use a rotary electric   which uses a direct stepper motor to open and close the vanes  rather than pneumatic controllers that operate based on air pressure 
additional technologies commonly used in turbocharger installations  
intercooling  
illustration of inter-cooler location 
when the pressure of the engine s intake air is increased  its temperature also increases  in addition  heat soak from the hot exhaust gases spinning the turbine will also heat the intake air  the warmer the intake air  the less dense  and the less oxygen available for the combustion event  which reduces volumetric efficiency  not only does excessive intake-air temperature reduce efficiency  it also leads to engine knock  or   which is destructive to engines 
turbocharger units often make use of an
 also known as a    to cool down the intake air  intercoolers are often   tested for leaks during routine servicing  particularly in trucks where a leaking intercooler can result in a 20  reduction in fuel economy   
 note that intercooler is the proper term for the air cooler between successive stages of boost  whereas charge air cooler is the proper term for the air cooler between the boost stage s  and the appliance that consumes the boosted air  
water injection  
main article 
an alternative to intercooling is injecting water into the intake air to reduce the temperature  this method has been used in automotive and aircraft applications   
fuel-air mixture ratio  
main article 
in addition to the use of intercoolers  it is common practice to add extra fuel to the intake air  known as  running an engine rich   for the sole purpose of cooling  the amount of extra fuel varies  but typically reduces the air-fuel ratio to between 11 and 13  instead of the
14.7  in petrol engines   the extra fuel is not burned  as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction   instead it undergoes a phase change from atomized  liquid  to gas  this phase change absorbs heat  and the added mass of the extra fuel reduces the average thermal energy of the charge and exhaust gas  even when a
is used  the practice of running an engine rich increases exhaust emissions 
wastegate  
main article 
a wastegate regulates the exhaust gas flow that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and therefore the air intake into the manifold and the degree of boosting  it can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted  generally vacuum hose attachment point diaphragm  for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system  to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the overboost point is sensed by the ecu or a
operated by the engines
or a   but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose attachment point spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be pushed open  thus limiting overboost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the wastegate   
anti-surge dump blow off valves  
main article 
a recirculating type anti-surge valve
turbocharged engines operating at wide open throttle and high rpm require a large volume of air to flow between the turbocharger and the inlet of the engine  when the throttle is closed  compressed air flows to the throttle valve without an exit  i e   the air has nowhere to go  
in this situation  the surge can raise the pressure of the air to a level that can cause damage  this is because if the pressure rises high enough  a
occursstored pressurized air decompresses backward across the impeller and out the inlet  the reverse flow back across the turbocharger makes the turbine shaft reduce in speed more quickly than it would naturally  possibly damaging the turbocharger 
to prevent this from happening  a valve is fitted between the turbocharger and inlet  which vents off the excess air pressure  these are known as an anti-surge  diverter  bypass  turbo-relief valve  blow-off valve  bov   or   it is a   and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold 
the primary use of this valve is to maintain the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed  the air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet  diverter or bypass valves   but can also be vented to the atmosphere  blow off valve   recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system  because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixturebecause the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air that is no longer being used  valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration  since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere 
free floating  
a free floating turbocharger is used in the 100 litre engine of this caterpillar mining vehicle 
a free floating turbocharger is the simplest type of turbocharger  this configuration has no wastegate and cant control its own boost levels  they are typically designed to attain maximum boost at full throttle  free floating turbochargers produce more horsepower because they have less backpressure  but are not driveable in performance applications without an external wastegate

aircraft  
a natural use of the turbocharger and its earliest known use for any internal combustion engine  starting with experimental installations in the 1920s is with   as an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes the pressure of the surrounding air quickly falls off  at 5,486
 18,000ft   the air is at half the pressure of sea level and the airframe experiences only half the   however  since the charge in the cylinders is pushed in by this air pressure  the engine normally produces only half-power at full throttle at this altitude  pilots would like to take advantage of the low drag at high altitudes to go faster  but a naturally aspirated engine does not produce enough power at the same altitude to do so 
the table below is used to demonstrate the wide range of conditions experienced  as seen in the table below  there is significant scope for
to compensate for lower density environments

a turbocharger remedies this problem by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures  or even much higher  in order to produce rated power at high altitude  since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude  the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude  the speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate  early systems used a fixed wastegate  resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger  later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate  controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system  when the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open  venting all the exhaust gases overboard  as the aircraft climbs and the air density drops  the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power  the altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude  when the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude  engine power output decreases as altitude increases  just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine 
with older supercharged aircraft  the pilot must continually adjust the throttle to maintain the required manifold pressure during ascent or descent  the pilot must also take care to avoid over-boosting the engine and causing damage  in contrast  modern turbocharger systems use an automatic wastegate  which controls the manifold pressure within parameters preset by the manufacturer  for these systems  as long as the control system is working properly and the pilot s control commands are smooth and deliberate  a turbocharger cannot over-boost the engine and damage it 
yet the majority of world war ii engines used superchargers  because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers  which were larger  involved extra piping  and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system  the size of the piping alone is a serious issue  american fighters
and
used the same engine  but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was  in part  needed to hold the piping to and from the turbocharger in the rear of the plane  turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines  pilots must make smooth  slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target   the fuel air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings  in systems using a manually operated wastegate  the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger s maximum rpm  the additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine s size  weight  complexity and cost  a turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine  the great majority of world war ii american
used by the   particularly the
cyclone-9 powered   and
powered
four-engine bombers both used similar models of -designed turbochargers in service  as did the twin -engined
american
during the war years 
it must be noted that all of the above wwii aircraft engines had mechanically driven superchargers  and the turbosuperchargers  with   were added to achieve desired altitude performance 
today  most
piston engine powered aircraft are naturally aspirated    modern aviation piston engines designed to run at high altitudes typically include a turbocharger  either high pressure or turbonormalized  rather than a supercharger    the change in thinking is largely due to economics 
was once plentiful and cheap  favoring the simple  but fuel-hungry supercharger  as the cost of fuel has increased  the supercharger has fallen out of favor 
turbocharged aircraft often occupy a performance range between that of normally aspirated piston-powered aircraft and turbine-powered aircraft  despite the negative points  turbocharged aircraft fly higher for greater efficiency  high cruise flight also allows more time to evaluate issues before a forced landing must be made 
as the turbocharged aircraft climbs  however  the pilot  or automated system  can close the wastegate  forcing more exhaust gas through the turbocharger turbine  thereby maintaining manifold pressure during the climb  at least until the critical pressure altitude is reached  when the wastegate is fully closed   after which manifold pressure falls  with such systems  modern high-performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25,000 feet  above which  rvsm certification would be required   where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airspeeds  this allows flying  above the weather   in manually controlled wastegate systems  the pilot must take care not to overboost the engine  which causes detonation  leading to engine damage

turbocharging can dramatically improve an engine s
and   performance characteristics that are normally poor in non-turbocharged diesel engines 
diesel engines have no
because diesel fuel is injected at or towards the end of the compression stroke and is ignited solely by the heat of compression of the charge air  because of this  diesel engines can use a much higher boost pressure than spark ignition engines  limited only by the engine s ability to withstand the additional heat and pressure

series engines  the turbocharger is initially driven by the engine s crankshaft through a gear train and an   thereby providing aspiration for combustion  after combustion has been achieved  and after the exhaust gases have reached sufficient heat energy  the overrunning clutch is automatically disengaged  and the turbo-compressor is thereafter driven exclusively by the exhaust gases  in the emd application  the turbocharger acts as a compressor for normal aspiration during starting and low power output settings and is used for true turbocharging during medium and high power output settings  this is particularly beneficial at high altitudes  as are often encountered on western u s  railroads  it is possible for the turbocharger to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power 
business and adoption  
 now honeywell  
and
are the largest manufacturers in europe and the united states  several factors are expected to contribute to more widespread consumer adoption of turbochargers  especially in the us 
new government fuel economy and emissions targets 
increasing oil prices and a consumer focus on fuel efficiency 
only 10 percent of light vehicles sold in the united states are equipped with turbochargers  making the united states an emerging market  compared to 50 percent of vehicles in europe that are turbocharged diesel and 27 percent that are gasoline boosted 
higher temperature tolerances for gasoline engines  ball bearings in the turbine shaft and variable geometry have reduced driveability concerns 
by 2016  40 percent of light vehicles sold in the u s  are expected to be turbocharged  in
about 65 percent of vehicles are turbocharged  which is expected to grow to 85 percent by 2015  historically  more than 90 percent of turbochargers were diesel  however  adoption in gasoline engines is increasing 
predicts the number of turbochargers in passenger vehicles in the u s  to more than double to 23 percent by 2016 
the u s  coalition for advanced diesel cars is pushing for a technology neutral policy for government subsidies of environmentally friendly automotive technology  if successful  government subsidies would be based on the
 cafe  standards rather than supporting specific technologies like electric cars  political shifts could drastically change adoption projections  turbocharger sales in the united states increased when the federal government boosted corporate average fuel economy targets to 35.5 mpg by 2016 
safety  
turbocharger failures and resultant high exhaust temperatures are among the recognized causes of car fires
