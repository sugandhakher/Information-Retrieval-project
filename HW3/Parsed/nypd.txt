history  
main article 
mounted police squad on parade circa 1910
the municipal police were established in 1845  replacing an old
system  in 1857  it was tumultuously replaced by a metropolitan force  which consolidated many other local police departments in 1898  twentieth-century trends included professionalization and struggles against corruption 
rank structure  
this section discusses ranks of the nypd as a whole  the   traffic control division 
and
have their own rank and grade structures despite being part of the nypd and commanded by officers of the nypd proper command structure 
officers begin service with the rank of probationary police officer  also referred to as recruit officer  after successful completion of six months of police academy training and various academic  physical  and tactical tests  officers graduate from the police academy  while officially retaining the title of probationary police officer  graduates are referred to as a police officer  or informally as a  rookie   until they have completed an additional 18 months probationary period 
there are three career  tracks  in the nypd  supervisory  investigative  and specialist  the supervisory track consists of 12 sworn titles  referred to as ranks  promotion to the ranks of sergeant  lieutenant and
are made via competitive
examinations  promotion to the ranks of deputy inspector  inspector  deputy chief  assistant chief and chief are made at the discretion of the police commissioner  after successfully passing a series of civil service exams  promotion from the rank of police officer to
is determined by the current police labor contract  with the approval of the commissioner  the entry level appointment to detective is third grade or specialist  the commissioner may grant discretionary grades of first or second  these grades offer compensation roughly equivalent to that of supervisors  specifically  a second grade detective s pay roughly corresponds to a sergeant s and a first grade detective s pay roughly corresponds to a lieutenant s  detectives are police officers who have been given a more investigatory position but no official supervisory authority  a detective first grade still falls under the command of a sergeant or above  just like detectives  sergeants and lieutenants can receive pay grade increases within their respective ranks

there are two basic types of   detective-investigators and detective-specialists 
detective-investigators are the type most people associate with the term  detective  and are the ones most frequently portrayed on television and in the movies  most police officers gain their detective title by working in the narcotics division of the
and are then moved to the   detectives assigned to squads are co-located within each precinct and are responsible for investigating      
and other crimes within that precinct s boundaries  other detective-investigators are assigned to specialized units at either the major command or citywide level  investigating               major
or
committed against banks or museums    contractor fraud and other complex  politically sensitive or high-profile cases  a squad of detective-investigators is also assigned to each of the city s five
offices   arsons are investigated by the arson and explosion squad as well as   who are part of the   
promotion from police officer to detective-investigator is based on investigative experience  typically  a police officer who is assigned to investigative work for 18 months will be designated  detective-investigator  and receive the gold shield and pay increase commensurate with that designation  in the recent past  however  there has been controversy over the budget-conscious department compelling police officers to work past the 18 months without receiving the new title 
newly appointed detectives start at detective third grade  which has a pay rate roughly between that of police officer and sergeant  as they gain seniority and experience  they can be  promoted  to detective second-grade  which has a pay grade slightly less than sergeants  detective first-grade is an elite designation for the department s most senior and experienced investigators and carries a pay grade slightly less than lieutenants  all these promotions are discretionary on the part of the commissioner and can be revoked if warranted  and while senior detectives can give directions to junior detectives in their own squads  not even the most senior detective can lawfully issue orders to even a junior patrol officer  all detective grades still fall under the  chain of command  of the supervisory ranks beginning with sergeant through chief of department  detectives  like police officers  are eligible to take the promotional civil service exams for entry into the supervisory ranks

while carrying with them increased pay and prestige  none of these detective grades confer on the holder any supervisory authority  contrary to some media portrayals  there is no specific rank of  detective sergeant  or  detective lieutenant   lieutenants and sergeants are assigned to oversee detective squads as supervisors  and are responsible for all investigations 
there is a small percentage of lieutenants and sergeants who work as investigative supervisors  approximately equal to 10  of their respective ranks  and are granted the prestigious pay grade designations of  sergeantsupervisor detective squad   sds   or lieutenantcommander detective squad  cds  therefore assuming full investigative command responsibility as opposed to operational supervision  their pay grade rises to an approximate midpoint between their normal rank and the next highest rank s pay grade  and similar to a detective s  grade   is also a discretionary promotion  this pay grade designation is achieved by assignment to investigative units  i e    internal affairs bureau  counter-terrorism bureau  intelligence bureau  and   lieutenants and sergeants in non-investigatory assignments can be designated lieutenant-special assignment or sergeant-special assignment  pay equivalent to their investigative counterparts 
 detective-specialists  are a relatively new designation and one unique to the nypd  in the 1980s  many detectives resented that some officers were being granted the rank of detective in order to give them increased pay and status  but were not being assigned to investigative duties  examples included officers assigned as bodyguards and drivers to the mayor  police commissioner and other senior officials 
to remedy this situation  the rank of detective-specialist was created  these officers are typically found in specialized units because they possess a unique or esoteric skill the department needs  e g   crime-scene tech  sharpshooter  bomb technician  scuba instructor  helicopter instructor  sketch artist  etc  like detective-investigators  detective-specialists start at third-grade and can be promoted to second- or first-grade status 
a nypd motorcycle police officer speaks with a passerby in 2008 
the department is administered and governed by the   who is appointed by the   technically  the commissioner serves a five-year term  as a practical matter  the commissioner serves at the mayor s pleasure  the commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners  the commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law  however  a police commissioner who comes up from the uniformed ranks retains that status while serving as police commissioner  this has ramifications for their police pensions and the fact that any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm  and does retain the statutory powers of a police officer  some police commissioners  like ray kelly  do carry a personal firearm  but they also have a full-time security detail from the police commissioner s  detective  squad 
a first deputy police commissioner may have a security detail when he she acts as commissioner or under other circumstances as approved by the police commissioner

deputy commissioner
these individuals are administrators who supersede the chief of department  and they usually specialize in areas of great importance to the department  such as counterterrorism  operations  training  public information  legal matters  intelligence  and information technology  despite their role  as civilian administrators of the department  deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation  the commissioner and the first deputy commissioner may take control of these situations  however  
within the rank structure  there are also designations  known as  grades   that connote differences in duties  experience  and pay  however  supervisory functions are generally reserved for the rank of sergeant and above 
in the new york city police department are referred to as  shields   the traditional term   though not all badge designs are strictly   every rank has a different badge design  with the exception of police officer and probationary police officer   and upon change in rank officers receive a new badge  lower-ranked police officers are identified by their shield numbers  and tax registry number  lieutenants and above do not have shield numbers and are identified by tax registry number  all sworn members of the nypd have their id card photos taken against a red background  civilian employees of the nypd have their id card photos taken against a blue background  signifying that they are not commissioned to carry a firearm  all id cards have an expiration date
