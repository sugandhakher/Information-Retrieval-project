accounts for an average of 90  of the energy output for the entire nation  as of 2014  99  of its electrical energy was derived from
sources  about 80  of which from hydroelectric power  as a country  costa rica has a geographic advantage over others in that its high concentration per capita of rivers  dams  and volcanoes allow for a high renewable energy output  in addition  costa rica is the fourth highest nation in terms of rainfall per capita  it receives an average of 2,926mm of precipitation per year  as a smaller nation with a population of only 5 million and no major industry  the need for strong energy infrastructure is less than for larger countries of higher population density  the 1948 elimination of the
also allows that the government does not need to spend millions of dollars on the defense budget and instead invests in social programs and renewable energy generation  as president of costa rica in 1948 
announced that the nation s former military budget would be refocused specifically in healthcare  education  and environmental protection 
while costa rica s largest source of energy is   other sources include       and

sources  
hydroelectricity  
costa rica receives about 80  of its energy from hydroelectric plants alone due to its extreme amounts of rainfall and multiple rivers  as the largest source of energy 
alone can generate nearly enough energy to power the whole country 
dams
costa ricas largest dams include the
dam 
dam  the rio macho dam  the birris dam  and the proposed   the lake arenal dam was built in 1979 as the first dam intended solely for hydroelectric power usage  it is located on lake arenal next to the famous   one of the major tourist attractions in costa rica  at about 33 square miles wide  it provides enough electricity to power 12  of the entire country  the lake cachi  rio macho  and birris dams are all powered by the rio reventazon    and its tributaries  the cachi dam is situated on an artificial lake that was built in the 1970 s and produces enough energy to power about 330,000 homes in costa rica  it also controls floods and provides recreational activities in the lake  upstream of cachi  the rio macho hydroelectric power plant has been operating since 1963 to provide hydroelectric power for central costa rica  on the downstream  the birris dam is one of the largest dams in costa rica and has the potential to power 160,000 homes  it also employes 3,000 costa ricans and provides drinking water to 40  of the metropolitan city area  the  el disqus hydroelectric project  is a proposed hydroelectric system that costa rica plans to build by 2018 as the largest central american hydroelectric plant  this plant will also be located on the reventazn river and will provide the nation with 631mw  enough energy to reach at least one million consumers 
geothermal power  
geothermal power is a natural energy source that provides subterranean heat and power as a byproduct of volcanic energy  costa rica has six currently active volcanoes and dozens of inactive volcanoes  unlike many other forms of renewable energy  geothermal can be continuously generated and is not dependent on weather  geothermal energy contributes to about 15 percent of the energy in the country 
plants
the north volcanic mountain ridge in
is the region of costa rica with the most potential for geothermal power generation  volcanoes in the region include miravalles  rincn de la vieja  and tenorio 
the miravalles geothermal field  opened in 1994  contains five plants and results in the production of 14  of the national electric system s power capacity  or about 163 mw  the pailas geothermal power plant  established in july 2011  produces a total of 55mw and is located just outside rincn de la vieja national park 
is a 600,000 year old volcano and the largest in the northwestern region of costa rica  in 2014  costa rica s government approved legislation for a  958 million geothermal project in the region to offset the country s reliance on hydropower 
wind power  
while costa rica is not known specifically for its wind power  there have been a few different wind energy projects developed in the past decade  in march 2015  the costa rican institute of electricity stated that they plan on doubling the installed wind capacity in the nation by 2017  as of 2011  only 2.1  of energy produced in the nation came from wind power 
wind power is primarily used in costa rica during the months of december to march  or the dry season  during this period  there is a general decreased rainfall in the nation and hydropower output decreases 
farms
currently  there are nine large wind farms operating in costa rica  the tejona wind power project  twpp  is a 19.8 mw project  fully operational since 2003  that consists of thirty wind turbines  most recently  tila wind  an even larger 20-mw farm  opened in 2015  three of the remaining eight are owned by ice and compania nacional de fuerza y luz sa  cnfl  and coopesantos rl  the remaining five are privately owned  and nearly all of the wind power plants are in the province of guanacaste 
solar power  
like wind power 
is another newer energy source in the country  costa rica s proximity to the equator and high frequency of sunny days provides high solar power potential  the first solar power projects in the country were established in 1978 by just a few researchers from public universities at the solar power laboratory at the national university  though still on a smaller scale and mostly privately owned  plans for larger more commercial projects are beginning to break through 
biomass  
as of 2011  only  25  of energy produced in costa rica came from biomass  the jorge manuel dengo obregon national development plan proposes the development of sustainable biomass for energy  currently  biomass is primarily used for cooking and heating kitchen appliances to reduce the reliance on petroleum in the household 
energy organizations  
ice  
although the first large-scale hydroelectric station began to function at the beginning of the 1900s  large-scale hydroelectric power and electricity did not begin to be developed until the formation of
 costa rica electricity institute  in 1949  the costa rica electricity institute  ice  is one of the largest companies in costa rica  this company has had a monopoly over all of the electricity generation in the nation since its birth  ice owns nearly all of the large dams in the nation and generates most of the costa ricans hydroelectric power 
acope  
asociacin costarricense de productores de energa  acope  was founded in 1989 and represents more than 40 private hydroelectric  wind  and biomass units generating in the country  though there are a few large private energy companies in costa rica  most primarily generate power to sell to ice 
consorcio nacional de empresas de electrificacion de costa rica  
consorcio nacional de empresas de electrificacion de costa rica  conelectricas   formed in 1989  is a union that aims to develop hydroelectric projects  the union consists of four smaller agencies  coopeguanacaste  r l  coope alfaro ruiz  r l  coopelesca  r l  and coopesantos  r l  together  these four cooperatives provide electricity to around 500,000 people  or 22  of the country 
2015  75 days of renewable energy  
at the start of january 2015  costa ricas 4.9 million person population ran entirely on renewable energy power for 75 days straight  this was a record-breaking achievement in that costa rica was the first nation to power itself completely clean of fossil fuels for this long a timeframe  this summer was an exceptionally rainy one for costa rica  while usually the dry season  the sheer amount of power provided from an unusually high amount of precipitation led to a higher than usual amount of hydroelectricity generated 
carbon neutrality  
costa rica aims to be 100 
by 2021  apart from relying 99  on renewable resources  carbon neutrality is achieved by adopting electric and hybrid transportation  in addition  the costa rican government is also beginning to offset the country s
with new budgeting  laws  and incentives  including measures to promote   hybrid vehicles  and clean energy  another way of offsetting emissions will be a  c-neutral  tax which will certify that ecotourism and other industrial practices are offsetting their carbon emissions  at  10 per one ton of carbon  the money will fund conservation  reforestation  and research 
legislation  
as of november 2015  the office of governing citizen action party legislator is working on a bill allowing geothermal electricity development in national parks  in turn  the ice would compensate land used for the projects with land outside the parks  the bill addresses concerns over geothermal electricity generation in rincn de la vieja  tenorio  and arenal volcano national parks 
conflicts  
transportation  
see also 
the biggest obstacle to carbon neutrality is the transportation sector  vehicles consume 70  of the petroleum consumed in the nation  which is 40  of the total carbon emissions  the primary mode of public transportation are diesel-powered buses  more than 50  of costa rica s personal passenger cars are over 20 years old with high polluting engines  though the government is beginning to propose new hybrid and
initiatives  other proposed solutions include trains  gondolas  and trolleys in the metropolitan  
reliability  
though hydroelectricity from dams is a high-density and high-power energy source  it is also highly dependent on weather conditions  hydropower is reliant on rainfall and is therefore not the most reliable form of energy during seasons of drought  after an extreme season of drought in 2014  costa rica was forced to resort to diesel generators since sufficient rainfall was unavailable to power any of the hydroelectric dams 
wind and solar are both energy sources that are highly dependent on weather conditions and have therefore been used on a much smaller scale than both hydroelectric and geothermal energy 
environmental and social impact  
one main barrier to extensive geothermal power is the abundance of national parks and protected areas that prevent excavation near many of costa ricans volcanoes  for example  though rincon de la vieja has the potential to fuel a high density of geothermal energy  costa rican law currently prohibits the extraction of resources inside national parks in order to preserve the land  hydroelectric dams have also been criticized for their effects on the surrounding ecosystems  controversy around hydroelectric dam usage stems from both environmental impact on a surrounding region and from human displacement of land  hydroelectric dams have been equated to interference in fish migration patterns  ecosystem disrupt  interference in water quality  and land degradation from flooding the land 
the birris dam especially caused much controversy regarding the displacement of people who lived in the area  especially in relation to the   though dams provide job opportunities for locals  they also displace large populations of humans
