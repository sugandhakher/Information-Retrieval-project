2015  warmest global year on record  since 1880   colours indicate temperature anomalies     20 january 2016  
earth has been in radiative imbalance since at least the 1970s  where less energy leaves the
than enters it  most of this extra energy has been absorbed by the oceans  it is very likely that human activities substantially contributed to this increase in  
two millennia of mean surface temperatures according to different reconstructions from   each smoothed on a decadal scale  with the

trends
temperature changes vary over the globe  since 1979  land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures  70022733999999999990.25cper decade against 70022732799999999990.13cper decade   ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective
of the oceans and because the ocean loses more heat by evaporation  since the
the temperature difference between the
has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the north  average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world in the past 100 years  however arctic temperatures are also highly variable  although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the northern than southern hemisphere this does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to mix between hemispheres 
the
of the oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects mean that climate can take centuries or longer to adjust to changes in forcing  one
study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000 levels  surface temperatures would still increase by about one-half degree celsius  and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005 levels surface warming could exceed a whole degree celsius  some of this surface warming will be driven by past natural forcings which are still seeking   one study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64  of the committed 2050 surface warming and their influence will fade with time compared to the human contribution 
global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends and can temporarily mask them  the relative stability in surface temperature from 2002 to 2009  which has been dubbed the
by the media and some scientists  is consistent with such an episode  2015 updates to account for differing methods of measuring ocean surface temperature measurements show a positive trend over the recent decade 
warmest years
fifteen of the top 16 warmest years have occurred since 2000  while record-breaking years can attract considerable public interest  individual years are less significant than the overall trend  some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to  warmest year  statistics  for example 
stated  the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not   ocean oscillations such as the
 enso  can affect global average temperatures  causing temperatures of a given year to be abnormally warm or cold for reasons not directly related to the overall trend of climate change  for example  1998 and 2015 temperatures were significantly enhanced by strong el nio conditions

human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  leading to increased radiative forcing from co2  methane   
and   according to work published in 2007  the
of co2 and methane have increased by 36  and 148  respectively since 1750  these levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years  the period for which reliable data has been extracted from   less direct geological evidence indicates that co2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago 
burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in co2 from human activity over the past 20 years  the rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use    another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic co2 emissions is the

  estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases  have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic      and natural developments  in most scenarios  emissions continue to rise over the century  while in a few  emissions are reduced  fossil fuel reserves are abundant  and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century  emission scenarios  combined with modelling of the   have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future  using the six ipcc
 marker  scenarios  models suggest that by the year 2100  the atmospheric concentration of co2 could range between 541 and 970 ppm  this is 90250  above the concentration in the year 1750 
the popular media and the public often confuse global warming with   i e   the destruction of
by   although there are a few   the relationship between the two is not strong  reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures  while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect 
aerosols and soot
can be seen as lines in these clouds over the atlantic ocean on the east coast of the united states  atmospheric particles from these and other sources could have a large effect on climate through the aerosol indirect effect 
  a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct
at the earth s surface  was observed from 1961 until at least 1990 
known as aerosols  produced by volcanoes and human-made   are thought to be the main cause of this dimming  they exert a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight  the effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion co2 and aerosols have partially offset one another in recent decades  so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-co2 greenhouse gases such as methane  radiative forcing due to aerosols is temporally limited due to the processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere 
gives tropospheric aerosols an
of only about a week  while
aerosols can remain for a few years  carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more  and as such  changes in aerosols will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide 
is second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming 
in addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation  aerosols have indirect effects on the   sulfate aerosols act as
and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets  these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets  a phenomenon known as the   this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size  which reduces
and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight  known as the   indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds  and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds  indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing 
may either cool or warm earth s   depending on whether it is airborne or deposited  atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation  which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface  in isolated areas with high soot production  such as rural india  as much as 50  of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by   when deposited  especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions  the lower surface
can also directly heat the surface  the influences of atmospheric particles  including black carbon  are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics  particularly in asia  while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere

and nitrous oxide 
solar activity
main article 
since 1978 
has been measured by   these measurements indicate that the sun s radiative output has not increased since 1978  so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the earth 
climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change  models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity  models are  however  able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings  including human influences and natural forcings 
another line of evidence against solar variations having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the earth s atmosphere have changed  models and observations show that greenhouse warming results in warming of the lower atmosphere  the troposphere  but cooling of the upper atmosphere  the stratosphere   depletion of the ozone layer by chemical
has also resulted in a strong cooling effect in the stratosphere  if solar variations were responsible for observed warming  warming of both the troposphere and stratosphere would be expected 
variations in earth s orbit
main article 
the tilt of the earths axis and the shape of its orbit around the sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years and are a natural source of climate change  by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar  
during the last few thousand years  this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during summer  a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century 
variations in orbital cycles may initiate a new
in the future  though the timing of this depends on greenhouse gas concentrations as well as the orbital forcing  a new glacial period is not expected within the next 50,000 years if atmospheric co2 concentration remains above 300 ppm 
feedback

and
sea ice  shown here in   in northern canada  reflects more sunshine  while open ocean absorbs more  accelerating melting 
the climate system includes a range of feedbacks  which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings  positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing  while negative feedbacks reduce it 
there are a range of feedbacks in the climate system  including   changes in
 snow and ice cover affect how much the earth s surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight   clouds  and changes in the earth s carbon cycle  e g   the release of carbon from    the main negative feedback is the energy the earth s surface
into space as   according to the   if the
 as measured in   doubles  radiated energy increases by a factor of 16  2 to the 4th power  
feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations  other factors being equal  a higher
means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing  uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario  more research is needed to understand the role of clouds and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections 
the ipcc projections previously mentioned span the  likely  range  greater than 66  probability  based on expert judgement  for the selected emissions scenarios  however  the ipcc s projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty  the lower end of the  likely  range appears to be better constrained than the upper end

of the physical  chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system  such models are based on scientific disciplines such as
and
as well as physical processes such as   the models may be used to predict a range of variables such as local air movement  temperature  clouds  and other atmospheric properties  ocean temperature    and   ice cover on land and sea  the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere  and chemical and biological processes  among others 
although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible  simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system  results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model s climate sensitivity  for example  the uncertainty in ipcc s 2007 projections is caused by  1  the use of multiple models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations   2  the use of differing estimates of humanity s future greenhouse gas emissions   3  any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models ipcc used to prepare its report  i e   greenhouse gas releases from permafrost 
the models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases  instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes  warming or cooling is thus a result  not an assumption  of the models 
clouds and their effects are especially difficult to predict  improving the models  representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current research  another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon cycle 
models are also used to help investigate the
by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes  although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects  they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates  climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century  but do not simulate all aspects of climate  not all

land areas  and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some
regions  projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events  such as  
a 2015 study published in   states 

about 18  of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times  which in turn primarily results from human influence  for 2 c of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40   likewise  today about 75  of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming  it is the most rare and extreme events for which the largest fraction is anthropogenic  and that contribution increases nonlinearly with further warming 

data analysis of extreme events from 1960 till 2010 suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased frequency  extremely wet or dry events within the

could rise by 5298cm  the ipcc s projections are conservative  and may underestimate future sea level rise  other estimates suggest that for the same period  global mean sea level could rise by 0.2 to 2.0 m  0.76.6ft   relative to mean sea level in 1992

would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for millennia  for example  sustained global warming of more than 2c  relative to pre-industrial levels  could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1 to 4 m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small   melting of the
could contribute an additional 4 to 7.5m over many thousands of years  it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 metres for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years 
warming beyond the 2c target would potentially lead to rates of sea-level rise dominated by ice loss from   continued co2 emissions from fossil sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise  over the next millennia and eventually ultimately eliminate the entire antarctic ice sheet  causing about 58 metres of sea level rise

long-term effects
main article 
on the timescale of centuries to millennia  the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions  this is due to carbon dioxide s very long lifetime in the atmosphere 
stabilizing the global average temperature would require large reductions in co2 emissions  as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide  emissions of co2 would need to be reduced by more than 80  relative to their peak level  even if this were achieved  global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many centuries 
long-term effects also include a response from the earth s crust  due to ice melting and deglaciation  in a process called   when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice  this could lead to
and increased seismic and volcanic activities  tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor permafrost or releasing   some world regions  such as the french alps  already show signs of an increase in landslide frequency

other policy responses include
to climate change  adaptation to climate change may be planned  either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change  or spontaneous  i e   without government intervention  planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis  the barriers  limits  and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood 
a concept related to adaptation is   which is the ability of a system  human  natural or managed  to adjust to climate change  including climate variability and extremes  to moderate potential damages  to take advantage of opportunities  or to cope with consequences  unmitigated climate change  i e   future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions  would  in the long term  be likely to exceed the capacity of natural  managed and human systems to adapt 
environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail  while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions 
climate engineering
main article 
 sometimes called geoengineering or climate intervention  is the deliberate modification of the climate  it has been investigated as a possible response to global warming  e g  by nasa and the   techniques under research fall generally into the categories
and   although various other schemes have been suggested  a study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change

sessions of
article 2 of the un framework convention refers explicitly to  stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations   to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of co
2  emissions worldwide would need to be dramatically reduced from their present level 
most countries in the world are parties to the
 unfccc   the ultimate objective of the convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system  as stated in the convention  this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where
can adapt naturally to climate change 
is not threatened  and
can proceed in a sustainable fashion  the framework convention was agreed in 1992  but since then  global emissions have risen 
during negotiations  the
 a lobbying group in the united nations representing 133 developing nations  4 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to   take  the lead  in reducing their emissions  this was justified on the basis that  the developed world s emissions had contributed most to the
of ghgs in the atmosphere 
 i e   emissions per head of population  were still relatively low in developing countries  and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs  290
this mandate was sustained in the
to the framework convention  290 which entered into legal effect in 2005  in ratifying the kyoto protocol  most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions  these first-round commitments expired in 2012  united states president
rejected the treaty on the basis that  it exempts 80  of the world  including major population centres such as china and india  from compliance  and would cause serious harm to the us economy   5

in 2010  it produced an agreement  not a binding treaty  that the parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to 70022751499999999992c above pre-industrial temperatures  it also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of 70022746499999999991.5c

from 1990 to 1997 
think tanks in the united states mobilized to challenge the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem  they   argued that   and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good  some people dispute aspects of climate change science  organizations such as the
  conservative commentators  and some companies such as
have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios  funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus  and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls  on the other hand  some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years  or even called for policies to reduce global warming  global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels 
surveys of public opinion
main article 
the world public  or at least people in economically advanced regions  became broadly aware of the global warming problem in the late 1980s  polling groups began to track opinions on the subject  at first mainly in the united states  the longest consistent polling  by
in the us  found relatively small deviations of 10  or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming  but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned 
the first major worldwide poll  conducted by gallup in 2008-2009 in 127 countries  found that some 62  of people worldwide said they knew about global warming  in the advanced countries of north america  europe and japan  90  or more knew about it  97  in the u s   99  in japan   in less developed countries  especially in africa  fewer than a quarter knew about it  although many had noticed local weather changes  among those who knew about global warming  there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities 
by 2010  with 111 countries surveyed  gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease since 200708 in the number of americans and europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat  in the us  just a little over half the population  53   now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families  this was 10 points below the 2008 poll  63    latin america had the biggest rise in concern  73  said global warming is a serious threat to their families  this global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes  except in the us where nearly half  47   of the population attributed global warming to natural causes 
a marchmay 2013 survey by
polled 39 countries about global threats  according to 54  of those questioned  global warming featured top of the perceived global threats  in a january 2013 survey  pew found that 69  of americans say there is solid evidence that the earth s average temperature has got warmer over the past few decades  up six points since november 2011 and 12 points since 2009 
a 2010 survey of 14 industrialized countries found that
about the danger of global warming was highest in australia  norway  new zealand and the united states  in that order  correlating positively with  
etymology
in the 1950s  research suggested increasing temperatures  and a 1952 newspaper reported  climate change   this phrase next appeared in a november 1957 report in
which described  s research into the effects of increasing human-caused co2 emissions on the    a large scale global warming  with radical climate changes may result   both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975  when
published a scientific paper on the topic   climatic change  are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming   the phrase began to come into common use  and in 1976  s statement that  a global warming up has started  was widely reported  other studies  such as a 1971
report  referred to the human impact as  inadvertent climate modification   but an influential 1979
study headed by
followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures  while describing the wider effects of increased co2 as climate change 
in 1986 and november 1987  nasa climate scientist
gave testimony to congress on global warming  there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988  and when hansen testified in the senate on 23 june he sparked worldwide interest  he said   global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming   public attention increased over the summer  and global warming became the dominant popular term  commonly used both by the press and in public discourse 
in a 2008 nasa article on usage 
defined global warming as  the increase in earths average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases   while climate change was  a long-term change in the earths climate  or of a region on earth   as effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone  he considered global climate change a more scientifically accurate term  and like the   the nasa website would emphasize this wider context

notes
scientific journals use  global warming  to describe an increasing global average temperature just at earth s surface  and most of these authorities further limit  global warming  to such increases caused by human activities or increasing greenhouse gases 
the 2001 joint statement was signed by the national academies of science of australia  belgium  brazil  canada  the caribbean  the people s republic of china  france  germany  india  indonesia  ireland  italy  malaysia  new zealand  sweden  and the uk  the 2005 statement added japan  russia  and the u s  the 2007 statement added mexico and south africa  the   and the
have issued separate statements  professional scientific societies include                               -stratigraphy commission              and  
earth has already experienced almost 1/2 of the 2.0c  3.6f  described in the cancn agreement  in the last 100 years  earth s average surface temperature increased by about 0.8c  1.4f  with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades 
the greenhouse effect produces an average worldwide temperature increase of about 33c  59f  compared to
predictions without the greenhouse effect  not an average surface temperature of 33c  91f   the average worldwide surface temperature is about 14c  57f  
a rise in temperature from 10 c to 20 c is not a doubling of   a rise from  273   10  k   283 k to  273   20  k   293 k is an increase of  293  283  283   3.5
