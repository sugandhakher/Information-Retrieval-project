history  
spanish era  
the area was claimed by the spanish in 1769  and in 1772 commander
became the first european to enter it  from the south by way of the  
kern county was the site of the battle of san emigdio  in march 1824  between the
indians of the
who rebelled against the mexican government s taking over mission property and ejecting the natives  this battle with mexican forces from
under the command of carlos carrillo took place at the canyon where san emigdio creek flows down
and the blue ridge south of bakersfield near today s highway 166  it was a low-casualty encounter  with only four indians killed  and no mexicans  the surviving indians were pacified and brought back to santa barbara in june 1824 after a pursuit and negotiation in which many were allowed to keep their arms for the return march over the mountains 
american era  
the havilah court building was restored in the 1970s and now serves as a museum  photo circa 2007 
in the beginning  the area that became kern county was dominated by mining in the mountains and in the desert  in 1855 an attempt to form a county in the area was made when the california legislature took the southeastern territory of tulare county on the west of the sierra nevada mountains for   but it was never officially organized prior to 1859  when the time of the enabling legislation ran out  the south of tulare county was later organized as kern county in 1866  with additions from los angeles and san bernardino counties  its first county seat was in the mining town of   in the mountains between bakersfield and    
the flatlands were considered inhospitable and impassable at the time due to swamps  lakes  tule reeds and diseases such as malaria  this changed when settlers started draining lands for farming and constructing canals  most dug by hand by hired chinese laborers  within 10 years the valley surpassed the mining areas as the economic center of the county  and the county seat was moved as a result from havilah to bakersfield in 1874   
the discovery well of the
was dug by hand in 1899  soon the towns of  
and
came into existence 
etymology  
the county derives its name from the   which was named for  
for general  s 1845 expedition  which crossed   the kern river was originally named rio bravo de san felipe by father francisco garces when he explored the area in 1776

on
with the
about 23 miles  37km  south of bakersfield  measuring 7.3 on the
killed 12 people  in addition to the deaths  it was responsible for at least 18 injuries and more than  60 million in property damage  the main shock was felt over much of california and as far away as phoenix  arizona and reno  nevada  the earthquake occurred on the white wolf fault and was the strongest to occur in california since the  
suffered the greatest damage and loss of life from the earthquake  though its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern california  the event had a significant
sequence that persisted into july and august with the strongest coming on august 22  an m5.8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of viii  severe  and resulted in two additional deaths and an additional  10 million in property damage  repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving non-reinforced masonry buildings 
following the event  a field survey was conducted along the fault zone with the goal of estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators  ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed  both in the valley and in the foothills  with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicenter area  the strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant  and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event  and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers
