generation and other applications of
or   such as
and   radioactive waste is
to most forms of life and the environment  and is
by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment 
radioactivity naturally decays over time  so radioactive waste has to be isolated and confined in appropriate disposal facilities for a sufficient period until it no longer poses a threat  the time radioactive waste must be stored for depends on the type of waste and radioactive isotopes  it can range from a few days for highly radioactive isotopes to millions of years for slightly radioactive ones  current major approaches to managing radioactive waste have been segregation and storage for short-lived waste  near-surface disposal for low and some intermediate level waste  and
or
for the high-level waste 
a summary of the amounts of radioactive waste and management approaches for most developed countries are presented and reviewed periodically as part of the

nature and significance of radioactive waste  
radioactive waste typically comprises a number of   unstable configurations of elements that   emitting
which can be harmful to humans and the environment  those isotopes emit different types and levels of radiation  which last for different periods of time

the radioactivity of all radioactive waste diminishes with time  all radionuclides contained in the waste have a the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into another and eventually all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements  i e      certain radioactive elements  such as   will remain hazardous to humans and other creatures for hundreds or thousands of years  other radionuclides remain radioactive for millions of years  though most of these products have so little activity as a result of their long half-lives that their radiation is lost in the    thus  these wastes must be shielded for centuries and isolated from the living
for millennia  since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule  the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay  in other words  the radiation from a long-lived isotope like
will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like   the two tables show some of the major radioisotopes  their half-lives  and their
as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235 
the energy and the type of the
emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans  the chemical properties of the radioactive
will determine how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and
humans  this is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to radioactive
within a
before ultimately reaching a stable state

exposure to radioactive waste may cause serious harm or death  in   a dose of 1
carries a 5.5  risk of developing cancer  and this risk is assumed to be
even for low doses  ionizing radiation causes deletions in chromosomes  if a developing organism such as an
is irradiated  it is possible a
may be induced  but it is unlikely this defect will be in a
or a gamete-forming   the incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small  as in most mammals  because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms  many just now coming to light  these mechanisms range from dna  mrna and protein repair  to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins  and even induced cell suicideapoptosis
depending on the decay mode and the
 how the body processes it and how quickly   the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a
will differ  for instance
is a short-lived
and
emitter  but because it concentrates in the
gland  it is more able to cause injury than -137 which  being   is rapidly excreted in urine  in a similar way  the
emitting actinides and
are considered very harmful as they tend to have long
and their radiation has a high   making it far more damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited  because of such differences  the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope  time of exposure and sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope 
sources of waste  
radioactive waste comes from a number of sources  in countries with nuclear power plants  nuclear armament  or nuclear fuel treatment plants  the majority of waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing  otherwise there is no waste of nuclear origin    other sources include medical and industrial wastes  as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials  norm  that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal  oil and gas  and some minerals  as discussed below 
nuclear fuel cycle  
main articles 
and
this article is about radioactive waste  for contextual information  see  
front end  
waste from the front end of the
is usually alpha-emitting waste from the extraction of uranium  it often contains radium and its decay products 
 uo2  concentrate from mining is not very radioactive only a thousand or so times as radioactive as the
used in buildings  it is refined from
 u3o8   then converted to
gas  uf6   as a gas  it undergoes
to increase the
content from 0.7  to about 4.4   leu   it is then turned into a hard
oxide  uo2  for assembly as reactor fuel elements 
the main by-product of enrichment is
 du   principally the
isotope  with a u-235 content of  0.3   it is stored  either as uf6 or as u3o8  some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as
  even sailboat
on at least   it is also used with plutonium for making
 mox  and to dilute  or   highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel 
back end  
see also 
the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle  mostly spent   contains
that emit beta and gamma radiation  and
that emit   such as    
and   and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as
 cf   these isotopes are formed in  
it is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the
of used fuel  used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of fission  see high level waste below   many of these are neutron absorbers  called
in this context  these eventually build up to a level where they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops  even with the control rods completely removed  at that point the fuel has to be replaced in the reactor with fresh fuel  even though there is still a substantial quantity of
and
present  in the united states  this used fuel is usually  stored   while in other countries such as russia  the united kingdom  france  japan and india  the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products  and the fuel can then be re-used  thus cutting costs  reducing health risks  saving time  and in general being far safer  the fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process  while these countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles  india is the only country known to be planning multiple plutonium recycling schemes 
fuel composition and long term radioactivity  
see also 
and
activity of u-233 for three fuel types
total activity for three fuel types
long-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for
 snf   when looking at long term radioactive decay  the actinides in the snf have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives  depending on what a
is fueled with  the actinide composition in the snf will be different 
an example of this effect is the use of
with   th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays  resulting in the production of fissile   the snf of a cycle with thorium will contain u-233  its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term
curve of the snf around 1 million years  a comparison of the activity associated to u-233 for three different snf types can be seen in the figure on the top right 
the burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium  rgpu   thorium with weapons-grade plutonium  wgpu  and
 mox   for rgpu and wgpu  the initial amount of u-233 and its decay around 1 million years can be seen  this has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types  the absence of u-233 and its daughter products in the mox fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right  whereas for rgpu and wgpu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of u-233 that has not fully decayed 
the use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different snf composition  with varying activity curves 
proliferation concerns  
see also 
and
since uranium and plutonium are
materials  there have been proliferation concerns  ordinarily  in    plutonium is   in addition to   which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons  it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants      and   these isotopes are extremely difficult to separate  and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist  e g  uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors  
high-level waste is full of highly radioactive   most of which are relatively short-lived  this is a concern since if the waste is stored  perhaps in   over many years the fission products decay  decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access  the undesirable contaminant pu-240 decays faster than the pu-239  and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time  although its quantity decreases during that time as well   thus  some have argued  as time passes  these deep storage areas have the potential to become  plutonium mines   from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty  critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable  specifically  the high radioactivity and heat  80 c in surrounding rock  greatly increases the difficulty of mining a storage area  and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs 
pu-239 decays to
which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half-life  roughly 109 years   thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235  however  modern reactors are only moderately enriched with u-235 relative to u-238  so the u-238 continues to serve as a
agent for any u-235 produced by plutonium decay 
one solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e g  in   in   the separated plutonium and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons 
nuclear weapons decommissioning  
waste from nuclear weapons decommissioning is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than
and   it is more likely to contain alpha-emitting actinides such as pu-239 which is a fissile material used in bombs  plus some material with much higher specific activities  such as pu-238 or po 
in the past the neutron trigger for an
tended to be
and a high activity alpha emitter such as   an alternative to polonium is   for reasons of national security  details of the design of modern bombs are normally not released to the open literature 
some designs might contain a
using pu-238 to provide a long lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device 
it is likely that the fissile material of an old bomb which is due for refitting will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it  these are likely to include
from pu-240 impurities  plus some u-235 from decay of the pu-239  due to the relatively long half-life of these pu isotopes  these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small  and in any case  far less dangerous  even in terms of simple radioactivity  than the pu-239 itself 
the beta decay of
forms   the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of pu-239 and pu-240 as the americium is a gamma emitter  increasing external-exposure to workers  and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of   the plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes  these would include
processes and aqueous organic   a truncated
type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation  naturally occurring uranium is not fissile because it contains 99.3  of u-238 and only 0.7  of u-235 
legacy waste  
due to historic activities typically related to radium industry  uranium mining  and military programs  there are numerous sites that contain or are contaminated with radioactivity  in the united states alone  the
states there are  millions of gallons of radioactive waste  as well as  thousands of tons of
and material  and also  huge quantities of contaminated soil and water   despite copious quantities of waste  the doe has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025  the  
site for example had  31 million pounds of uranium product    2.5 billion pounds of waste    2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris   and a  223 acre portion of the underlying great miami aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards   the united states has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable  sometimes many thousands of acres  doe wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025  using the recently developed method of     however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated  in just one of these 108 larger designations    there were for example at least  167 known contaminant release sites  in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre  150km2  site  some of the u s  sites were smaller in nature  however  cleanup issues were simpler to address  and doe has successfully completed cleanup  or at least closure  of several sites

naturally occurring radioactive material  norm   
annual release of
and
from coal combustion  predicted by
to cumulatively amount to 2.9 million tons over the 19372040 period  from the combustion of an estimated 637 billion tons of coal worldwide 
substances containing natural radioactivity are known as   after human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity  such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash   it becomes technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material  tenorm   a lot of this waste is -emitting matter from the decay chains of
and   the main source of radiation in the human body is -40     typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams day intake  most rocks  due to their components  have a low level of radioactivity  usually ranging from 1
 msv  to 13msv annually depending on location  average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0msv per person a year worldwide  this makes up the majority of typical total dosage  with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6msv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace  0.4msv from   0.005msv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing  0.005msv occupational exposure  0.002msv from the   and 0.0002msv from the nuclear fuel cycle  
tenorm is not regulated as restrictively as nuclear reactor waste  though there are no significant differences in the radiological risks of these materials 
coal  
contains a small amount of radioactive uranium  barium  thorium and potassium  but  in the case of pure coal  this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the   the surrounding strata  if shale or mudstone  often contain slightly more than average and this may also be reflected in the ash content of  dirty  coals  the more active ash minerals become concentrated in the
precisely because they do not burn well  the radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black
and is less than
rocks  but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled  according to u s 
reports  population exposure from 1000-mwe power plants amounts to 490
for coal power plants  100 times as great as nuclear power plants  4.8 person-rem year    the exposure from the complete nuclear fuel cycle from mining to waste disposal is 136 person-rem year  the corresponding value for coal use from mining to waste disposal is  probably unknown   
oil and gas  
residues from the
and
industry often contain radium and its decay products  the sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich  while the water  oil and gas from a well often contain   the radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework  in an oil processing plant the area of the plant where
is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane 
classification of radioactive waste  
classifications of radioactive waste varies by country  the iaea  which publishes the radioactive waste safety standards  radwass   also plays a significant role 
uranium tailings

low-level waste  
 llw  is generated from hospitals and industry  as well as the   low-level wastes include   rags      filters  and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity  materials that originate from any region of an active area are commonly designated as llw as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials  such llw typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area  such as a normal office block 
some high-activity llw requires shielding during handling and transport but most llw is suitable for shallow land burial  to reduce its volume  it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal  low-level waste is divided into four classes  class a  class b  class c  and greater than class c  gtcc  
intermediate-level waste  
spent fuel
are transported by railway in the united kingdom  each flask is constructed of 14in  360mm  thick solid steel and weighs in excess of 50 tons
intermediate-level waste  ilw  contains higher amounts of radioactivity and in general require shielding  but not cooling  intermediate-level wastes includes  
and metal
cladding  as well as contaminated materials from   it may be solidified in
or
for disposal  as a general rule  short-lived waste  mainly non-fuel materials from reactors  is buried in shallow repositories  while long-lived waste  from fuel and   is deposited in   u s  regulations do not define this category of waste  the term is used in europe and elsewhere 
high-level waste  
 hlw  is produced by nuclear reactors  the exact definition of hlw differs internationally  after a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and is removed from the core  it is considered hlw  fuel rods contain
and
generated in the   spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot  hlw accounts for over 95 percent of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear   the amount of hlw worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000
every year  which is the equivalent to about 100
or a two-story structure with a footprint the size of a   a 1000- nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel  unreprocessed  every year  in 2010  there was very roughly estimated to be stored some 250,000 tons of nuclear hlw  that does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests  japan estimated to hold 17,000 tons of hlw in storage in 2015  hlw have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed  and in some cases  shipped back as active fuel 
the ongoing controversy over
is a major constraint on the nuclear powers global expansion  most scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial  either in a mine or a deep borehole  however  almost six decades after commercial nuclear energy began  no government has succeeded in opening such a repository for civilian high-level nuclear waste  although finland is in the advanced stage of the construction of such facility  the   reprocessing or recycling spent nuclear fuel options already available or under active development still generate waste and so are not a total solution  but can reduce the sheer quantity of waste  and there are many such active programs worldwide  deep geological burial remains the only responsible way to deal with high-level nuclear waste  the
is currently the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the united states 
transuranic waste  
the examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the united states and do not represent a
of the subject  you may   discuss the issue on the   or   as appropriate   november 2013    
 truw  as defined by u s  regulations is  without regard to form or origin  waste that is contaminated with -emitting transuranic
with
greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100 g  3.7 kg   excluding high-level waste  elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic   beyond uranium    because of their long half-lives  truw is disposed more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste  in the u s   it arises mainly from
production  and consists of clothing  tools  rags  residues  debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements  mainly   
under u s  law  transuranic waste is further categorized into  contact-handled   ch  and  remote-handled   rh  on the basis of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the waste container  ch truw has a surface dose rate not greater than 200
per hour  2msv h   whereas rh truw has a surface dose rate of 200mrem h  2msv h  or greater  ch truw does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste  nor its high heat generation  but rh truw can be highly radioactive  with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000 mrem h  10,000msv h   the u s  currently disposes of truw generated from military facilities at the

of particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products  tc-99  half-life 220,000 years  and i-129  half-life 15.7 million years   which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years  the most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are np-237  half-life two million years  and pu-239  half-life 24,000 years   nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the   this usually necessitates treatment  followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage  disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form  governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options  though there has been limited progress toward long-term waste management solutions 
in second half of 20th century  several methods of disposal of radioactive waste were investigated by nuclear nations  which are 
 long term above ground storage   not implemented 
 disposal in outer space   for instance  inside the sun   not implemented - as it would be currently too expensive 
    not implemented 
 rock-melting   not implemented 
 disposal at subduction zones   not implemented 
    done by the ussr  the united kingdom  switzerland  the united states  belgium  france  the netherlands  japan  sweden  russia  germany  italy and south korea   195493  this is no longer permitted by international agreements 
    not implemented  not permitted by international agreements 
 disposal in ice sheets   rejected in
 direct injection   done by ussr and usa 
in the usa  waste management policy completely broke down with the ending of work on the incomplete   at present there are 70 nuclear power plant sites where
is stored  a blue ribbon commission was appointed by president obama to look into future options for this and future waste  a
seems to be favored 
initial treatment of waste  
vitrification  
long-term storage of radioactive waste requires the stabilization of the waste into a form which will neither react nor degrade for extended periods  it is theorized that one way to do this might be through   currently at
the high-level waste   first cycle   is mixed with
and then calcined 
involves passing the waste through a heated  rotating tube  the purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste  and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced 
the  calcine  generated is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented   the resulting glass is a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies  as a melt  this product is poured into
cylindrical containers   cylinders   in a batch process  when cooled  the fluid solidifies   vitrifies   into the glass  after being formed  the glass is highly resistant to water 
after filling a cylinder  a seal is
onto the cylinder head  the cylinder is then washed  after being inspected for external contamination  the steel cylinder is stored  usually in an underground repository  in this form  the waste products are expected to be immobilized for thousands of years 
the glass inside a cylinder is usually a black glossy substance  all this work  in the united kingdom  is done using
systems  sugar is added to control the
chemistry and to stop the formation of the volatile
containing   in the west  the glass is normally a
 similar to    while in the former
bloc it is normal to use a   the amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some    the other pt group metals  and   tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass  bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes  which are then buried underground  in germany a vitrification plant is in use  this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down 
ion exchange  
it is common for medium active wastes in the nuclear industry to be treated with
or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume  the much less radioactive bulk  after treatment  is often then discharged  for instance  it is possible to use a
to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures  after the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide  the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form  in order to get better long-term performance  mechanical stability  from such forms  they may be made from a mixture of   or
  and   instead of normal
 made with portland cement  gravel and sand  
synroc  
the australian
 synthetic rock  is a more sophisticated way to immobilize such waste  and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes  it is currently being developed for us military wastes   synroc was invented by prof ted ringwood  a   at the   the synroc contains
and cryptomelane type minerals  the original form of synroc  synroc c  was designed for the liquid high level waste  purex raffinate  from a   the main minerals in this synroc are hollandite  baal2ti6o16

the time frame in question when dealing with radioactive waste ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years  according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses  researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such periods should be examined critically 
practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned  long term behavior of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research projects in  
above-ground disposal  
typically involves taking waste from a
and sealing it  along with an   in a
cylinder  which is placed in a
cylinder which acts as a radiation shield  it is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor  the waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing 
geologic disposal  
on feb  14  2014  at the   radioactive materials leaked from a damaged storage drum  see photo   analysis of several accidents  by doe  have shown lack of a  safety culture  at the facility 
the process of selecting appropriate
for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2010  the basic concept is to locate a large  stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel  or large-bore
 similar to those used to drill the
from england to france  to drill a shaft 500 metres  1,600ft  to 1,000 metres  3,300ft  below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste  the goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment  many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate
of this disposal system  suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent 
because some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years  even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account  moreover  it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to cease being lethal to living things  a 1983 review of the swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the national academy of sciences found that country s estimate of several hundred thousand yearsperhaps up to one million yearsbeing necessary for waste isolation  fully justified  
of radioactive waste has been suggested by the finding that deep waters in the north atlantic ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded over a period of 25 years  they include burial beneath a stable   burial in a
zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the   and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island  while these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international solution to the problem of disposal of radioactive waste  they would require an
of the  
article 1  definitions   7   of the 1996 protocol to the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter   the london dumping convention  states 
  sea  means all marine waters other than the internal waters of states  as well as the seabed and the subsoil thereof  it does not include sub-seabed repositories accessed only from land  
the proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method disposes of nuclear waste in a
zone accessed from land and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement  this method has been described as the most viable means of disposing of radioactive waste  and as the state-of-the-art as of 2001 in nuclear waste disposal technology  another approach termed remix   return would blend high-level waste with
and mill tailings down to the level of the original radioactivity of the   then replace it in inactive uranium mines  this approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff  and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials  but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing  due to the presence in it of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium 
is the concept of disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in extremely deep boreholes  deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as 5 kilometres  3.1mi  beneath the surface of the earth and relies primarily on the immense natural geological barrier to confine the waste safely and permanently so that it should never pose a threat to the environment  the earth s crust contains 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium  primarily
adding up over the crust s 3   1019 ton mass   among other natural radioisotopes  since the fraction of nuclides decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to an isotope s half-life  the relative radioactivity of the lesser amount of human-produced radioisotopes  thousands of tons instead of trillions of tons  would diminish once the isotopes with far shorter half-lives than the bulk of natural radioisotopes decayed 
in january 2013 
rejected uk central government proposals to start work on an underground storage dump for nuclear waste near to the    for any host community  there will be a substantial community benefits package and worth hundreds of millions of pounds  said ed davey  energy secretary  but nonetheless  the local elected body voted 73 against research continuing  after hearing evidence from independent geologists that  the fractured strata of the county was impossible to entrust with such dangerous material and a hazard lasting millennia  
transmutation  
main article 
there have been proposals for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other  less-harmful nuclear waste  in particular  the
was a proposed nuclear reactor with a nuclear fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and in fact  could consume transuranic waste  it proceeded as far as large-scale tests  but was then canceled by the us government  another approach  considered safer but requiring more development  is to dedicate
to the
of the left-over transuranic elements 
an isotope that is found in nuclear waste and that represents a concern in terms of proliferation is pu-239  the estimated world total of plutonium in the year 2000 was of 1,645 metric tons  of which 210 metric tons had been separated by reprocessing    the large stock of plutonium is a result of its production inside uranium-fueled reactors and of the reprocessing of weapons-grade plutonium during the weapons program  an option for getting rid of this plutonium is to use it as a fuel in a traditional light water reactor  lwr   several fuel types with differing plutonium destruction efficiencies are under study 
transmutation was banned in the us in april 1977 by president carter due to the danger of plutonium proliferation  but president reagan rescinded the ban in 1981  due to the economic losses and risks  construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume  due to high energy demand  work on the method has continued in the   this has resulted in a practical nuclear research reactor called
in which transmutation is possible  additionally  a new research program called actinet has been started in the
to make transmutation possible on a large  industrial scale  according to president bush s global nuclear energy partnership  gnep  of 2007  the us is now actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment 
there have also been theoretical studies involving the use of
as so called  actinide burners  where a fusion reactor
such as in a   could be  doped  with a small amount of the  minor  transuranic atoms which would be transmuted  meaning fissioned in the actinide case  to lighter elements upon their successive bombardment by the very high energy neutrons produced by the fusion of
and
in the reactor  a study at
found that only 2 or 3 fusion reactors with parameters similar to that of the
 iter  could transmute the entire annual
production from all of the
presently operating in the
while simultaneously generating approximately 1
of power from each reactor 
re-use of waste  
main article 
another option is to find applications for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to
them  already   
and a few other isotopes are extracted for certain industrial applications such as
and   while re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes  it reduces the quantity of waste produced 
the nuclear assisted hydrocarbon production method  canadian patent application 2,659,302  is a method for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an
formation  the thermal flux of the waste materials fracture the formation and alters the chemical and or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material  a mixture of hydrocarbons  hydrogen  and or other formation fluids is produced from the formation  the radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in the periphery of the repository or the deepest portion of a borehole 
can run on u-238 and transuranic elements  which comprise the majority of spent fuel radioactivity in the 1,000100,000-year time span 
space disposal  
space disposal is attractive because it removes nuclear waste from the planet  it has significant disadvantages  such as the potential for catastrophic failure of a   which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world  a high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket would be able to carry very much of the material relative to the total amount that needs to be disposed of  this makes the proposal impractical economically and it increases the risk of at least one or more launch failures  to further complicate matters  international agreements on the regulation of such a program would need to be established  costs and inadequate reliability of modern rocket launch systems for space disposal has been one of the motives for interest in
systems such as     and other proposals   
national management plans  
see also 
most countries are considerably ahead of the united states in developing plans for high-level radioactive waste disposal  sweden and finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology  while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with france or great britain to do it  taking back the resulting plutonium and high-level waste   an increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries    it is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium  
in many european countries  e g   britain  finland  the netherlands  sweden and switzerland  the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the international commission on radiation protection or proposed in the united states  european limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the international commission on radiation protection by a factor of 20  and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the us environmental protection agency  epa  for
for the first 10,000 years after closure 
the u s  epa s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the european limit  the u s  epa proposed a legal limit of a maximum of 3.5
 350   each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years  which would be up to several percent of   the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on earth  though the u s 
predicted that   over a timeframe of thousands of years  after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed  burying u s  nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the
 10 million km2  by
1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of
in such a volume  but the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average 
mongolia  
after serious opposition had arisen   about plans and negotiations between
with japan and the united states of america to build nuclear-waste facilities in mongolia  mongolia stopped all negotiations in september 2011  these negotiations had started after u s  deputy secretary of energy
visited mongolia in september  2010  talks took place in washington dc between officials of japan  the united states and mongolia in february 2011  after this the
 uae   which wanted to buy nuclear fuel from mongolia  joined in the negotiations  the talks were kept secret  and although the
reported on them in may  mongolia officially denied the existence of these negotiations  however  alarmed by this news  mongolian citizens protested against the plans  and demanded the government withdraw the plans and disclose information  the mongolian president
issued a presidential order on september 13 banning all negotiations with foreign governments or international organizations on nuclear-waste storage plans in mongolia  the mongolian government has accused the newspaper of distributing false claims around the world  after the presidential order  the mongolian president fired the individual who was supposedly involved in these conversations 
illegal dumping  
main article 
authorities in italy are investigating a
mafia clan accused of trafficking and illegally dumping nuclear waste  according to a   a manager of the italy s state energy research agency
paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from italy  switzerland  france  germany  and the us  with
as the destination  where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians  former employees of enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s  shipments to somalia continued into the 1990s  while the  ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste  including radioactive hospital waste  and sending them to the sea bed off the
coast  according to the environmental group   former members of the  ndrangheta have said that they were paid to sink ships with radioactive material for the last 20 years 
accidents involving radioactive waste  
main article 
a few incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly  shielding during transport was defective  or when it was simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store  in the soviet union  waste stored in
was blown over the area during a
after the lake had partly dried out  at   a low-level radioactive waste facility located in   containment trenches covered with dirt  instead of steel or cement  collapsed under heavy rainfall into the trenches and filled with water  the water that invaded the trenches became radioactive and had to be disposed of at the maxey flat facility itself  in other cases of radioactive waste accidents  lakes or ponds with radioactive waste accidentally overflowed into the rivers during exceptional storms    in italy  several radioactive waste deposits let material flow into river water  thus contaminating water for domestic use  in france  in the summer of 2008 numerous incidents happened  in one  at the areva plant in   it was reported that during a draining operation  liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and  from there  into two rivers nearby  in another case  over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation 
scavenging of abandoned radioactive material has been the cause of several other cases of   mostly in   which may have less regulation of dangerous substances  and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards  and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal  the scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its
or scrap value  irresponsibility on the part of the radioactive material s owners  usually a hospital  university or military  and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste  or a lack of enforcement of such regulations  have been significant factors in radiation exposures  for an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the  
transportation accidents involving spent nuclear fuel from power plants are unlikely to have serious consequences due to the strength of the  
on 15 december 2011 top government spokesman osamu fujimura of the japanese government admitted that nuclear substances were found in the waste of japanese nuclear facilities  although japan did commit itself in 1977 to these inspections in the safeguard agreement with the iaea  the reports were kept secret for the inspectors of the     japan did start discussions with the iaea about the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium that were discovered in nuclear waste cleared away by japanese nuclear operators    at the press conference fujimura said   based on investigations so far  most nuclear substances have been properly managed as waste  and from that perspective  there is no problem in safety management   but according to him  the matter was at that moment still being investigated
