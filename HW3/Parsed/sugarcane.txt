sugarcane and bowl of refined sugar
sugarcane  or sugar cane  is one    of the several species of tall
of the genus   tribe   native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of
and   and used for
production  it has stout  jointed  fibrous stalks that are rich in the
  which accumulates in the   the plant is 2 to 6m  6ft 7in to 19ft 8in  tall  all sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial
are complex   sugarcane belongs to the grass family poaceae  an economically important seed plant family that includes maize  wheat  rice  and   and many
crops 
sucrose  extracted and purified in specialized mill factories  is used as raw material in human food industries or is fermented to produce   ethanol is produced on a large scale by the brazilian sugarcane industry  sugarcane is the world s largest crop by production quantity  in 2012  the
estimates it was cultivated on about 26106 hectares  6.4107 acres   in more than 90 countries  with a worldwide harvest of 1.83109 tonnes  1.80109 long tons  2.02109 short tons   brazil was the largest producer of sugar cane in the world  the next five major producers  in decreasing amounts of production  were india  china  thailand  pakistan  and mexico 
the world demand for sugar is the primary driver of sugarcane agriculture  cane accounts for 80  of sugar produced  most of the rest is made from   sugarcane predominantly grows in the tropical and subtropical regions  sugar beets grow in colder temperate regions   other than sugar  products derived from sugarcane include      
 a traditional spirit from brazil     and ethanol  in some regions  people use sugarcane reeds to make pens  mats  screens  and thatch  the young  unexpanded
of tebu telor is eaten raw  steamed  or toasted  and prepared in various ways in certain island communities of indonesia 
the persians  followed by the greeks  discovered the famous  reeds that produce honey without bees  in india between the 6th and 4th centuries bc  they adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture  merchants began to trade in sugar from india  which was considered a luxury and an expensive spice  in the 18th century ad  sugarcane plantations began in caribbean  south american  indian ocean and pacific island nations and the need for laborers became a major driver of large human migrations  including

description  
sugarcane is a tropical  perennial grass that forms lateral shoots at the base to produce multiple stems  typically three to fourm  10 to 13ft  high and about 5cm  2in  in diameter  the stems grow into cane stalk  which when mature constitutes around 75  of the entire plant  a mature stalk is typically composed of 1116  fiber  1216  soluble sugars  23  nonsugars  and 6373  water  a sugarcane crop is sensitive to the climate  soil type  irrigation  fertilizers  insects  disease control  varieties  and the harvest period  the average yield of cane stalk is 6070 tonnes per hectare  2428long ton acre  2731short ton acre  per year  however  this figure can vary between 30 and 180 tonnes per hectare depending on knowledge and crop management approach used in sugarcane cultivation  sugarcane is a   but it is also used as livestock fodder

sugarcane is indigenous to tropical
and   different species likely originated in different locations  with
originating in
and s  edule and s  officinarum in   it is theorized that sugarcane was first domesticated as a crop in new guinea around 6000 bc  new guinean farmers and other early cultivators of sugarcane chewed the plant for its sweet juice  early farmers in southeast asia  and elsewhere  may have also boiled the cane juice down to a viscous mass to facilitate transportation  but the earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern india  the exact date of the first cane sugar production is unclear  the earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient sanskrit and pali texts 
around the 8th century 
traders introduced sugar from
to the other parts of the
in the         and   by the 10th century  sources state that no village in
did not grow sugarcane  it was among the early crops brought to the americas by the spanish  mainly andalusians  from their fields in the   and the
from their fields in the  
first brought sugarcane to the
during his second voyage to the   initially to the island of
 modern day
and the    in colonial times  sugar formed one side of the
of new world raw materials  along with european manufactured goods  and african   sugar  often in the form of molasses  was shipped from the caribbean to europe or new england  where it was used to make rum  the profits from the sale of sugar were then used to purchase manufactured goods  which were then shipped to west africa  where they were bartered for slaves  the slaves were then brought back to the caribbean to be sold to sugar planters  the profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar  which was shipped to europe 
in the british colony of   1823

into raw sugar  these houses were attached to sugar plantations in the western colonies  slaves often ran the boiling process under very poor conditions  rectangular boxes of brick or stone served as furnaces  with an opening at the bottom to stoke the fire and remove ashes  at the top of each furnace were up to seven copper kettles or boilers  each one smaller and hotter than the previous one  the cane juice began in the largest kettle  the juice was then heated and lime added to remove impurities  the juice was skimmed and then channeled to successively smaller kettles  the last kettle  the  teache   was where the cane juice became syrup  the next step was a cooling trough  where the sugar crystals hardened around a sticky core of molasses  this raw sugar was then shoveled from the cooling trough into
 wooden barrels   and from there into the curing house

in the   slaves were liberated after 1833 and many would no longer work on sugarcane plantations when they had a choice  british owners of sugarcane plantations therefore needed new workers  and they found cheap labour in china  portugal and india  the people were subject to   a long-established form of contract which bound them to forced labour for a fixed term  apart from the fixed term of servitude  this resembled slavery  the first ships carrying indentured labourers from india left in 1836  the migrations to serve sugarcane plantations led to a significant number of ethnic indians  southeast asians and chinese settling in various parts of the world  in some islands and countries  the
migrants now constitute between 10 to 50 percent of the population  sugarcane plantations and asian ethnic groups continue to thrive in countries such as                                     and

cultivation  
sugarcane plantation in
sugarcane cultivation requires a
or
climate  with a minimum of 60cm  24in  of annual moisture  it is one of the most
in the   it is a   able to convert up to 1  of incident solar energy into biomass  in prime growing regions  such as                             the       and   sugarcane crops can produce over 15 kg m2 of cane  once a major crop of the southeastern region of the united states  sugarcane cultivation has declined there in recent decades  and is now primarily confined to
and  
sugarcane is cultivated in the tropics and subtropics in areas with a plentiful supply of water  for a continuous period of more than 6-7 months each year  either from natural rainfall or through irrigation  the crop does not tolerate severe frosts  therefore  most of the world s sugarcane is grown between
and   and some up to
and   when sugarcane crop is found outside this range  such as the
region of south africa  it is normally due to anomalous climatic conditions in the region  such as warm ocean currents that sweep down the coast  in terms of altitude  sugarcane crop is found up to 1,600m close to the equator in countries such as     and  
sugarcane can be grown on many soils ranging from highly fertile well-drained   through heavy cracking   infertile acid   peaty   to rocky   both plentiful sunshine and water supplies increase cane production  this has made desert countries with good irrigation facilities such as egypt some of the highest-yielding sugarcane-cultivating regions 
sugarcane flower in
although sugarcanes produce seeds  modern stem cutting has become the most common reproduction method  each cutting must contain at least one bud  and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted  in more technologically advanced countries like the united states and australia 
is common  billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground  once planted  a stand can be harvested several times  after each harvest  the cane sends up new stalks  called   successive harvests give decreasing yields  eventually justifying replanting  two to 10 harvests are usually made depending on the type of culture  in a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields  like in north america  sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields  in countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting  like in the french island   sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting

sugarcane mechanical harvest in    
sugarcane is harvested by hand and mechanically  hand harvesting accounts for more than half of production  and is dominant in the developing world  in hand harvesting  the field is first set on fire  the fire burns dry leaves  and chases away or kills any lurking venomous snakes  without harming the stalks and roots  harvesters then cut the cane just above ground-level using
or   a skilled harvester can cut 500kg  1,100lb  of sugarcane per hour   
mechanical harvesting uses a   or   the austoft 7000 series  the original modern harvester design  has now been copied by other companies  including cameco   the machine cuts the cane at the base of the stalk  strips the leaves  chops the cane into consistent lengths and deposits it into a transporter following alongside  the harvester then blows the trash back onto the field  such machines can harvest 100 long tons  100t  each hour  however  harvested cane must be rapidly processed  once cut  sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content  and damage to the cane during mechanical harvesting accelerates this decline  this decline is offset because a modern chopper harvester can complete the harvest faster and more efficiently than hand cutting and loading  austoft also developed a series of hydraulic high-lift infield transporters to work alongside their harvesters to allow even more rapid transfer of cane to  for example  the nearest railway siding  this mechanical harvesting doesn t require the field to be set on fire  the remains left in the field by the machine consist of the top of the sugar cane and the dead leaves  which act as mulch for the next round of planting

pests  
the
 also known as cane grub  can substantially reduce crop yield by eating roots  it can be controlled with
 confidor  or
 lorsban   other important pests are the
of some
species  including the   the
 diatraea saccharalis   the mexican rice borer   loftini   leaf-cutting ants   
 especially mahanarva fimbriolata and deois flavopicta   and the
migdolus fryanus  the
insect
acts as a
vector  which causes the sugarcane disease  
pathogens  
main article 
numerous pathogens infect sugarcane  such as sugarcane grassy shoot disease caused by   whiptail disease or   pokkah boeng caused by  
bacteria causes   and
disease caused by  
diseases affecting sugarcane include     and  
nitrogen fixation  
some sugarcane varieties are capable of
in association with the bacterium   unlike
and other nitrogen-fixing plants that form
in the soil in association with bacteria  g  diazotrophicus lives within the intercellular spaces of the sugarcane s stem  coating seeds with the bacteria is a newly developed technology that can enable every crop species to fix nitrogen for its own use 
conditions for sugarcane workers  
at least 20,000 people are estimated to have died of chronic kidney disease  ckd  in central america in the past two decades  most of them sugar cane workers along the pacific coast  this may be due to working long hours in the heat without adequate fluid intake 
processing  
traditionally  sugarcane processing requires two stages  mills extract raw sugar from freshly harvested cane and  mill-white sugar is sometimes produced immediately after the first stage at sugar-extraction mills  intended for local consumption  sugar crystals appear naturally in white color during the crystallization process  sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules as well as to stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation  refineries  often located nearer to consumers in north america  europe  and japan  then produce refined white sugar  which is 99 percent sucrose  these two stages are slowly merging  increasing affluence in the sugar-producing tropics increased demand for refined sugar products  driving a trend toward combined milling and refining

sugarcane processing produces cane sugar  sucrose  from sugarcane  other products of the processing include bagasse  molasses  and filtercake 
  the residual dry fiber of the cane after cane juice has been extracted  is used for several purposes 
fuel for the boilers and kilns 
production of paper  paperboard products  and reconstituted panelboard 
agricultural mulch  and
as a raw material for production of chemicals

the primary use of bagasse and bagasse residue is as a fuel source for the boilers in the generation of process steam in sugar plants  dried filtercake is used as an animal feed supplement  fertilizer  and source of sugarcane wax 
molasses is produced in two forms    which has a characteristic strong flavor  and a purer
syrup  blackstrap molasses is sold as a food and dietary supplement  it is also a common ingredient in animal feed  is used to produce
and   and in the manufacturing of   purer molasses syrups are sold as molasses  and may also be blended with   invert sugars  or   both forms of molasses are used in baking

further purifies the raw sugar  it is first mixed with heavy syrup and then centrifuged in a process called  affination   its purpose is to wash away the sugar crystals  outer coating  which is less pure than the crystal interior  the remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup  about 60 percent solids by weight 
the sugar solution is clarified by the addition of
and   which combine to precipitate   the calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others  and then float to the top of the tank  where they can be skimmed off  an alternative to this  phosphatation  technique is     which is similar  but uses
and calcium hydroxide to produce a
precipitate 
after filtering any remaining solids  the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through  
or coal-based
is traditionally used in this role  some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon  the purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum  to produce   as in a sugar mill  the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging  additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from affination and again crystallizing to produce   when no more sugar can be economically recovered  the final molasses still contains 2030 percent sucrose and 1525 percent glucose and fructose 
to produce   in which individual grains do not clump  sugar must be dried  first by heating in a rotary dryer  and then by blowing cool air through it for several days 
ribbon cane syrup  
ribbon cane is a subtropical type that was once widely grown in the southern united states  as far north as coastal   the juice was extracted with horse or mule-powered crushers  the juice was boiled  like   in a flat pan  and then used in the syrup form as a food sweetener  it is not currently a commercial crop  but a few growers find ready sales for their product   
pollution from sugarcane processing  
particulate matter  combustion products  and volatile organic compounds are the primary pollutants emitted during the sugarcane processing  combustion products include nitrogen oxides  nox   carbon monoxide  co   co2  and sulfur oxides  sox   potential emission sources include the sugar granulators  sugar conveying and packaging equipment  bulk loadout operations  boilers  granular carbon and char regeneration kilns  regenerated adsorbent transport systems  kilns and handling equipment  at some facilities   carbonation tanks  multi-effect evaporator stations  and vacuum boiling pans  modern pollution prevention technologies are capable of addressing all of these potential pollutants

brazil led the world in sugarcane production in 2013 with a 739 267 tmt harvest  india was the second largest producer with 341 200 tmt tons  and china the third largest producer with 125 536 tmt tons harvest 
the average worldwide yield of sugarcane crops in 2013 was 70.77 tons per hectare  the most productive farms in the world were in
with a nationwide average sugarcane crop yield of 133.71 tons per hectare 
the theoretical possible yield for sugar cane  according to 1983 study of duke  is about 280 metric tons per hectare per year  and small experimental plots in brazil have demonstrated yields of 236280 metric tons of fresh cane per hectare  the most promising region for high yield sugarcane production were in sun drenched  irrigated farms of northern africa  and other deserts with plentiful water from river or irrigation canals 
in the united states  sugarcane is grown commercially in       and  
brazil uses sugarcane to produce sugar and
for gasoline-ethanol blends     a locally popular transportation   in   sugarcane is used to produce sugar 
and alcoholic beverages 
cane ethanol  
main article 
a fuel pump in brazil  offering cane ethanol  a  and gasoline  g  
ethanol is generally available as a byproduct of sugar production  it can be used as a
alternative to gasoline  and is widely used in cars in brazil  it is an alternative to gasoline  and may become the primary product of sugarcane processing  rather than sugar 
in brazil  gasoline is required to contain at least 22 percent bioethanol  this bioethanol is sourced from brazil s large sugarcane crop 
the production of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palm vegetable oils  particularly if cane bagasse is used to produce heat and power for the process  furthermore  if biofuels are used for crop production and transport  the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low  eia estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology  the well-to-wheels co2 emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline 
a textbook on renewable energy describes the energy transformation 
presently  75 tons of raw sugar cane are produced annually per hectare in brazil  the cane delivered to the processing plant is called burned and cropped  b c   and represents 77  of the mass of the raw cane  the reason for this reduction is that the stalks are separated from the leaves  which are burned and whose ashes are left in the field as fertilizer   and from the roots that remain in the ground to sprout for the next crop  average cane production is  therefore  58 tons of b c per hectare per year 
each ton of b c yields 740 kg of juice  135 kg of sucrose and 605 kg of water  and 260 kg of moist bagasse  130 kg of dry bagasse   since the lower heating value of sucrose is 16.5 m kg  and that of the bagasse is 19.2 mj kg  the total heating value of a ton of b c is 4.7 gj of which 2.2 gj come from the sucrose and 2.5 from the bagasse 
per hectare per year  the biomass produced corresponds to 0.27 tj  this is equivalent to 0.86 w per square meter  assuming an average insolation of 225 w per square meter  the photosynthetic efficiency of sugar cane is 0.38  
the 135 kg of sucrose found in 1 ton of b c are transformed into 70 litres of ethanol with a combustion energy of 1.7 gj  the practical sucrose-ethanol conversion efficiency is  therefore  76   compare with the theoretical 97   
one hectare of sugar cane yields 4,000 litres of ethanol per year  without any additional energy input  because the bagasse produced exceeds the amount needed to distill the final product   this  however  does not include the energy used in tilling  transportation  and so on  thus  the solar energy-to-ethanol conversion efficiency is 0.13  
bagasse applications  
sugarcane is a major crop in many countries  it is one of the plants with the highest bioconversion efficiency  sugarcane crop is able to efficiently fix solar energy  yielding some 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land annually  after harvest  the crop produces sugar juice and bagasse  the fibrous dry matter  this dry matter is biomass with potential as fuel for energy production  bagasse can also be used as an alternative source of pulp for paper production 
sugarcane bagasse is a potentially abundant source of energy for large producers of sugarcane  such as brazil  india and china  according to one report  with use of latest technologies  bagasse produced annually in brazil has the potential of meeting 20 percent of brazils energy consumption by 2020 
electricity production  
a number of countries  in particular those devoid of any fossil fuel  have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures to minimize energy used in cane processing and furthermore export any excess electricity to the grid  bagasse is usually burned to produce steam  which in turn creates electricity  current technologies  such as those in use in   produce over 100 kwh of electricity per tonne of bagasse  with a total world harvest of over 1 billion tonnes of sugar cane per year  the global energy potential from bagasse is over 100,000 gwh  using mauritius as a reference  an annual potential of 10,000 gwh of additional electricity could be produced throughout   electrical generation from bagasse could become quite important  particularly to the rural populations of sugarcane producing nations 
recent cogeneration technology plants are being designed to produce from 200 to over 300 kwh of electricity per tonne of bagasse  as sugarcane is a seasonal crop  shortly after harvest the supply of bagasse would peak  requiring power generation plants to strategically manage the storage of bagasse 
biogas production  
a greener alternative to burning bagasse for the production of electricity is to convert bagasse into   technologies are being developed to use
to transform bagasse into advanced
and biogas
