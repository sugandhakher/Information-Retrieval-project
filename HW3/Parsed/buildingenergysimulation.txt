building energy simulation  also called building energy modeling  or energy modeling in context   is the use of software to predict the energy use of a building 
contents
background  
a typical energy model will have inputs for climate  envelope  internal gains from lighting  equipment  and occupants  heating  cooling  and ventilation systems  schedules of occupants  equipment  and lighting  energy models will output building energy use predictions in typical end-use categories  heating  cooling  lighting  fan    process  in addition to energy units  most software includes utility rates input  and can predict energy costs 
energy-savings measures can be calculated using simple spreadsheets and a wide variety of bespoke software applications are available 
applications  
building design  many modern commercial or residential building codes require minimum energy performance  energy modeling can be used to demonstrate compliance  or predict energy consumption of proposed developments 
  comparing different building design alternatives to determine which is the least cost  including capital costs and  at a minimum  energy costs  sometimes referred to as total cost of ownership analysis 
energy retrofit analysis  in conjunction with an   or
an energy model can be used to predict savings associated to proposed energy cost measures  often called ecms  
accuracy of building simulation  
there are normally occurring   yezioro  dong and leite developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3  of mean absolute error
