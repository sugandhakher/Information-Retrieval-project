personal carbon trading
personal carbon trading is the generic term for a number of proposed
schemes under which emissions credits would be allocated to adult individuals on a  broadly  equal
basis  within national   individuals then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity  individuals wanting or needing to emit at a level above that permitted by their initial allocation would be able to purchase additional credits from those using less  creating a profit for those individuals who emit at a level below that permitted by their initial allocation

proposals  
current proposals include 
 teqs  - devised by environmental writer    who first published the idea in 1996 under its former name domestic tradable quotas  dtqs   the uk s
has been researching this scheme since 2003  and more recently the
 rsa  through its carbonlimited project  the scheme was the subject of a uk government pre-feasibility study in 2008  and an all party parliamentary group report in 2011 
personal carbon allowances  pcas  - described in the book  how we can save the planet  by
and tina fawcett  work on pcas is ongoing at the   oxford  uk  the title  pcas  or  pca scheme  is sometimes used generically to refer to any proposed form of personal carbon trading 
tradable personal pollution allowances - originally proposed in an article by dr  kirk barrett in 1995 and applicable to any form of pollution  including carbon dioxide 
end-user emissions trading - preliminary proposal in an article by suryapratim roy and edwin woerdman which analyses some of the legal and policy nuances of an emissions trading scheme for individuals  for instance on an eu-wide scale 
individuals would most likely hold their emissions credits in electronic accounts  and would surrender them when they make carbon-related purchases  such as electricity  heating fuel and petroleum  pcas could also require individuals to use credits for public transport 
would bring all other sectors of society  e g      within the scope of a single scheme 
individuals who exceed their allocation  i e  those who want to use more emissions credits than they have been given  would be able to purchase additional credits from those who use less  so individuals that are under allocation would profit from their small carbon footprint  there are two types of carbon credits  certified emission reduction credits euas and cers and verified carbon credits 
proponents of personal carbon trading claim that it is an equitable way of addressing
and   as it could guarantee that a national economy lives within its agreed carbon budget and ensure fair access to fuel and energy  they also believe it would increase carbon literacy among the public  while encouraging more localised economies 
personal carbon trading has been criticised for its possible complexity and high implementation costs  as yet  there is minimal reliable data on these issues  there is also the fear that personal  rationing  and trading of allowances will be politically unacceptable  especially if those allowances are used to buy from industries who are already passing on costs from their participation in carbon levy or trading schemes such as the    
research in this area has shown that personal carbon trading would be a
policy instrument - redistributing money from the rich to the poor - as the rich use more energy than the poor  and so would need to buy allowances from them  this is in contrast to a   under which all lower income people are worse off  prior to revenue redistribution 
progress towards implementation  
is trialling the world s first personal carbon trading programme  starting in 2011 
the
also grants powers allowing the uk government to introduce a personal carbon trading scheme without further primary legislation 
in may 2008
completed a pre-feasibility study into   with the headline finding that  personal carbon trading has potential to engage individuals in taking action to combat climate change  but is essentially ahead of its time and expected costs for implementation are high   based on this defra announced that  the  uk  government remains interested in the concept of personal carbon trading and  although it will not be continuing its research programme at this stage  it will monitor the wealth of research focusing on this area and may introduce personal carbon trading if the value of carbon savings and cost implications change  
later that same month the uk parliament s
produced their report on the subject  which concluded that personal carbon trading could be essential in helping to reduce our national carbon footprint  and rebuked the government for delaying a full feasibility study  stating that  although we commend the government for its intention to maintain engagement in academic work on the topic  we urge it to undertake a stronger role  leading and shaping debate and coordinating research  
analysts have noted that to implement any effective carbon rationing system   the government must convince the public that rationing levels are fair  that the system is administered transparently and fairly  and that evaders are few in number  likely to be detected and liable to stiff penalties if found guilty  
a 2010 paper into attitudes towards personal carbon trading suggests a general ambivalence  however the researchers noted that  in fact  moderate support was the commonest view   a 4-week consumer trial on personal carbon allowances carried out in london in june 2011 reported that  participants engaged with the personal carbon allowance concept with enthusiasm  
in january 2011  the uk s all party parliamentary group on peak oil published a report into teqs  garnering significant media coverage  this report highlights the significant research from a number of research centres produced since the government s pre-feasibility study  and argues that these studies demonstrate the benefits of to be far greater than was acknowledged in the government s research  accordingly  it urges them to move quickly to fund moves towards potential implementation in the near future
