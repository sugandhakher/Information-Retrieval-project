main article 
with 70 percent of the countrys power generation  hydropower is a very important national energy source  the total large hydropower potential for colombia is estimated at 93gw  with an additional 25gw of small hydropower   20mw 
wind  
the wind regime in colombia is among the best in south america  offshore regions of the northern part of colombia  such as in the   have been classified with class 7 winds  over 10 meters per second  m s    the only other region in latin america with such high
classification is the patagonia region of chile and argentina 
colombia has an estimated theoretical wind power potential of 21 gw just in the enough to generate sufficient power to meet the national demand almost twice over  however  the country only has an installed capacity of 19.5 mw of wind energy  tapping only 0.4  of its theoretical wind potential  this capacity is concentrated in a single project  the jeprachi wind project  developed by empresas pblicas de medelln  epm  under a
mechanism arranged by the   there are several projects under consideration  including a 200 mw project in ipapure

solar  
colombia has significant
resources because of its location in the equatorial zone  but the country sits in a complex region of the andes where climatic conditions vary  the daily average radiation is 4.5 kwh m2  and the area with the best solar resource is the   with 6 kwh m2 of radiation  of the 6 mw of solar power installed in colombia  equivalent to about 78,000 average-size solar panels   57 percent is distributed in rural applications and 43 percent in communication towers and road signaling  solar systems can be very suitable for applications in rural areas  where energy demands are dispersed and modest and grid connection is often more costly  upme 2005  
geothermal  
the former colombian institute of electrical energy  today ipse  and the latin american energy organization have identified three areas with
potential 
azufral  in   where the
volcano is located 
cerro negro-tufio  also in   near the chiles volcano  and
  located in the cordillera oriental in

biomass  
colombia has a great biomass power potential from agricultural residues  banana  coffee pulp  and animal waste   its annual biomass power potential is estimated to be over 16 gwh  which is still less than 0.1  of current electricity production  the potential is distributed as follows 
11,828 mwh yr from agriculture residues
2,640 mwh yr from bioethanol
698 mwh yr from natural forest residues
658 mwh yr from biodiesel
442 mwh yr from planted forest residues
the region of urab in the north of the department of
has approximately 19,000 hectares of banana plantations  producing more than 1 million tons annually  it has also been estimated that approximately 85,000 toe yr could be produced from the 190 million m3 yr of biogas generated from coffee plantations  equivalent to 995,000 mwh 
in addition  the landfills in the four main cities in colombia  bogot  medelln  cali  and barranquilla  are estimated to have the potential to provide for an installed capacity of 47 mw  0.3  of current installed capacity
