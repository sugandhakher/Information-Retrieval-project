etymology
the earliest recorded use of the term  industrial revolution  seems to have been in a letter from 6 july 1799 written by french envoy   announcing that france had entered the race to industrialise  in his 1976 book  
states in the entry for  industry    the idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in
and   between 1811 and 1818  and was implicit as early as
in the early 1790s and
at the turn of the  19th  century   the term industrial revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s  as in  s description in 1837 of la rvolution industrielle 
in
in 1844 spoke of  an industrial revolution  a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society   however  although engels wrote in the 1840s  his book was not translated into english until the late 1800s  and his expression did not enter everyday language until then  credit for popularising the term may be given to   whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term 
some historians  such as
and   have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer  this is still a subject of debate among historians 
important technological developments
the commencement of the industrial revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations  beginning in the second half of the 18th century  by the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies 
textiles  mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water greatly increased the output of a worker  the
increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40  the
increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50  large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen  but they were not as great as in cotton 
steam power  the efficiency of
increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel  the adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses  the high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio  making it suitable for transportation  steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800 
iron making  the substitution of
for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production  using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces  resulting in economies of scale  the cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760  it was later improved by making it double acting  which allowed higher furnace temperatures  the
produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the   the
was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron 
 1828  greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades 
textile manufacture
main article 
in the late 17th and early 18th centuries the british government passed a series of
in order to
the domestic woollen industry from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from its competitors in india 
the demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around
that produced   a cloth with flax
and cotton   flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength  but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100  cotton and was more difficult to sew 
on the eve of the industrial revolution  spinning and weaving were done in households  for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the   occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver  under the putting-out system  home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers  who often supplied the raw materials  in the off season the women  typically farmers  wives  did the spinning and the men did the weaving  using the   it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver  823 the
patented in 1733 by   with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747  doubled the output of a weaver  worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving  it became widely used around lancashire after 1760 when john s son    invented the drop box  82122
patented the roller
and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness  the technology was developed with the help of john wyatt of   paul and wyatt opened a mill in birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey  in 1743 a factory opened in
with 50 spindles on each of five of paul and wyatt s machines  this operated until about 1764  a similar mill was built by
in   but this burnt down  both lewis paul and daniel bourn patented
machines in 1748  based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds  it was later used in the first   lewis s invention was later developed and improved by
in his
and
in his  
model of the
in a museum in   invented by
in 1764  the spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution 
in 1764 in the village of stanhill  lancashire 
invented the   which he patented in 1770  it was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles  the jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel  by first clamping down on the fibres  then by drawing them out  followed by twisting  it was a simple  wooden framed machine that only cost about 6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792  and was used mainly by home spinners  the jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for   not   82527
the spinning frame or water frame was developed by richard arkwright who  along with two partners  patented it in 1769  the design was partly based on a spinning machine built for thomas high by clockmaker john kay  who was hired by arkwright  82730 for each spindle  the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers  each operating at a successively higher rotating speed  to draw out the fibre  which was then twisted by the spindle  the roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length  too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread  the top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight  the weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers  the bottom rollers were wood and metal  with fluting along the length  the water frame was able to produce a hard  medium count thread suitable for warp  finally allowing 100  cotton cloth to be made in britain  a horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame  arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in cromford  derbyshire in 1771  giving the invention its name 
the only surviving example of a
built by the inventor   the mule produced superior quality thread with minimal labour 
 s   introduced in 1779  was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame in which the spindles were placed on a carriage  which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating  832 crompton s mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost  mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp  and finally allowed britain to produce good quality calico cloth  832

realising that the expiration of the arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers  edmund cartwright developed a vertical
which he patented in 1785  in 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional  834 cartwright built two factories  the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers  cartwright s loom design had several flaws  the most serious being thread breakage  samuel horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813  horock s loom was improved by richard roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by roberts  hill   co 
the demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the southern united states  who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed 
responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive   with a cotton gin a man could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would have previously taken a woman working two months to process at one pound per day 
other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning  carding  twisting and spinning  and rolling  so that the supply of
increased greatly  this in turn fed a weaving industry that advanced with improvements to
and the loom or  frame   the output of an individual labourer increased dramatically  with the effect that the new machines threatened the bargaining power of the labourers  and early innovators were attacked and their inventions destroyed 
these advances were capitalised on by   of whom the best known is richard arkwright  he is credited with a list of inventions  but these were actually developed by such people as
and   arkwright nurtured the inventors  patented the ideas  financed the initiatives  and protected the machines  he created the
which brought the production processes together in a factory  and he developed the use of powerfirst horse power and then which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry  before long
was applied to drive textile machinery 
acquired the nickname
during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories 
metallurgy
the
could produce
using mined coal  the burning coal remained separate from the iron ore and so did not contaminate the iron with impurities like sulphur and ash  this opened the way to increased iron production 
    england
a major change in the metal industries during the era of the industrial revolution was the replacement of
and other bio-fuels with coal  for a given amount of heat  coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal  and coal was more abundant than wood 
use of coal in
started somewhat before the industrial revolution  based on innovations by sir
and others from 1678  using coal
known as cupolas  these were operated by the flames playing on the
and charcoal or
mixture 
the
to metal  this has the advantage that impurities  such as sulphur ash  in the coal do not migrate into the metal  this technology was applied to
from 1678 and to
from 1687  it was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s  but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace   the
is a different  and later  innovation  
this was followed by   who made great strides using coke to fuel his
at
in 1709  however  the coke
he made was used mostly for the production of
goods  such as pots and kettles  he had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots  cast by his patented process  were thinner and cheaper than theirs  coke pig iron was hardly used to produce
in forges until the mid-1750s  when his son
built
and
furnaces  not far from coalbrookdale   by then  coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron  since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful  it began being a structural material following the building of the innovative
in 1778 by  
wrought iron for smiths to forge into consumer goods was still made in   as it long had been  however  new processes were adopted in the ensuing years  the first is referred to today as   but this was superseded by  s
process  cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes 
in 1783 and
in 1784  rolling replaced hammering for consolidating wrought iron and expelling some of the dross  rolling was 15 times faster than hammering with a trip hammer  roller mills were first used for making sheets  but also were developed for rolling structural shapes such as angles and rails 
puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost  puddling was a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation  with iron ore as the oxygen source  as the iron was manually stirred using a long rod  the decarburized iron  having a higher melting point than cast iron  was raked into globs by the puddler  when the glob was large enough the puddler would remove it  puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work  few puddlers lived to be 40  puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace  allowing coal or coke to be used as fuel  the puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel  because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs  it was never successfully mechanised 
up to that time  british iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies  this came principally from sweden from the mid-17th century and later also from russia from the end of the 1720s  however  from 1785  imports decreased because of the new iron making technology  and britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured wrought iron  
  patented by
in 1828  was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron  by using waste exhaust heat to preheat combustion air  the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coal or two-thirds using coke  however  the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved  hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces  increasing their capacity  using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron  this meant that lower quality coal or
could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive  however  by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably 
two decades before the industrial revolution an improvement was made in the production of   which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do  such as for cutting edge tools and for springs 
developed his
technique in the 1740s  the raw material for this was blister steel  made by the  
the supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries  such as those making nails  hinges  wire and other hardware items  the development of
allowed better working of iron  causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries 
steam power
main article 
the 1698 savery engine  piston-less steam pump  the world s first commercially useful steam powered device  built by  
the development of the
was an important element of the industrial revolution  however  during the early period of the industrial revolution  the majority of industrial power was supplied by water and wind  in britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam  by 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000hp  small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread electrification in the early 20th century  these included  
powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery 
the first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to
in 1698  he constructed and patented in london a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump  that generated about one
 hp  and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines  hence its  brand name   the miner s friend   savery s pump was economical in small horsepower ranges  but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes  savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century 
the first successful piston steam engine was introduced by
before 1712  a number of newcomen engines were successfully put to use in britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines  with the engine on the surface  these were large machines  requiring a lot of capital to build  and produced about 5hp  3.7kw   they were extremely inefficient by modern standards  but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads  opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper  despite their disadvantages  newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century  by 1729  when newcomen died  his engines had spread  first  to hungary in 1722  germany  austria  and sweden  a total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired  of which 14 were abroad  in the 1770s the engineer
built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements  a total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800 
was the first practical piston steam engine  subsequent steam engines were to power the industrial revolution 
a fundamental change in working principles was brought about by
  in close collaboration with
  he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his   which incorporated a series of radical improvements  notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder thereby making the low pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere  use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber  the separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder  which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam  likewise  the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder  also improving efficiency  these improvements increased engine efficiency so that boulton   watts engines used only 2025  as much coal per horsepower-hour as newcomen s  boulton and watt opened the   for the manufacture of such engines  in 1795 
by 1783 the watt steam engine had been fully developed into a
rotative type  which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill  both of watt s basic engine types were commercially very successful  and by 1800  the firm
had constructed 496 engines  with 164 driving reciprocating pumps  24 serving   and 308 powering mill machinery  most of the engines generated from 5 to 10hp  7.5kw  
the development of   such as the engine   planing  milling and shaping machines powered by these engines  enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines 
until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the   built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house  but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines  readily removable  but not on wheels  were developed  such as the   around the start of the 19th century  the cornish engineer   and the american 
began to construct higher pressure non-condensing steam engines  exhausting against the atmosphere  high pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail

the industrial revolution created a demand for metal parts used in machinery  this led to the development of several machine tools for cutting metal parts  they have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms 
before the advent of machine tools  metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers  files  scrapers  saws and chisels  consequently  the use of metal was kept to a minimum  wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity  and the various joints tended to rack  work loose  over time  as the industrial revolution progressed  machines with metal parts and frames became more common  hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve  pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen built water and wind mills 
made wooden framing  and smiths and turners made metal parts 
the first large machine tool was the cylinder
used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines  the   the
and the
were developed in the early decades of the 19th century  although the milling machine was invented at this time  it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century 
  who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century  was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the     he was hired away by
for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship  bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe  maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe  which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw  before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs  some of which copied from a template  39295 the slide rest lathe was called one of history s most important inventions  although not entirely maudslay s idea  31  36
maudslay left bramah s employment and set up his own shop  he was engaged to build the machinery for making ships  pulley blocks for the
in the   these machines were all-metal and were the first machines for
and making components with a degree of   the lessons maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools  and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work  such as  
and  
of
had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century  as did
of leeds  roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement 
the impact of machine tools during the industrial revolution was not that great because other than firearms  threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts  in the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the
became the largest industrial sector of the economy  by value added  in the u s 
chemicals
the large scale production of
was an important development during the industrial revolution  the first of these was the production of

invented by the englishman
  s first partner  in 1746  he was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger  less expensive chambers made of
sheets of   instead of making a small amount each time  he was able to make around 100 pounds  50kg  in each of the chambers  at least a tenfold increase 
the production of an
on a large scale became an important goal as well  and
succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of   the
was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and   the
was heated with
   and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and   adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide  the process produced a large amount of pollution  the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air  and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product   nonetheless  this synthetic
proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants    or from   which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash  and also to
   derived from hardwood ashes 
these two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions  replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes  sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass  textile  soap  and
industries  early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling  removing rust  iron and steel  and for
cloth 
the development of bleaching powder    by scottish chemist
in about 1800  based on the discoveries of french chemist   revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required  from months to days  for the traditional process then in use  which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk  tennant s factory at st rollox  north   became the largest chemical plant in the world 
after 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in   and germany took world leadership  building a strong chemical industry  aspiring chemists flocked to german universities in the 18601914 era to learn the latest techniques  british scientists by contrast  lacked research universities and did not train advanced students  instead the practice was to hire german-trained chemists

gas lighting
main article 
another major industry of the later industrial revolution was   though others made a similar innovation elsewhere  the large-scale introduction of this was the work of   an employee of   the
pioneers  the process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces  the purification of the gas  removal of sulphur  ammonia  and heavy hydrocarbons   and its storage and distribution  the first gas lighting utilities were established in london between 1812 and 1820  they soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the uk  gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil  its introduction allowed night life to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before

to create sheet glass  they became the leading producers of window and plate glass  this advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption  thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings 
is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure 
paper machine
main article 
a machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by nicholas louis robert who worked for
family in france  the paper machine is known as a fourdrinier after the financiers  brothers sealy and   who were
in london  although greatly improved and with many variations  the fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today 
the method of
demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other
processes 
agriculture
main article 
the
is considered one of the causes of the industrial revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up workers to work in other sectors of the economy 
industrial technologies that affected farming included the   the   which contained iron parts  and the threshing machine 
invented an improved seed drill in 1701  it was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth  this was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five  tull s seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact  good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century 
joseph foljambe s rotherham
of 1730  was the first commercially successful iron plough  the   invented by
in 1784  displaced hand threshing with a   a laborious job that took about one-quarter of agricultural labour  286 it took several decades to diffuse and was the final straw for many farm labourers  who faced near starvation  leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the  
and metalworking techniques developed during the industrial revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment  such as reapers  binders and combine harvesters 
mining
in britain  particularly in
started early  before the steam engine 
were often shallow
following a seam of coal along the surface  which were abandoned as the coal was extracted  in other cases  if the geology was favourable  the coal was mined by means of an
or
driven into the side of a hill 
was done in some areas  but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water  it could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a
 a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine   in either case  the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity  the introduction of the steam pump by
in 1698 and the
in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper  enabling more coal to be extracted  these were developments that had begun before the industrial revolution  but the adoption of  s improvements to the newcomen engine followed by james watt s more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines  making mines more profitable 
coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of
in many coal seams  some degree of safety was provided by the
which was invented in 1816 by sir
and independently by   however  the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light  firedamp explosions continued  often setting off
  so casualties grew during the entire 19th century  conditions of work were very poor  with a high casualty rate from rock falls

at the beginning of the industrial revolution  inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads  with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea  wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment  but canals had not yet been widely constructed  animals supplied all of the motive power on land  with sails providing the motive power on the sea  the first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century  with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century 
the industrial revolution improved britain s transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network  a canal and waterway network  and a railway network  raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before  improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly 
canals
main article 
the   famous because of its commercial success  crossing the   one of the last canals to be built 
canals were the first technology to allow bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland  this was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart 
building of canals dates to ancient times  the
in china   the world s largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence   parts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries bc  is 1,121 miles  1,804km  long and links
with beijing

to the rapidly growing town of
its construction cost 168,000  22,589,130 as of 2013   but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761  the price of coal in manchester fell by about half  this success helped inspire a period of intense canal building  known as   new canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the bridgewater canal  the most notable being the

by the 1820s a national network was in existence  canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways  they were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on  the last major canal to be built in the united kingdom was the   which upon opening in 1894 was the largest
in the world  and opened manchester as a   however it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways  which were quicker and often cheaper 
britain s canal network  together with its surviving mill buildings  is one of the most enduring features of the early industrial revolution to be seen in britain 
roads

much of the original british road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes  but from the 1720s  and occasionally earlier 
trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads  increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in england and wales was the responsibility of a   new engineered roads were built by  
and most notably   with the first    stretch of road being marsh road at ashton gate  bristol in 1816  the major turnpikes radiated from london and were the means by which the royal mail was able to reach the rest of the country  heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow  broad wheeled  carts hauled by teams of horses  lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of   stage coaches carried the rich  and the less wealthy could pay to ride on  
railways

in 1830  the first inter-city railway in the world and which spawned
due to its success 
reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons  this was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at croydon  england 
 a good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds  or one ton  a party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment  that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration  twelve wagons were loaded with stones  till each wagon weighed three tons  and the wagons were fastened together  a horse was then attached  which drew the wagons with ease  six miles in two hours  having stopped four times  in order to show he had the power of starting  as well as drawing his great load 
railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive
after 1800  the
for making rails  and the development of the high pressure steam engine also around 1800 
wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal  these were all horse drawn or relied on gravity  with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline  the first applications of the steam
were on wagon or plate ways  as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used   horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs  see 
steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high pressure steam engines after the expiration of the
patent in 1800  high pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere  doing away with the condenser and cooling water  they were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines  a few of these early locomotives were used in mines  steam-hauled public railways began with the
in 1825 
the rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829   which demonstrated  s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of   which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the

construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first industrial revolution  after many of the workers had completed the railways  they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities  providing additional workers for the factories 
social effects
main article 
factory system
main article 
prior to the industrial revolution most of the workforce was employed in agriculture  either as self-employed farmers as land owners or tenants  or as landless agricultural labourers  by the time of the industrial revolution the
whereby farmers and townspeople produced goods in their homes  often described as cottage industry  was the standard  typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving  merchant capitalist provided the raw materials  typically paid workers by the   and were responsible for the sale of the goods  embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems  the logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system 
some early spinning and weaving machinery  such as a
for about six pounds in 1792  was affordable for cottagers  later machinery such as spinning frames 
and power looms were expensive  especially if water powered   giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories  many workers  who had nothing but their labour to sell  became factory workers out of necessity 
the change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by   however  he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology 
impact on women and family life
women s historians have debated the effect of the industrial revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women  taking a pessimistic side 
argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century england  it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance  clark argues that in 16th century england  women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture  the home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms  and in some trades and landed estates  their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands  however  clark argues  as capitalism expanded in the 17th century  there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home  and the wife reduced to unpaid household work  middle-class and women were confined to an idle domestic existence  supervising servants  lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs  capitalism  therefore  had a negative effect on powerful women 
in a more positive interpretation 
argues that capitalism created the conditions for women s emancipation  tilly and scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women  finding three stages in english history  in the pre-industrial era  production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households  the second stage was the  family wage economy  of early industrialisation  the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members  including husband  wife and older children  the third or modern stage is the  family consumer economy   in which the family is the site of consumption  and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption 
standards of living
the effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial  and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s  a series of 1950s essays by
and sheila v  hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population  that was at the bottom of the social ladder  suffered severe reductions in their living standards  during 18131913  there was a significant increase in worker wages 
some economists  such as   say that the real impact of the industrial revolution was that  for the first time in history  the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth    nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists  even as a theoretical possibility   others  however  argue that while growth of the economy s overall productive powers was unprecedented during the industrial revolution  living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries  and that in many ways workers  living standards declined under early capitalism  for instance  studies have shown that real wages in britain only increased 15  between the 1780s and 1850s  and that life expectancy in britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s 
food and nutrition
main article 
chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including britain and france  until the late 19th century  until about 1750  in large part due to malnutrition  life expectancy in france was about 35 years  and only slightly higher in britain  the united states population of the time was adequately fed  much taller on average and had life expectancy of 4550 years 
in britain and the netherlands  food supply had been increasing and prices falling before the industrial revolution due to better agricultural practices  however  population grew too  as noted by    before the industrial revolution  advances in agriculture or technology soon led to an increase in population  which again strained food and other resources  limiting increases in per capita income  this condition is called the   and it was finally overcome by industrialisation 
transportation improvements  such as canals and improved roads  also lowered food costs  railroads were introduced near the end of the industrial revolution 
housing
living conditions during the industrial revolution varied from splendour for factory owners to squalor for workers   
in
in 1844
described backstreet sections of manchester and other mill towns  where people lived in crude shanties and shacks  some not completely enclosed  some with dirt floors  these shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings  there were no sanitary facilities  population density was extremely high  eight to ten unrelated mill workers often shared a room  often with no furniture  and slept on a pile of straw or sawdust  toilet facilities were shared if they existed  disease spread through a contaminated water supply  also  people were at risk of developing pathologies due to persistent  
the famines that troubled rural areas did not happen in industrial areas  but urban peopleespecially small childrendied due to diseases spreading through the cramped living conditions 
 spread in congested dwellings   lung diseases from the mines 
from polluted water and typhoid were also common 
not everyone lived in such poor conditions  the industrial revolution also created a middle class of professionals  such as lawyers and doctors  who lived in much better conditions 
conditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage  hygiene and home construction  in the introduction of his 1892 edition  engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved 
clothing and consumer goods
consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils  and in the following decades  stoves for cooking and space heating 
population increase
according to robert hughes in the fatal shore  the
and wales  which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740  rose dramatically after 1740  the population of england had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and  by 1901  had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million  improved conditions led to the population of britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s  europe s population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900 
the industrial revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in population and in per capita income 
labour conditions
social structure and working conditions
in terms of social structure  the industrial revolution witnessed the triumph of a
of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry  ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories  but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines  as late as the year 1900  most industrial workers in the united states still worked a 10-hour day  12 hours in the steel industry   yet earned from 20  to 40  less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life  however  harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution took place 
was very static and often cruel  dirty living conditions  and long working hours were just as prevalent before the industrial revolution 
factories and urbanisation

industrialisation led to the creation of the   arguably the first highly mechanised was  s
at   operational by 1721  lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in italy and acting as an industrial spy  however  since the silk industry there was a closely guarded secret  the state of the industry there is unknown  because lombe s factory was not successful and there was no follow through  the rise of the modern factory dates to somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanised 
the factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas  as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories  nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of manchester  nicknamed     and the world s first industrial city  manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831  bradford grew by 50  every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50  of the population of bradford was actually born there 
for much of the 19th century  production was done in small mills  which were typically
and built to serve local needs  later  each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler 
the transition to industrialisation was not without difficulty  for example  a group of english workers known as
formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes
factories 
in other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive  some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers  one of the earliest such reformers was   known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the   and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the

child labour
a young  drawer  pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery  in britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions 
the industrial revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the industrial revolution  although infant mortality rates were reduced markedly  there was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work  employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable  there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine  and since the industrial system was completely new  there were no experienced adult labourers  this made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the industrial revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries  in england and scotland in 1788  two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered
were described as children 
existed before the industrial revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible  many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders  1020  of an adult male s wage  children as young as four were employed  beatings and long hours were common  with some child
and
working from 4 am until 5 pm  conditions were dangerous  with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts  while others died from gas explosions  many children developed
and other diseases and died before the age of 25 
would sell orphans and abandoned children as  pauper apprentices   working without wages for board and lodging  those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters  with some masters
them to prevent escape  children employed as
by
would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton  working 14 hours a day  six days a week  some lost hands or limbs  others were crushed under the machines  and some were decapitated  young girls worked at match factories  where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop   children employed at
were regularly burned and blinded  and those working at
were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust 
reports were written detailing some of the abuses  particularly in the coal mines and textile factories  and these helped to popularise the children s plight  the public outcry  especially among the upper and middle classes  helped stir change in the young workers  welfare 
politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted  some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid   and others simply welcomed the cheap labour  in 1833 and 1844  the first general laws against child labour  the   were passed in britain  children younger than nine were not allowed to work  children were not permitted to work at night  and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours  factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law  however  their scarcity made enforcement difficult  about ten years later  the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden  these laws decreased the number of child labourers  however child labour remained in europe and the united states up to the 20th century 
luddites
main article 
luddites smashing a power loom in 1812
the rapid industrialisation of the english economy cost many craft workers their jobs  the movement started first with
and
workers near
and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation  many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited  and unskilled  labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver  many such unemployed workers  weavers and others  turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery  these attackers became known as luddites  supposedly followers of   a folklore figure  the first attacks of the luddite movement began in 1811  the luddites rapidly gained popularity  and the british government took drastic measures  using the
or
to protect industry  those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged  or
for life 
unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised  such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern britain were affected by the
disturbances  threshing machines were a particular target  and
burning was a popular activity  however  the riots led to the first formation of   and further pressure for reform 
organisation of labour
see also 
the industrial revolution concentrated labour into mills  factories and mines  thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or
to help advance the interests of working people  the power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production  employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production  skilled workers were hard to replace  and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining 
the main method the unions used to effect change was   many strikes were painful events for both sides  the unions and the management  in britain  the
forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824  even after this  unions were still severely restricted 
in 1832  the
extended the vote in britain but did not grant universal suffrage  that year six men from
in dorset founded the friendly society of agricultural labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s  they refused to work for less than ten shillings a week  although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six  in 1834 james frampton  a local landowner  wrote to the prime minister    to complain about the union  invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other  which the members of the friendly society had done  james brine  james hammett  george loveless  george s brother james loveless  george s brother in-law thomas standfield  and thomas s son john standfield were arrested  found guilty  and transported to australia  they became known as the   in the 1830s and 1840s  the
movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice  its charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by parliament without consideration 
working people also formed
and
as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship  enlightened industrialists  such as
also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class 
unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike  in 1842  a
involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the chartist movement which stopped production across great britain 
eventually  effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who  after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885  began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the british  
impact on environment
levels of air pollution rose during the industrial revolution  sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century 
the origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of
in the atmosphere during the industrial revolution  the emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in
gave rise to an unprecedented level of
in industrial centers  after 1900 the large volume of industrial
discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste  the first large-scale  modern environmental laws came in the form of britain s   passed in 1863  to regulate the deleterious air pollution     given off by the   used to produce   an alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution  the responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded  culminating in the alkali order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted   grit  dust and fumes under supervision 
the manufactured gas industry began in british cities in 18121820  the technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers  the gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits  they usually lost and modified the worst practices  the city of london repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the thames and poisoning its fish  finally  parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity  the industry reached the us around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits 
in industrial cities local experts and reformers  especially after 1890  took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution  and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms  typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution  the
was formed in britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental ngos  it was founded by artist sir   frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke  although there were earlier pieces of legislation  the
required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke  it also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke  the provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the smoke abatement act to include other emissions  such as soot  ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations 
other effects
the application of steam power to the industrial processes of
supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing  which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation 
during the industrial revolution  the
of children increased dramatically  the percentage of the children born in london who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5  in 17301749 to 31.8  in 18101829 
the growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive
and the rise of new great cities  first in europe and then in other regions  as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas  in 1800  only 3  of the world s population lived in cities  compared to nearly 50  today  the beginning of the 21st century   manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717  but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million 
industrialisation beyond the united kingdom
continental europe
held that the industrial revolution began in britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s  while
held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830  the industrial revolution on
came a little later than in great britain  in many industries  this involved the application of technology developed in britain in new places  often the technology was purchased from britain or british engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities  by 1809  part of the
in westphalia was called  miniature england  because of its similarities to the industrial areas of england  the german  russian and belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries  in some cases  such as    the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the british technology were adopted 
belgium
was the second country  after britain  in which the industrial revolution took place and the first in continental europe 
 french speaking southern belgium  was the first region to follow the british model successfully  starting in the middle of the 1820s  and especially after belgium became an independent nation in 1830  numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around
and   the leader was a transplanted englishman   his factories at
integrated all stages of production  from engineering to the supply of raw materials  as early as 1825 
wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion  thanks to coal  the french word  houille  was coined in wallonia   the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after britain  but it is also pointed out by many researchers  with its    especially in the  
and
valleys  between the
and         there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making      philippe raxhon wrote about the period after 1830   it was not propaganda but a reality the walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after britain    the sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of walloon was the old cloth making town of    michel de coster  professor at the
wrote also   the historians and the economists say that belgium was the second industrial power of the world  in proportion to its population and its territory       but this rank is the one of wallonia where the coal-mines  the blast furnaces  the iron and zinc factories  the wool industry  the glass industry  the weapons industry    were concentrated  
demographic effects
wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape  at the left  the sillon industriel  which runs from
in the west  to
in the east  except part of north flanders  in another period of the industrial revolution  after 1920   even if belgium is the second industrial country after britain  the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different  in  breaking stereotypes   muriel neven and isabelle devious say 
the industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one  but with a strong contrast between northern and southern belgium  during the
and the early modern period  flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres       at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region  flanders   with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent  remained one of the most urbanised in the world  by comparison  this proportion reached only 17 per cent in wallonia  barely 10 per cent in most west european countries  16 per cent in france and 25 per cent in britain  nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure  except in
      also  in
the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process  even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910  especially in the  
and
valleys  between the
and   where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making  urbanisation was fast  during these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred  concentrating nearly half of the walloon population in this region  nevertheless  industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres  but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory  communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than  for instance  the area around lige where the old town was there to direct migratory flows

sweden
main article 
during the period 17901815 sweden experienced two parallel economic movements  an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates  new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming  and a protoindustrialisation  with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter  this led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the 1820s 
during 18151850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries  this period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in   textile mills in sjuhradsbygden and forestry in   several important institutional changes took place in this period  such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842  as first country in the world   the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846  and a stock company law in 1848 
during 18501890  sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export  dominated by crops  wood and steel  sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873

in 1787  the first cotton mill in america  the largest cotton mill of its era  and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future  this mill was designed to use horse power  but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable  and had economic losses for years  despite the losses  the manufactory served as a playground of innovation  both in turning a large amount of cotton  but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in slater s mill

main articles 
and
the industrial revolution began about 1870 as
leaders decided to catch up with the west  the government built railroads  improved roads  and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development  it inaugurated a new western-based education system for all young people  sent thousands of students to the united states and europe  and hired more than 3,000 westerners to teach modern science  mathematics  technology  and foreign languages in japan    
in 1871  a group of japanese politicians known as the
toured europe and the united states to learn western ways  the result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable japan to quickly catch up  the   founded in 1882  used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories  education was expanded and japanese students were sent to study in the west 
modern industry first appeared in textiles  including cotton and especially silk  which was based in home workshops in rural areas 
second industrial revolution
main article 
is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production  which are said to characterise a  second industrial revolution   beginning around 1850  although a method for mass manufacture of
was not invented until the 1860s  when
invented a new furnace which could convert molten
into steel in large quantities  however  it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality  bessemer steel was being displaced by the
near the end of the 19th century 
this second industrial revolution gradually grew to include chemicals  mainly the  
 refining and distribution   and  in the 20th century  the   and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from britain to the united states and germany 
the increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation 
a new revolution began with electricity and
in the   the introduction of
generation in the
enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern italy  beginning in the 1890s 
by the 1890s  industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests  as companies like    
and
joined the railroad and ship companies on the world s  
opposition from romanticism
main article 
during the industrial revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed  associated with the romantic movement  romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization  urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes  its major exponents in english included the artist and poet
and poets      
and   the movement stressed the importance of  nature  in art and language  in contrast to  monstrous  machines and factories  the  dark satanic mills  of blake s poem      s novel
reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged  french romanticisim likewise was highly critical of industry 
causes
regional
per capita changed very little for most of human history before the industrial revolution 
the causes of the industrial revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate  with some historians believing the revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of
in
after the
in the 17th century  the
movement and the
made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive  forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into   for example   and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed   the
of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade  creation of
and accumulation of
are also cited as factors  as is the
of the 17th century 
until the 1980s  it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the industrial revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine  however  recent research into the
has challenged the traditional  supply-oriented interpretation of the industrial revolution 
has proposed that the industrial revolution had its origins in the   much earlier than most estimates  he explains that the model for standardised
was the
and that  the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock   he also cites the
emphasis on order and time-keeping  as well as the fact that
cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later  more physical  manifestations such as the steam engine 
the presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the industrial revolution  particularly explaining why it occurred in britain  in other nations  such as france  markets were split up by local regions  which often imposed tolls and
on goods traded among them  internal tariffs were abolished by   they survived in russia till 1753  1789 in france and 1839 in spain 
governments  grant of limited
to inventors under a developing
system  the
in 1623  is considered an influential factor  the effects of patents  both good and ill  on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine  the key enabling technology  in return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as james watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines  thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development  however  monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance  or even overbalance  the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors  watt s monopoly may have prevented other inventors  such as  
or   from introducing improved steam engines  thereby retarding the industrial revolution by about 16 years 
causes in europe
main article 
one question of active interest to historians is why the industrial revolution occurred in europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century  particularly china    and the middle east  or at other times like in
or the   numerous factors have been suggested  including education  technological changes  see
in europe    modern  government   modern  work attitudes  ecology  and culture  however  most historians contest the assertion that europe and china were roughly equal because modern estimates of per capita income on western europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in
 and britain had a
of nearly 2,000 dollars  whereas china  by comparison  had only 450 dollars 
some historians such as
and
credit the different belief systems in asia and europe with dictating where the revolution occurred  the religion and beliefs of europe were largely products of
and
thought  conversely  chinese society was founded on men like    
   
    and
    resulting in very different worldviews  other factors include the considerable distance of china s coal deposits  though large  from its cities as well as the then unnavigable
that connects these deposits to the sea 
regarding india  the marxist historian
said   the capital to finance the industrial revolution in india instead went into financing the industrial revolution in britain   in contrast to china  india was split up into many competing kingdoms  with the three major ones being the  
and the   in addition  the economy was highly dependent on two sectorsagriculture of subsistence and cotton  and there appears to have been little technical innovation  it is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the british take over 
causes in britain
as the industrial revolution developed british manufactured output surged ahead of other economies  after the industrial revolution  it was overtaken later by the united states 
great britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled
to pioneer the industrial revolution  key factors fostering this environment were   1  the period of peace and stability which followed the unification of england and scotland   2  no trade barriers between england and scotland   3  the rule of law  respecting the sanctity of contracts    4  a straightforward legal system which allowed the formation of joint-stock companies  corporations   and  5  a free market  capitalism  
geographical and natural resource advantages of great britain were the fact that it had extensive coast lines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in europe 
there were two main values that really drove the industrial revolution in britain  these values were self-interest and an entrepreneurial spirit  because of these interests  many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth  these advancements also greatly benefitted the british society as a whole  countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in britain and use them as an example to begin their own industrial revolutions 
the debate about the start of the industrial revolution also concerns the massive lead that great britain had over other countries  some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that britain received from its many overseas
or that profits from the british
between africa and the caribbean helped fuel industrial investment  however  it has been pointed out that slave trade and west indian plantations provided only 5  of the british national income during the years of the industrial revolution  even though slavery accounted for so little  caribbean-based demand accounted for 12  of britain s industrial output 
instead  the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies  particularly china and russia  britain emerged from the
as the only european nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse  and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size  european merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the    britain s extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods  the conflict resulted in most british warfare being conducted overseas  reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of europe  this was further aided by britain s geographical positionan island separated from the rest of mainland europe 
another theory is that britain was able to succeed in the industrial revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed  it had a dense population for its small geographical size 
of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available  there was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the   the  
and the   local supplies of coal  iron  lead  copper  tin  limestone and water power  resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry  also  the damp  mild weather conditions of the north west of england provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton  providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry 
the stable political situation in britain from around 1688  and british society s greater receptiveness to change  compared with other european countries  can also be said to be factors favouring the industrial revolution  peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the enclosure movement  and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism   this point is also made in  s   
britain s population grew 280  15501820  while the rest of western europe grew 5080   seventy percent of european urbanisation happened in britain 17501800  by 1800  only the netherlands was more urbanised than britain  this was only possible because coal  coke  imported cotton  brick and slate had replaced wood  charcoal  flax  peat and thatch  the latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not  yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse s work was mechanised  a workhorse needs 3 to 5 acres  1.21 to 2.02  for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy 
in 1700  5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in britain  while the netherlands had none  so despite having europe s best transport  most urbanised  well paid  literate people and lowest taxes  it failed to industrialise  in the 18th century  it was the only european country whose cities and population shrank  without coal  britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s 
transfer of knowledge
knowledge of innovation was spread by several means  workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached  a common method was for someone to make a study tour  gathering information where he could  during the whole of the industrial revolution and for the century before  all european countries and america engaged in study-touring  some nations  like sweden and france  even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy  in other countries  notably britain and america  this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods  study tours were common then  as now  as was the keeping of travel diaries  records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods 
another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies  like the   in which members met to discuss  natural philosophy   i e  science  and often its application to manufacturing  the lunar society flourished from 1765 to 1809  and it has been said of them   they were  if you like  the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions  the industrial revolution   other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions  for example  the london-based
published an illustrated volume of new inventions  as well as papers about them in its annual transactions 
there were publications describing technology 
such as  s
 1704  and  s
 18021819  contain much of value  cyclopaedia contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the industrial revolution  very well illustrated by fine engravings  foreign printed sources such as the
and diderot s
explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates 
periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century  and many regularly included notice of the latest patents  foreign periodicals  such as the annales des mines  published accounts of travels made by french engineers who observed british methods on study tours 
protestant work ethic
main article 
another theory is that the british advance was due to the presence of an
class which believed in progress  technology and hard work  the existence of this class is often linked to the
 see   and the particular status of the
and the dissenting protestant sects  such as the
and
that had flourished with the   reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law  which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in britain in the
of 1688  and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the
by the   contributed to the capacity for  and interest in  private financial investment in industrial ventures 
found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices  as well as education at england s
at the time  although dissenters were still free to study at scotland s    when the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official
became mandatory due to the   they thereupon became active in banking  manufacturing and education  the   in particular  were very involved in education  by running dissenting academies  where  in contrast to the universities of oxford and cambridge and schools such as eton and harrow  much attention was given to mathematics and the sciencesareas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies 
historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important  along with the nature of the national economies involved  while members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government  they were considered fellow protestants  to a limited extent  by many in the   such as traditional financiers or other businessmen  given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital  the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century
