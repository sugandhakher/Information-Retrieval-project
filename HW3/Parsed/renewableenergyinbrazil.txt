government support  
brazil s first wind-energy
was installed in
in 1992  ten years later the government created the program for incentive of alternative electric energy sources  proinfa  to encourage the use of other   such as wind power  biomass  and small hydroelectric power stations  pchs   such stations use hydropower  the flagship of brazil s energy matrix  which comprises around three-quarters of brazil s installed energy capacity 
high energy production costs  coupled with the advantages of wind power as a renewable  widely available energy source  have led several countries to establish regulatory incentives and direct financial investments to stimulate wind power generation 
growth of wind energy  
since the inception of proinfa  brazil s wind energy production has escalated from 22 mw in 2003 to 602 mw in 2009  as part of 36 private projects  another 10 projects are under construction  with a capacity of 256.4 mw  and 45 additional projects have been approved by aneel with an estimated potential of 2,139.7 mw 
developing these wind power sources in brazil is helping the country to meet its strategic objectives of enhancing   reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating jobs  the potential for this type of power generation in brazil could reach up to 145,000 mw  according to the 2001 brazilian wind power potential report by the electric energy research centre  cepel  
cost  
the
continues to pose a significant challenge to the growth of wind energy  the price per megawatt hour  mwh  established in brazil s auction of wind power reserve supply is r 189  while the cap defined in bidding for power plants of the
hydroelectricity complex was r 91  uhe jirau  in 2008  and r 122  uhe santo antonio  in 2007  these hydroelectricity prices were marked down by up to 35  in the 2008 and 2007 auctions  the energy supply was negotiated at r 71.4 mwh in the case of jirau  and r 78.9 mwh for the santo antonio plant

the total installed photovoltaic power capacity in brazil is estimated to be between 12 and 15 mwp  of which 50  is for telecommunications systems and 50  for rural energy systems  it is less than 0.01  of the energy in brazil

and favourable climate 
most cars on the road today in brazil can run on blends of up to 25  ethanol  and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends  most car makers in brazil sell
cars  trucks  and minivans that can use
and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 100  ethanol  e100   in 2009  90  of cars produced that year ran on  
brazil is the second largest producer of ethanol in the world and is the largest
of the fuel  in 2008  brazil produced 454,000 bbl d of ethanol  up from 365,000 in 2007  all gasoline in brazil contains ethanol  with blending levels varying from 20-25   over half of all cars in the country are of the flex-fuel variety  meaning that they can run on 100 percent ethanol or an ethanol-gasoline mixture  according to anp  brazil also produced about 20,000 bbl d of
in 2008  and the agency has enacted a three-percent blending requirement for domestic diesel sales 
the importance of ethanol in brazil s domestic transportation fuels market will only increase in the future  according to   ethanol accounts for more than 50 percent of current light vehicle fuel demand  and the company expects this to increase to over 80  by 2020  because ethanol production continues to grow faster than domestic demand  brazil has sought to increase ethanol exports  according to industry sources  brazil s ethanol exports reached 86,000 bbl d in 2008  with 13,000 bbl d going to the   brazil is the largest ethanol exporter in the world  holding over 90  of the global export market 
hydrogen  
the center of management and strategic studies under the supervision of the brazilian ministry of science and technology has published a document titled  energetic hydrogen in brazil  funding for competitive politics 20102025  hidrogenio energetico no brasil  subsidios para polticas de competitividade 20102025 in portuguese   giving numbers of a hydrogen scenario in the country related to its research  technologies and funding  45   the document reports brazil as a leader in latin america but yet with an investment in hydrogen technologies of only 3 to 5  of japan  european union  or the united states  national hydrogen production is about 920,000 t  10.2 billion cubic meters  per year with only 1  used as a direct fuel and the other 99  for refining  petrochemical  fertilizers and methanol 
biomass

energy 
in the state of   remains of the tree are reused for biomass power generation 
is a clean energy source used in brazil  it reduces environmental pollution as it uses organic garbage 
remains 
shaving or vegetal oil  refuse cane  with its high energetic value  has been used to produce electricity  more than 1 million people in the country works in the production of biomass  and this energy represents 27  of brazil s energetic matrix 
the recent interest in converting biomass to electricity comes not only from its potential as a low-cost  indigenous supply of power  but for its potential environmental and developmental benefits  for example  biomass may be a globally important mitigation option to reduce the rate of co2 buildup by sequestering carbon and by displacing fossil fuels  renewably grown biomass contributes only a very small amount of
to the   locally  plantations can lessen soil erosion  provide a means to restore degraded lands  offset emissions and local impacts from fossil-fired power generation  and  perhaps  reduce demands on existing forests  in addition to the direct power and environmental benefits  biomass energy systems offer numerous other benefits  especially for   such as brazil  some of these benefits include the employment of underutilized labor and the production of co- and by-products  for example  fuelwood 
nearly all of the experience with biomass for power generation is based on the use of
and residue fuels  primarily wood wood wastes and agricultural residues   the production of electric power from
grown wood is an emerging technology with considerable promise  however  actual commercial use of plantation-grown fuels for power generation is limited to a few isolated experiences  wood from plantations is not an inexpensive energy   and as long as worldwide prices of coal  oil and gas are relatively low  the establishment of plantations dedicated to supplying electric power or other higher forms of energy will occur only where financial
or incentives exist or where other sources of energy are not available 
the biomass plantations are supplying energy on a commercial basis  such as in brazil  the
and   it can be shown that a combination of government policies and or high conventional energy prices have stimulated the use of short-rotation plantations for energy  brazil used tax incentives beginning in the mid-1960s to initiate a reforestation program to provide for industrial wood energy and wood product needs  as a consequence of the brazilian forestry code with its favourable tax incentives  the planted forest area in brazil increased from 470,000ha to 6.5 million ha by 1993  with the discontinuation of the tax incentives in 1988  plantation establishment in brazil has slowed although the commercial feasibility of using
for energy and other products has been clearly demonstrated
