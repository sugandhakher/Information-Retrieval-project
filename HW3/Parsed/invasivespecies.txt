an invasive species is a     or
that is not native to a specific location  an    and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment  human economy or human health     
one study pointed out widely divergent perceptions of the criteria for invasive species among researchers  p 135  and concerns with the subjectivity of the term  invasive   p 136   some of the alternate usages of the term are below 
the term as most often used applies to introduced species  also called  non-indigenous  or  non-native   that adversely affect the
and
they invade economically  environmentally  or ecologically  such invasive species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by dominating a region    particular   or
land from loss of natural controls  such as

organizations as well as conservation groups such as the

 pueraria lobata  
 cortaderia jubata   and
 centaurea solstitialis  are examples 
an alternate usage broadens the term to include indigenous or  native  species along with non-native species  that have colonized natural areas  p 136

regions of the united states   
sometimes the term is used to describe a non-native or

causes  
scientists include species- and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that when combined  establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species 
species-based mechanisms  
while all species compete to survive  invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete   in some cases  the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction  in other cases  species interact with each other more directly 
researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers  one study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species  86  of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone  another study found invasive species tended to have only a small subset of the presumed traits and that many similar traits were found in noninvasive species  requiring other explanations  common invasive species traits include the following 
fast growth
rapid
high
ability
 the ability to alter growth form to suit current conditions 
tolerance of a wide range of environmental conditions   
ability to live off of a wide range of food types   
association with humans
prior successful invasions
typically  an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location  at low population densities  it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location  so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established  repeated patterns of human movement  such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment  also known as a high   
an introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as   light  physical space  water  or food  if these species evolved under great
or   then the new environment may host fewer able competitors  allowing the invader to proliferate quickly  ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as
systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native  however  such
competitive superiority  and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader  is not the rule  invasive species often coexist with native species for an extended time  and gradually  the superior competitive ability of an invasive species becomes apparent as its population grows larger and denser and it adapts to its new location 
growing in abandoned
 
 
an invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species  such as deep water sources accessed by a long   or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types  for example  barbed goatgrass    was introduced to
on   which have low water-retention  low nutrient levels  a high   ratio  and possible
toxicity  plant populations on these soils tend to show low density  but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils 
invasive species might alters its environment by releasing chemical compounds  modifying
factors  or affecting the behaviour of herbivores  creating a positive or negative impact on other species  some species  like   produce   that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species  other species like
the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development 
another examples are
 yellow starthistle  and centaurea diffusa     these
have spread through the
and   experiments show that   a chemical produced at the root of c  diffusa  has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it  such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses  c  diffusa and c  solstitialis do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors  success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others  conversely  examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness 
changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation    originally from eurasia  is highly fire-adapted  it not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity  heat  of fires by providing large amounts of dry
during the fire season in western north america  in areas where it is widespread  it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires  allowing b  tectorum to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range 
facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species  for example 
increase habitat complexity on lake floors  providing crevices in which
live  this increase in complexity  together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel   increases the density and diversity of
invertebrate communities 
ecosystem-based mechanisms  
in   the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem  in stable ecosystems  equilibrium exists in the use of available resources  these mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance  which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem 
when changes such as a
occur  normal succession favors native
and   an introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species  squeezing them out 
and
are often the limiting factors in these situations 
every species occupies a
in its native ecosystem  some species fill large and varied roles  while others are highly specialized  some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species  and they also can create new niches    an example of this type can be found within the
species of skink 
ecosystem changes can alter species  distributions  for example 
describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture  the boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat  creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat   
one interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments  when bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation  the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance  this conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution  following invasion events  selection may initially act on the capacity to disperse as well as physiological tolerance to the new stressors in the environment  adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment  these responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change  or the presence of native species whether it be predator or prey  adaptations include changes in morphology  physiology  phenology  and plasticity 
rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment  intraspecific phenotypic plasticity  pre-adaptation and post-introduction evolution are all major factors in adaptive evolution  plasticity in populations allows room for changes to better suit the individual in its environment  this is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced  the ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness  pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species  if the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced  it is more likely to fare better in the new environment  this  in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction  all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive 
ecology  
traits of invaded ecosystems  
in 1958  charles s  elton claimed that ecosystems with higher
were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches  other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse  but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion 
this debate hinged on the
at which invasion studies were performed  and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011  small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion  while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse  the latter result may be a side-effect of invasives  ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered 
the
 boiga irregularis 
invasion was more likely in ecosystems that were similar to the one in which the potential invader evolved  island ecosystems may be more prone to invasion because their species faced few strong competitors and predators  or because their distance from colonizing species populations makes them more likely to have  open  niches  an example of this phenomenon was the decimation of native bird populations on
by the invasive     conversely  invaded ecosystems may lack the natural competitors and predators that check invasives  growth in their native ecosystems 
invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance  typically human-induced  such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem 
vectors  
non-native species have many   including biogenic vectors  but most invasions are associated with human activity  natural
extensions are common in many species  but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions  and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces 
an early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the
 rattus exulans  to polynesia 
 eriocheir sinensis 
vectors include plants or seeds imported for   the
moves animals across borders  where they can escape and become invasive  organisms stow away on transport vehicles 
taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions 
around the world on the average day  more than 3,000 different species of aquatic life may be transported on these vessels  for example  freshwater   native to the  
and   probably reached the
via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel  although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988  and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter  the plan had  and continued to have as of 2005  a serious flaw or loophole  whereby ships that are loaded with cargo when they reach the
need not be tested  but all the same they transfer ballast  puddles  between seaway ports 
the arrival of invasive
to a new site is a function of the site s invasibility 
species have also been introduced intentionally  for example  to feel more  at home   american colonists formed  acclimation societies  that repeatedly imported birds that were native to europe to north america and other distant lands  in 2008  u s  postal workers in pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from taiwan  the box contained more than two dozen live beetles 
entomologists identified them as     and   because these species were not native to the u s   they could have threatened native ecosystems  to prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the u s   special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries 
programs such as
 sitc  attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in america 
economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction  high demand for the valuable
is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters   
impacts of wildfire  
invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem    roads  foot trails  to colonize an area  large wildfires can sterilize soils  while adding a variety of nutrients  in the resulting free-for-all  formerly entrenched species lose their advantage  leaving more room for invasives  in such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage  non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation  leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout 
impact of wildfire suppression on spreading  
wildfires often occur in remote areas  needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site  the crews can bring invasive seeds with them  if any of these stowaway seeds become established  a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks  after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread  also  disturbing the soil surface  such as cutting firebreaks  destroys native cover  exposes soil  and can accelerate invasions  in suburban and
areas  the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for
can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species   
fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks  as the vehicles are often driven on back roads often overgrown with invasive plant species  the undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport  in response  on large fires  washing stations  decontaminate  vehicles before engaging in suppression activities    large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places  further increasing the potential for seed transport   
effects  
an
attacking a   the
is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species  including the alligator
ecological  
land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species  disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems  changing ecosystem functions  a species of wetland plant known as aeae in hawaii  the indigenous   is regarded as a pest species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered hawaiian stilt     making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds 
multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects  the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish  examples of this are the introductions of the
 gemma gemma  and the european green crab     the gem clam was introduced into california s
from the east coast of the united states a century ago  it had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species  nutricola spp    in the mid-1990s  the introduction of the european green crab  found to prey preferentially on the native clams  resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations 
in the
region of   cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original   resulting in a massive reduction in
for native bovids and other grazers  since the 1970s  large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species  partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region  examples of these species are      
and  
invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems  for example  invasive plants can alter the fire regimen  cheatgrass     nutrient cycling  smooth cordgrass    and hydrology    in native ecosystems  invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have the potential to hybridize with the native species  harmful effects of hybridization have led to a decline and even extinction of native species  for example  hybridization with introduced cordgrass  spartina alterniflora  threatens the existence of california cordgrass    in san francisco bay  invasive species cause competition for native species and because of this 400 of the 958 endangered species under the endangered species act are at risk
geomorphological  
primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection  for example  kudzu   a vine native to asia was widely introduced in the southeastern usa in the early 20th century to control soil erosion  while primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation  bioerosion  and bioconstruction  for example  invasion of chinese mitten crab
have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates 
economic  
economic opportunities  
some invasions offer potential commercial benefits  for instance 
and
can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product  or processed into   or
feed 
can be turned into fuel by   and other invasive plants can also be harvested and utilized as a source of  
benefits  
non-native species can have benefits    for example  filter water pollutants better than native   oysters  they also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives  biologists are currently considering releasing this
in the
to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution  a recent study by the
found the asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay s deteriorating water quality  additionally  some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment  for example    shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in north america  has become an important pollinator of
as well as     and blueberry bushes 
invasivorism  
invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco-system  in response  invasivorism is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control  reduce  or eliminate their populations  chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients 
of  
created the first invasive species menu in the world  skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new placesuch as the indo-pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the western atlantic  caribbean and gulf of mexicoeradication is almost impossible  critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely 
a dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at fish fish of miami  florida
proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for  pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction - such as the
bird  the   and the   proponents of invasivorism also point to the success that jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of
by encouraging the consumption of the fish 
costs  
economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry  and management costs  estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the u s  alone amount to more than  138billion annually  economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues  when economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs  they are low because they do not consider environmental damage  if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species  loss in biodiversity  and loss of   costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase  the following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions 
plant industry  
weeds reduce yield in agriculture  though they may provide essential nutrients  some deep-rooted weeds can  mine  nutrients  see   from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil  while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species  many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material  many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants  threaten young cattle  e g   leafy spurge    or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines  e g      forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly 1billion in the u s  alone  a decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by
infected by the invasive   introduced rats   and   have become serious pests on farms  destroying stored grains 
invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock  citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive asian citrus psyllid  acp   because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops  citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where acp has been found

the asian long-horned beetle    was first introduced into the u s  in 1996  and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees  as of 2005 thirty million dollars had been spent in attempts to eradicate this pest and protect millions of trees in the affected regions  the

tourism and recreation  
invasive species can impact outdoor recreation  such as fishing  hunting  hiking  wildlife viewing  and water-based activities  they can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation  including  but not limited to  water quality and quantity  plant and animal diversity  and species abundance  eiswerth states   very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions  states  and watersheds   eurasian watermilfoil    in parts of the us  fill lakes with plants complicating fishing and boating  the very loud call of the introduced

encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as
to the wider population  introduced birds  e g  pigeons   rodents and insects  e g  mosquito  flea  louse and
pests  can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions  the introduced chinese mitten crabs are carriers of   throughout recorded history  epidemics of human diseases  such as       and   spread via these vectors  a recent example of an introduced disease is the spread of the   which killed humans  birds  mammals  and reptiles  waterborne disease agents  such as
bacteria     and causative agents of

biodiversity  
main article 
biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global biodiversity loss and is increasing because of tourism and     this may be particularly true in inadequately regulated
systems  though
and
rules have improved the situation 
invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via
exclusion 
displacement  or
with related native species  therefore  besides their economic ramifications  alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure  composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction  leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the worlds fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity  nevertheless  it is difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion  and the few scientific studies that have done so have been with animal taxa  concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence  either ecological or economic   in relation to the potential risk

while the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology  the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of
and
where the issue of biological invasions is especially important  much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by
1958 book the ecology of invasion by animals and plants which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions  studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day  this research  which has largely consisted of field observational studies  has disproportionately been concerned with   the rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events  despite this  little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as  invasion ecology  or more generally  invasion biology   this lack of standard terminology is a significant problem  and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture  zoology  and pathology  as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another 
in an attempt to avoid the ambiguous  subjective  and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers  colautti and macisaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on
rather than on  
by discarding taxonomy  human health  and economic factors  this model focused only on ecological factors  the model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species  it classified each population based on its success in that environment  this model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species  and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful
