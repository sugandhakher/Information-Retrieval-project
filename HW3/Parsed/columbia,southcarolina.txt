early history  
at the time of european encounter  the inhabitants of the area that became columbia were a people called the   in may 1540  a spanish expedition led by
traversed what is now columbia while moving northward  the expedition produced the earliest written historical records of the area  which was part of the regional
chiefdom 
from the creation of columbia by the
in 1786  the site of columbia was important to the overall development of the state  the congarees  a frontier fort on the west bank of the   was the head of navigation in the
system  a ferry was established by the colonial government in 1754 to connect the fort with the growing settlements on the higher ground on the east bank 
like many other significant early settlements in colonial america  columbia is on the

state senator
of the town of
introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on march 22  1786  to create a new state capital  there was considerable argument over the name for the new city  according to published accounts  senator gervais said he hoped that  in this town we should find refuge under the wings of    for that was the name which he wished it to be called  one legislator insisted on the name  washington   but  columbia  won by a vote of 117 in the state senate 
the   c  1796  is the oldest in columbia 
the site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786  due to its central location in the state  the state legislature first met there in 1790  after remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence  columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854 
columbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to
by the   this canal connected the santee and cooper rivers in a 22-mile-long  35km  section  it was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800  making it one of the earliest canals in the united states  with increased railroad traffic  it ceased operation around 1850 
the commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a 2-mile  3km  square along the river  the blocks were divided into lots of 0.5 acres  2,000m2  and sold to speculators and prospective residents  buyers had to build a house at least 30 feet  9.1m  long and 18 feet  5.5m  wide within three years or face an annual 5  penalty  the perimeter streets and two through streets were 150 feet  46m  wide  the remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares 100 feet  30m  wide  the width was determined by the belief that dangerous and pesky
could not fly more than 60 feet  18m  without dying of starvation along the way  columbians still enjoy most of the magnificent network of wide streets 
from the 15th floor of the main and gervais tower
the commissioners comprised the local government until 1797 when a commission of streets and markets was created by the general assembly  three main issues occupied most of their time  public drunkenness  gambling  and poor sanitation 
as one of the first
in the united states  columbia began to grow rapidly  its population was nearing 1,000 shortly after the start of the 19th century

in 1801  south carolina college  now the   was founded in columbia  the original building survives  the city was chosen as the site of the institution in part to unite the citizens of the
and the
and to discourage the youth from migrating to england for their higher education  at the time  south carolina sent more young men to england than did any other state  the leaders of south carolina wished to monitor the progress and development of the school  for many years after the founding of the university  commencement exercises were held in december while the state legislature was in session 
columbia received its first charter as a town in 1805  an intendant and six wardens would govern the town  john taylor  the first elected intendant  later served in both houses of the general assembly  both houses of congress  and eventually as governor  by 1816  there were 250 homes in the town and a population of more than one thousand  columbia became chartered as a city in 1854  with an elected mayor and six aldermen  two years later  columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen  the city continued to grow at a rapid pace  and throughout the 1850s and 1860s columbia was the largest inland city in the carolinas  railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in columbia during this time  rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales  not passengers  cotton was the lifeblood of the columbia community  in 1850 virtually all of the city s commercial and economic activity was related to cotton 
 in 1830  approximately 1,500
lived and worked in columbia  this population grew to 3,300 by 1860  some members of this large enslaved population worked in their masters  households  masters also frequently hired out slaves to columbia residents and institutions  including south carolina college  hired-out slaves sometimes returned to their owner s home daily  others boarded with their temporary masters   during this period   legislators developed state and local statutes to restrict the movement of urban slaves in hopes of preventing rebellion  although various decrees established
and prohibited slaves from meeting and from learning to read and write  such rulings were difficult to enforce   indeed   several prewar accounts note that many columbia slaves were literate  some slaves even conducted classes to teach others to read and write   as well   many slaves attended services at local baptist  presbyterian  and methodist churches  yet some struggled to obtain membership in these institutions  
columbia s
hosted the south carolina secession convention on december 17  1860  the delegates drafted a resolution in favor of   1590  columbia s location made it an ideal location for other conventions and meetings within  
the burning of columbia during  s occupation  from
on february 17  1865  in the last months of the civil war  much of columbia was
while being occupied by
troops under the command of general   jeff goodwyn  mayor of columbia  sent william b  stanley and thomas w  radcliffe to surrender the city to sherman s troops  according to legend  columbia s first baptist church barely missed being torched by sherman s troops  the soldiers marched up to the church and asked the sexton if he could direct them to the first baptist church  the sexton directed the men to the nearby washington street methodist church  thus  the historic landmark was saved from destruction by union soldiers  and the sexton preserved his employment at the cost of another 
equestrian statue in columbia of general and later
  known for his opposition to
controversy surrounding the burning of the city started soon after the war ended  general sherman blamed the high winds and retreating confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton  which had been stacked in the streets  general sherman denied ordering the burning  though he did order militarily significant structures  such as the confederate printing plant  destroyed  firsthand accounts by local residents  union soldiers  and a newspaper reporter offer a tale of revenge by union troops for columbia s and south carolina s pivotal role in leading southern states to secede from the   still other accounts portray it as mostly the fault of the confederacy    today  tourists can follow the path general sherman s army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire 
during   columbia became the focus of considerable attention  reporters  journalists  travelers  and tourists flocked to south carolina s capital city to witness a southern state legislature whose members included former slaves  the city also made somewhat of a rebound following the devastating fire of 1865  a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of reconstruction  and repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created jobs for area citizens 
following reconstruction  the columbia music festival association  cmfa  was established in 1897  by mayor william mcb  sloan and the aldermen of the city of columbia  it was headquartered in the opera house on main street  which was also city hall  its role was to book and manage concerts and events in the opera house for the city   
20th century  
the first few years of the 20th century saw columbia emerge as a regional textile manufacturing center  in 1907  columbia had six mills in operation        capital city  columbia  and palmetto  combined  they employed over 3,400 workers with an annual payroll of  819,000  giving the
an economic boost of over  4.8 million  columbia had no paved streets until 1908  when 17 blocks of main street were surfaced  there were  however  115 publicly maintained street crossings at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks  as an experiment  washington street was once paved with wooden blocks  this proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains  the blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925 
the years 1911 and 1912 were something of a construction boom for columbia  with  2.5 million worth of construction occurring in the city  these projects included the union bank building at main and gervais  the   a shopping arcade  and large hotels at main and laurel  the jefferson  and at main and wheat  the gresham   in 1917  the city was selected as the site of   a u s  military installation which was officially classified as a  field artillery replacement depot   the first recruits arrived at the camp on september 1  1917 
in 1930  columbia was the hub of a trading area with approximately 500,000 potential customers  it had 803 retail establishments  280 of them being food stores  there were also 58 clothing and apparel outlets  57 restaurants and lunch rooms  55 filling stations  38 pharmacies  20 furniture stores  19 auto dealers  11 shoe stores  nine cigar stands  five department stores and one book store  wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119  with one-third of them dealing in food 
in 1934  the federal courthouse at the corner of main and laurel streets was purchased by the city for use as city hall  built of granite from nearby  
is listed on the   designed by alfred built millet  president  s federal architect  the building was completed in 1876  millet  best known for his design of the executive office building in washington  d c   had originally designed the building with a clock tower  large cost overruns probably caused it to be left out  copies of mullet s original drawings can be seen on the walls of city hall alongside historic photos of columbia s beginnings  federal offices were moved to the  
reactivated camp jackson became
in 1940  giving the military installation the permanence desired by city leaders at the time  the fort was annexed into the city in the fall of 1968  with approval from   in the early 1940s  shortly after the attacks on pearl harbor which began america s involvement in   lt  colonel
and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the
over tokyo at what is now   they trained in
bombers  the same model as the plane that now rests at columbia s
in the
hangar 
the area s population continued to grow during the 1950s  having experienced a 40 percent increase from 186,844 to 260,828  with 97,433 people residing within the city limits of columbia 
the 1940s saw the beginning of efforts to reverse
and
in columbia  in 1945  a federal judge ruled that the city s black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts  however  in years following  the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials  other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned
and
 particularly regarding public schools   on august 21  1962  eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time  the
admitted its first black students in 1963  around the same time  many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city  blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions  and a non-discriminatory hiring policy was adopted by the city  these and other such signs of racial progress helped earn the city the 1964
for the second time  the first being in 1951   and a 1965 article in
magazine lauded columbia as a city that had  liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal   
historic preservation has played a significant part in shaping columbia into the city that it is today  the historic
was restored in 1967  which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures such as the
and homes associated with president       and noted free black celia mann  in the early 1970s  the university of south carolina initiated the refurbishment of its  horseshoe   several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time  among them the fort jackson museum  the mckissick museum on the campus of the university of south carolina  and most notably the   which opened in 1988 
mayor kirkman finlay  jr   was the driving force behind the refurbishment of seaboard park  now known as   in the historic congaree vista district  as well as the compilation of the  60 million palmetto center package  which gave columbia an office tower  parking garage  and the columbia marriott  which opened in 1983  the year 1980 saw the columbia metropolitan population reach 410,088  and in 1990 this figure had hit approximately 470,000

geography and climate  
photograph of columbia taken from the
one of columbia s more prominent geographical features is its   the boundary between the upland
and the   across which rivers drop as falls or rapids  columbia grew up at the fall line of the congaree river  which is formed by the convergence of the
and the   the congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation  the energy of falling water also powered columbia s early   the city has capitalized on this location which includes three rivers by christening itself  the columbia riverbanks region   columbia is located roughly halfway between the atlantic ocean and the
and sits at an elevation of around 292ft  89m  
soils in columbia are well drained in most cases  with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil  the subsoil may be yellowish red sandy clay loam  orangeburg series   yellowish brown sandy clay loam  norfolk series   or strong brown sandy clay  marlboro series   all belong to the
soil order

columbia has a
  cfa   with mild winters  early springs  warm autumns  and very hot and humid summers  the area averages 53 nights below freezing  but extended cold or days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing are both rare  with an annual average of 5.4 days with 100f  38c   and 77 days with 90f  32c   temperatures  the city s current promotional slogan describes columbia as  famously hot   precipitation  at 44.6 inches  1,130mm  annually  peaks in the summer months  and is the least during spring and fall  snowfall averages 1.5 inches  3.8cm   but many years receive no snowfall  like much of the southeastern u s   the city is prone to   which trap ozone and other pollutants over the area 
official extremes in temperature have ranged from 109f  43c  on
