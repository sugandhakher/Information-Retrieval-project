etymology  
the word petroleum comes from     petra  for rocks and     elaion  for oil  the term was found  in the spelling  petraoleum   in 10th-century old english sources  it was used in the treatise   published in 1546 by the german mineralogist   also known as georgius agricola  in the 19th century  the term petroleum was often used to refer to mineral oils produced by distillation from mined organic solids such as
 and later    and refined oils produced from them  in the united kingdom  storage  and later transport  of these oils were regulated by a series of petroleum acts  from the petroleum act 1863 onwards  petroleum 
history

early history  
oil derrick in   1922
petroleum  in one form or another  has been used since ancient times  and is now important across society  including in economy  politics and technology  the rise in importance was due to the invention of the   the rise in   and the importance of petroleum to industrial organic chemistry  particularly the synthesis of plastics  fertilizers  solvents  adhesives and pesticides 
more than 4000 years ago  according to
and  
was used in the construction of the walls and towers of   there were oil pits near
 near babylon   and a pitch spring on   great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river   one of the tributaries of the   ancient
indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society  by 347 ad  oil was produced from bamboo-drilled wells in china  early british explorers to
documented a flourishing oil extraction industry based in
that  in 1795  had hundreds of hand-dug wells under production  the mythological origins of the oil fields at   and its hereditary monopoly control by 24 families  indicate very ancient origins 
 pitch fountain  is said to be the first european site where petroleum has been explored and used  the still active erdpechquelle  a spring where petroleum appears mixed with water has been used since 1498  e g  for medical purposes  oil sands have been mined since the 18th century 
in
in lower saxony  natural asphalt bitumen has been explored since the 18th century 
both in pechelbronn as in wietze  the coal industry dominated the petroleum technologies 
modern history  
scottish chemist james young noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the
at  
from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil  at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery  in 1848 young set up a small business refining the crude oil 
young eventually succeeded  by distilling
at a low heat  in creating a fluid resembling petroleum  which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products  young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it  one of which he named  paraffine oil  because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax 
the production of these oils and solid
from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 october 1850  in 1850 young   meldrum and edward william binney entered into partnership under the title of e w  binney   co  at
in
and e  meldrum   co  at glasgow  their works at bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works in the world with the first modern oil refinery  using oil extracted from locally mined   shale  and bituminous coal to manufacture
and lubricating oils  paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold until 1856 
shale bings near   3 of a total of 19 in
the world s first oil refinery was built in 1856 by   his achievements also included the discovery of how to distill kerosene from seep oil  the invention of the modern kerosene lamp  1853   the introduction of the first modern street lamp in europe  1853   and the construction of the world s first modern oil well  1854  
the demand for petroleum as a fuel for lighting in north america and around the world quickly grew   s
near titusville  pennsylvania  is popularly considered the first modern well  already 1858
had found a significant amount of petroleum while drilling for
1858 in   germany  wietze later provided about 80  of the german consumption in the wilhelminian era  the production stopped in 1963  but wietze has hosted a petroleum museum since 1970 
drake s well is probably singled out because it was drilled  not dug  because it used a steam engine  because there was a company associated with it  and because it touched off a major boom  however  there was considerable activity before drake in various parts of the world in the mid-19th century  a group directed by major alexeyev of the bakinskii corps of mining engineers hand-drilled a well in the baku region in 1848  there were engine-drilled wells in west virginia in the same year as drake s well  an early commercial well was hand dug in
in 1853  and another in nearby
in 1857  at around the same time the world s first  small  oil refinery was opened at
in poland  with a larger one opened at
in romania shortly after  romania is the first country in the world to have had its annual crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics  275 tonnes for 1857 
the

 then    businessman
dug several wells between 1855 and 1858 before discovering a rich reserve of oil four metres below ground  williams extracted 1.5 million litres of crude oil by 1860  refining much of it into kerosene lamp oil  williams s well became commercially viable a year before drake s pennsylvania operation and could be argued to be the first commercial oil well in north america  the discovery at oil springs touched off an
which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area  advances in drilling continued into 1862 when local driller shaw reached a depth of 62 metres using the spring-pole drilling method  on january 16  1862  after an explosion of natural gas canada s first oil gusher came into production  shooting into the air at a recorded rate of 3,000 barrels per day  by the end of the 19th century the russian empire  particularly the
company in   had taken the lead in production 
access to oil was and still is a major factor in several military conflicts of the twentieth century  including   during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were   the
included the goal to capture the   as it would provide much needed oil-supplies for the german military which was suffering from blockades  oil exploration in north america during the early 20th century later led to the us becoming the leading producer by mid-century  as petroleum production in the us peaked during the 1960s  however  the united states was surpassed by saudi arabia and the soviet union 
today  about 90 percent of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil  petroleum also makes up 40 percent of total energy consumption in the united states  but is responsible for only 1 percent of electricity generation    petroleum s worth as a portable  dense energy source powering the vast majority of vehicles and as the base of many industrial chemicals makes it one of the world s most important   viability of the oil commodity is controlled by several key parameters  number of vehicles in the world competing for fuel  quantity of oil exported to the world market    
 economically useful energy provided minus energy consumed   political stability of oil exporting nations and ability to defend oil supply lines 
the top three oil producing countries are russia 
and the united states  about 80 percent of the world s readily accessible reserves are located in the middle east  with 62.5 percent coming from the arab 5       
and   a large portion of the world s total oil exists as unconventional sources  such as
in
and
in   while significant volumes of oil are extracted from oil sands  particularly in canada  logistical and technical hurdles remain  as oil extraction requires large amounts of heat and water  making its net energy content quite low relative to conventional crude oil  thus  canada s oil sands are not expected to provide more than a few million barrels per day in the foreseeable future 
composition  
in its strictest sense  petroleum includes only crude oil  but in common usage it includes all liquid  gaseous and solid   under surface   lighter hydrocarbons    
and
occur as gases  while
and heavier hydrocarbons are in the form of liquids or solids  however  in an underground
the proportions of gas  liquid  and solid depend on subsurface conditions and on the
of the petroleum mixture 
an

in it  because the pressure is lower at the surface than underground  some of the gas will come out of
and be recovered  or burned  as associated gas or solution gas  a
produces predominantly natural gas  however  because the underground temperature and pressure are higher than at the surface  the gas may contain heavier hydrocarbons such as pentane    and
in the   at surface conditions these will
out of the gas to form   often shortened to condensate  condensate resembles gasoline in appearance and is similar in composition to some
 
the proportion of light hydrocarbons in the petroleum mixture varies greatly among different   ranging from as much as 97 percent by weight in the lighter oils to as little as 50 percent in the heavier oils and  
the hydrocarbons in crude oil are mostly  
and various   while the other organic compounds contain  
and   and trace amounts of metals such as iron  nickel  copper and   many oil reservoirs contain live bacteria  the exact molecular composition of crude oil varies widely from formation to formation but the proportion of

crude oil varies greatly in appearance depending on its composition  it is usually black or dark brown  although it may be yellowish  reddish  or even greenish   in the reservoir it is usually found in association with natural gas  which being lighter forms a  gas cap  over the petroleum  and
which  being heavier than most forms of crude oil  generally sinks beneath it  crude oil may also be found in a semi-solid form mixed with sand and water  as in the
in canada  where it is usually referred to as crude   in canada  bitumen is considered a sticky  black  tar-like form of crude oil which is so thick and heavy that it must be heated or diluted before it will flow  venezuela also has large amounts of oil in the   although the hydrocarbons trapped in them are more fluid than in canada and are usually called   these oil sands resources are called
to distinguish them from oil which can be extracted using traditional oil well methods  between them  canada and
contain an estimated 3.6 trillion barrels  57010 9m3  of bitumen and extra-heavy oil  about twice the volume of the world s reserves of conventional oil 
petroleum is used mostly  by volume  for producing
and gasoline  both important    sources  84 percent by volume of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into energy-rich fuels  petroleum-based fuels   including gasoline  diesel  jet  heating  and other fuel oils  and   the lighter grades of crude oil produce the best yields of these products  but as the world s reserves of light and medium oil are depleted 
are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen  and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required  because heavier crude oils have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen  these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules  and using
to convert the longer  more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter  simpler ones in the fuels 
due to its high   easy transportability and   oil has become the world s most important source of energy since the mid-1950s  petroleum is also the raw material for many
products  including         and plastics  the 16 percent not used for energy production is converted into these other materials  petroleum is found in
in the upper
of some areas of the  s   there is also petroleum in   known
are typically estimated at around 190km3  1.2
  without oil sands  or 595km3  3.74 trillion barrels  with oil sands  consumption is currently around 84 million barrels  13.410 6m3  per day  or 4.9km3 per year  yielding a remaining oil supply of only about 120 years  if current demand remains static

petroleum is a mixture of a very large number of different   the most commonly found molecules are
 paraffins  
      or more complicated chemicals like   each petroleum variety has a unique mix of   which define its physical and chemical properties  like color and  
the alkanes  also known as paraffins  are
hydrocarbons with straight or branched chains which contain only
and
and have the general formula cnh2n 2  they generally have from 5 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule  although trace amounts of shorter or longer molecules may be present in the mixture 
the alkanes from
 c5h12  to
 c8h18  are
into gasoline  the ones from
 c9h20  to
 c16h34  into  
and   alkanes with more than 16 carbon atoms can be refined into
and   at the heavier end of the range 
is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms  while
has 35 and up  although these are usually
by modern refineries into more valuable products  the shortest molecules  those with four or fewer carbon atoms  are in a gaseous state at room temperature  they are the petroleum gases  depending on demand and the cost of recovery  these gases are either   sold as
under pressure  or used to power the refinery s own burners  during the winter  butane  c4h10   is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates  because its high vapor pressure assists with cold starts  liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric  it is best known for powering cigarette lighters  but it is also a main fuel source for many developing countries  propane can be liquified under modest pressure  and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy  from cooking to heating to transportation 
the cycloalkanes  also known as naphthenes  are saturated hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula cnh2n  cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points 
the aromatic hydrocarbons are
which have one or more planar six-carbon rings called   to which hydrogen atoms are attached with the formula cnh2n-6  they tend to burn with a sooty flame  and many have a sweet aroma  some are  
these different molecules are separated by
at an oil refinery to produce gasoline  jet fuel  kerosene  and other hydrocarbons  for example 
 isooctane   widely used in gasoline  has a chemical formula of c8h18 and it reacts with oxygen

petroleum is a
derived from ancient
  such as
and   vast quantities of these remains settled to sea or lake bottoms  mixing with sediments and being buried under   as further layers settled to the sea or lake bed  intense heat and pressure build up in the lower regions  this process caused the organic matter to change  first into a waxy material known as   which is found in various
around the world  and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons via a process known as   formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon
in a variety of mainly
reactions at high temperature and or pressure 
there were certain warm nutrient-rich environments such as the
and the ancient
where the large amounts of organic material falling to the ocean floor exceeded the rate at which it could decompose  this resulted in large masses of organic material being buried under subsequent deposits such as shale formed from mud  this massive organic deposit later became heated and transformed under pressure into oil 
geologists often refer to the temperature range in which oil forms as an  oil window below the minimum temperature oil remains trapped in the form of kerogen  and above the maximum temperature the oil is converted to natural gas through the process of   sometimes  oil formed at extreme depths may migrate and become trapped at a much shallower level  the

and
reservoir rock for it to accumulate in  and a cap rock  seal  or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface  within these reservoirs  fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake with a layer of water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it  although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs  because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water  they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks  known as   by impermeable rocks above  however  the process is influenced by underground water flows  causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir  when hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap  an

the reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions  where hydrocarbons are broken down to oil and natural gas by a set of parallel reactions  and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions  the latter set is regularly used in
plants and  
wells are drilled into oil reservoirs to extract the crude oil   natural lift  production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped  in some reservoirs  such as in the middle east  the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time  the natural pressure in most reservoirs  however  eventually dissipates  then the oil must be extracted using    means  over time  these  primary  methods become less effective and  secondary  production methods may be used  a common secondary method is
or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or  wellbore   eventually  tertiary  or  enhanced  oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil s flow characteristics by injecting steam  carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir  in the united states  primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis  secondary methods account for about half  and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent  extracting oil  or  bitumen   from oil tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort  or using  in-situ  methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping out the oil-saturated liquid

oil that has escaped to the surface 
are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded  but they contain so much migrating oil that  although most of it has escaped  vast amounts are still presentmore than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs  the lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first  resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil  called crude bitumen in canada  or extra-heavy crude oil in   these two countries have the world s largest deposits of oil sands 
on the other hand 
are source rocks that have not been exposed to heat or pressure long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil  technically speaking  oil shales are not always shales and do not contain oil  but are fined-grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called   the kerogen in the rock can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure to simulate natural processes  the method has been known for centuries and was patented in 1694 under british crown patent no  330 covering   a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch  tar  and oil out of a sort of stone   although oil shales are found in many countries  the united states has the world s largest deposits

 an oil industry measure of density   and its sulfur content  crude oil may be considered
if it has low density or
if it has high density  and it may be referred to as
if it contains relatively little sulfur or
if it contains substantial amounts of sulfur 
the geographic location is important because it affects transportation costs to the refinery  light crude oil is more desirable than heavy oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline  while sweet oil commands a higher price than sour oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries  each crude oil has unique molecular characteristics which are revealed by the use of

1 peak production of conventional oil already passed in this state
2 although canada s conventional oil production is declining  its total oil production is increasing as oil sands production grows  when oil sands are included  canada has the world s second largest oil reserves after saudi arabia 
3 though still a member  iraq has not been included in production figures since 1998
4 trinidad and tobago has the worlds third largest pitch lake situated la brea south trinidad
in 2013  the united states will produce an average of 11.4 million barrels a day  which would make it the second largest producer of hydrocarbons  and is expected to overtake saudi arabia before 2020

seawater acidification
is the increase in the acidity of the earth s oceans caused by the uptake of

when burned  petroleum releases carbon dioxide  a   along with the burning of coal  petroleum combustion may be the largest contributor to the increase in atmospheric co2    atmospheric co2 has risen over the last 150 years to current levels of over 390  from the
this rise in temperature may have reduced the

oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land  since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin

around the spill site before most of the oil escapes  and land animals can avoid the oil more easily 
control of oil spills is difficult  requires ad hoc methods  and often a large amount of manpower  the dropping of bombs and incendiary devices from aircraft on the
wreck produced poor results  modern techniques would include pumping the oil from the wreck  like in the

though crude oil is predominantly composed of various hydrocarbons  certain nitrogen heterocylic compounds  such as     and
are reported as contaminants associated with crude oil  as well as facilities processing oil shale or coal  and have also been found at legacy
sites  these compounds have a very high water solubility  and thus tend to dissolve and move with water  certain naturally occurring bacteria  such as     and
have been shown to degrade these contaminants 
tarballs  
a tarball is a blob of crude oil  not to be confused with   which is a man-made product derived from pine trees or refined from petroleum  which has been weathered after floating in the ocean  tarballs are an aquatic
in most environments  although they can occur naturally  for example in the santa barbara channel of california or in the gulf of mexico off texas  their concentration and features have been used to assess the extent of   their composition can be used to identify their sources of origin  and tarballs themselves may be dispersed over long distances by deep sea currents  they are slowly decomposed by bacteria  including

believes that the oecd countries will push low consumption policies at some point in the future  when that happens  it will definitely curb oil sales  and both opec and
kept lowering their 2020 consumption estimates during the past 5 years  oil products are more and more in competition with alternative sources  mainly coal and natural gas  both cheaper sources  production will also face an increasingly complex situation  while opec countries still have large reserves at low production prices  newly found reservoirs often lead to higher prices  offshore giants such as   guara and
demand high investments and ever-increasing technological abilities  subsalt reservoirs such as tupi were unknown in the twentieth century  mainly because the industry was unable to probe them 
 eor  techniques  example    china   will continue to play a major role in increasing the world s recoverable oil  the reach of available petroleum ressources has always been around 35 years or even less since the start of the modern exploration  the   a insider pun in the german industry refers to that effect 
peak oil  
main article 
global peak oil forecast
peak oil is the projection that future petroleum production  whether for individual oil wells  entire oil fields  whole countries  or worldwide production  will eventually peak and then decline at a similar rate to the rate of increase before the peak as these reserves are exhausted  the peak of oil discoveries was in 1965  and oil production per year has surpassed oil discoveries every year since 1980  however  this does not mean that potential oil production has surpassed oil demand 
applied his theory to accurately predict the peak of u s  conventional oil production at a date between 1966 and 1970  this prediction was based on data available at the time of his publication in 1956  in the same paper  hubbert predicts world peak oil in  half a century  after his publication  which would be 2006 
it is difficult to predict the oil peak in any given region  due to the lack of knowledge and or transparency in accounting of global oil reserves  based on available production data  proponents have previously predicted the peak for the world to be in years 1989  1995  or 19952000  some of these predictions date from before the recession of the early 1980s  and the consequent reduction in global consumption  the effect of which was to delay the date of any peak by several years  just as the 1971 u s  peak in oil production was only clearly recognized after the fact  a peak in world production will be difficult to discern until production clearly drops off  the peak is also a moving target as it is now measured as  liquids   which includes synthetic fuels  instead of just conventional oil 
the
 iea  said in 2010 that production of conventional crude oil had peaked in 2006 at 70 mbbl d  then flattened at 68 or 69 thereafter  since virtually all economic sectors rely heavily on petroleum    if it were to occur  could lead to a  partial or complete failure of markets   in the mid-2000s  widespread fears of an imminent peak led to the  peak oil movement   in which over one hundred thousand americans prepared  individually and collectively  for the  post-carbon  future 
unconventional production  
the calculus for peak oil has changed with the introduction of unconventional production methods  in particular  the combination of
and
has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays  analysts expect that  150 billion will be spent on further developing north american tight oil fields in 2015  the large increase in tight oil production is one of the reasons behind the price drop in late 2014  certain rock
contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective  conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons  horizontal drilling  extending horizontally through the strata  permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata  hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore
