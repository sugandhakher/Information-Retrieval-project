a fuel cell is a device that converts the
from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction of positively charged hydrogen ions with oxygen or another   fuel cells are different from
in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen or air to sustain the chemical reaction  whereas in a battery the chemicals present in the battery react with each other to generate an
 emf   fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as these inputs are supplied 
the first fuel cells were invented in 1838  the first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later in
space programs to generate power for
and   since then  fuel cells have been used in many other applications  fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial  industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas  they are also used to power   including forklifts  automobiles  buses  boats  motorcycles and submarines 
there are many types of fuel cells  but they all consist of an   a   and an
that allows positively charged hydrogen ions  or protons  to move between the two sides of the fuel cell  the anode and cathode contain catalysts that cause the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate positively charged hydrogen ions and electrons  the hydrogen ions are drawn through the electrolyte after the reaction  at the same time  electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit  producing
electricity  at the cathode  hydrogen ions  electrons  and oxygen react to form water  as the main difference among fuel cell types is the electrolyte  fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for
 pem fuel cells  or pemfc  to 10 minutes for
 sofc   individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials  about 0.7 volts  so cells are  stacked   or placed in series  to create sufficient voltage to meet an application s requirements  in addition to electricity  fuel cells produce water  heat and  depending on the fuel source  very small amounts of
and other emissions  the energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 4060   or up to 85  efficient in
if waste heat is captured for use 
the fuel cell market is growing  and in 2013 pike research estimated that the stationary fuel cell market will reach 50 gw by 2020

sketch of william grove s 1839 fuel cell
the first references to hydrogen fuel cells appeared in 1838  in a letter dated october 1838 but published in the december 1838 edition of the london and edinburgh philosophical magazine and journal of science  welsh physicist and barrister
wrote about the development of his first crude fuel cells  he used a combination of sheet iron  copper and porcelain plates  and a solution of sulphate of copper and dilute acid  in a letter to the same publication written in december 1838 but published in june 1839  german physicist
discussed the first crude fuel cell that he had invented  his letter discussed current generated from hydrogen and oxygen dissolved in water  grove later sketched his design  in 1842  in the same journal  the fuel cell he made used similar materials to today s   9 
in 1939  british engineer
successfully developed a 5kw stationary fuel cell  in 1955  w  thomas grubb  a chemist working for the general electric company     further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte  three years later another ge chemist  leonard niedrach  devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane  which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions  this became known as the  grubb-niedrach fuel cell   ge went on to develop this technology with nasa and mcdonnell aircraft  leading to its use during   this was the first commercial use of a fuel cell  in 1959  a team led by harry ihrig built a 15kw fuel cell tractor for   which was demonstrated across the u s  at state fairs  this system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and
and oxygen as the reactants  later in 1959  bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine  in the 1960s  pratt and whitney licensed bacon s u s  patents for use in the u s  space program to supply electricity and drinking water  hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks   in 1991  the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by  
was the first company to manufacture and commercialize a large  stationary fuel cell system for use as a
power plant in hospitals  universities and large office buildings 
in recognition of the fuel cell industry and americas role in fuel cell development  the us senate recognized october 8  2015 as national hydrogen and fuel cell day  passing s  res 217  the date was chosen in recognition of the atomic weight of hydrogen  1.008  
types of fuel cells  design  
fuel cells come in many varieties  however  they all work in the same general manner  they are made up of three adjacent segments  the   the   and the   two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments  the net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed  water or carbon dioxide is created  and an electric current is created  which can be used to power electrical devices  normally referred to as the load 
at the anode a
oxidizes the fuel  usually hydrogen  turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron  the electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it  but the electrons cannot  the freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current  the ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode  once reaching the cathode  the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical  usually oxygen  to create water or carbon dioxide 
a block diagram of a fuel cell
the most important design features in a fuel cell are   
the electrolyte substance  the electrolyte substance usually defines the type of fuel cell 
the fuel that is used  the most common fuel is hydrogen 
the anode catalyst breaks down the fuel into electrons and ions  the anode catalyst is usually made up of very fine platinum powder 
the cathode catalyst turns the ions into the waste chemicals like water or carbon dioxide  the cathode catalyst is often made up of nickel but it can also be a nanomaterial-based catalyst 
a typical fuel cell produces a voltage from 0.6 v to 0.7 v at full rated load  voltage decreases as current increases  due to several factors 
ohmic loss   due to resistance of the cell components and interconnections 
mass transport loss  depletion of reactants at catalyst sites under high loads  causing rapid loss of voltage  
to deliver the desired amount of energy  the fuel cells can be combined in
to yield higher   and in parallel to allow a higher
to be supplied  such a design is called a fuel cell stack  the cell surface area can also be increased  to allow higher current from each cell  within the stack  reactant gases must be distributed uniformly over each of the cells to maximize the power output 
proton exchange membrane fuel cells  pemfcs   
main article 
in the archetypical hydrogenoxide
design  a proton-conducting polymer membrane  typically   contains the
solution that separates the
and
sides  this was called a  solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell   spefc  in the early 1970s  before the proton exchange mechanism was well-understood   notice that the synonyms  polymer electrolyte membrane  and  proton exchange mechanism  result in the same   
on the anode side  hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it later dissociates into protons and electrons  these protons often react with oxidants causing them to become what are commonly referred to as multi-facilitated proton membranes  the protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode  but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit  supplying power  because the membrane is electrically insulating  on the cathode catalyst  oxygen
react with the electrons  which have traveled through the external circuit  and protons to form water 
in addition to this pure hydrogen type  there are
fuels for fuel cells  including  
 see 
and   and chemical hydrides  the waste products with these types of fuel are
and water  when hydrogen is used  the co2 is released when methane from natural gas is combined with steam  in a process called   to produce the hydrogen  this can take place in a different location to the fuel cell  potentially allowing the hydrogen fuel cell to be used indoorsfor example  in fork lifts

cost  in 2013  the department of energy estimated that 80-kw automotive fuel cell system costs of us 67 per kilowatt could be achieved  assuming volume production of 100,000 automotive units per year and us 55 per kilowatt could be achieved  assuming volume production of 500,000 units per year  many companies are working on techniques to reduce cost in a variety of ways including reducing the amount of platinum needed in each individual cell 
has experimented with a catalyst enhanced with carbon silk  which allows a 30  reduction  1mg cm to 0.7mg cm  in platinum usage without reduction in performance   
uses
as a   a 2011 published study doi  10.1021 ja1112904 documented the first metal-free electrocatalyst using relatively inexpensive doped   which are less than 1  the cost of platinum and are of equal or superior performance  a recently published article demonstrated how the environmental burdens change when using carbon nanotubes as carbon substrate for platinum 
water and air management  in pemfcs   in this type of fuel cell  the membrane must be hydrated  requiring water to be evaporated at precisely the same rate that it is produced  if water is evaporated too quickly  the membrane dries  resistance across it increases  and eventually it will crack  creating a gas  short circuit  where hydrogen and oxygen combine directly  generating heat that will damage the fuel cell  if the water is evaporated too slowly  the electrodes will flood  preventing the reactants from reaching the catalyst and stopping the reaction  methods to manage water in cells are being developed like
focusing on flow control  just as in a combustion engine  a steady ratio between the reactant and oxygen is necessary to keep the fuel cell operating efficiently 
temperature management  the same temperature must be maintained throughout the cell in order to prevent destruction of the cell through   this is particularly challenging as the 2h2   o2 -  2h2o reaction is highly exothermic  so a large quantity of heat is generated within the fuel cell 
durability    and special requirements for some type of cells 
typically require more than 40,000 hours of reliable operation at a temperature of 35c to 40c  31f to 104f   while automotive fuel cells require a 5,000-hour lifespan  the equivalent of 240,000km  150,000mi   under extreme temperatures  current
is 2,500 hours  about 75,000 miles   automotive engines must also be able to start reliably at 30c  22f  and have a high power-to-volume ratio  typically 2.5kw per liter

phosphoric acid fuel cell  pafc   
main article 
phosphoric acid fuel cells  pafc  were first designed and introduced in 1961 by
and   in these cells phosphoric acid is used as a non-conductive electrolyte to pass positive hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode  these cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees celsius  this high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly  this heat can be used to produce steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal energy consuming system  using this heat in
can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 4050  to about 80   phosphoric acid  the electrolyte used in pafcs  is a non-conductive liquid acid which forces electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit  since the hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small  platinum is used as catalyst to increase this ionization rate  a key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte  this increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid 
solid acid fuel cell  safc   
main article 
solid acid fuel cells  safcs  are characterized by the use of a solid acid material as the electrolyte  at low temperatures 
have an ordered molecular structure like most salts  at warmer temperatures  between 140 and 150 degrees celsius for cshso4   some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered  superprotonic  structures  which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude  the first proof-of-concept safcs were developed in 2000 using cesium hydrogen sulfate  cshso4   current safc systems use cesium dihydrogen phosphate  csh2po4  and have demonstrated lifetimes in the thousands of hours 
high-temperature fuel cells  
sofc  
main article 
 sofcs  use a solid material  most commonly a ceramic material called
 ysz   as the   because sofcs are made entirely of solid materials  they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes  they require high
 8001000c  and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas 
sofcs are unique since in those  negatively charged oxygen
travel from the
 positive side of the fuel cell  to the
 negative side of the fuel cell  instead of positively charged hydrogen ions travelling from the anode to the cathode  as is the case in all other types of fuel cells  oxygen gas is fed through the cathode  where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions  the oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode  the reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products  carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel  but the carbon emissions from an sofc system are less than those from a fossil fuel combustion plant  the chemical reactions for the sofc system can be expressed as follows 
anode reaction  2h2   2o2  2h2o   4e
cathode reaction  o2   4e  2o2
overall cell reaction  2h2   o2  2h2o
sofc systems can run on fuels other than pure hydrogen gas  however  since hydrogen is necessary for the reactions listed above  the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms  for the fuel cell to operate  the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas  sofcs are capable of internally
light hydrocarbons such as
 natural gas   propane and butane  these fuel cells are at an early stage of development 
challenges exist in sofc systems due to their high operating temperatures  one such challenge is the potential for carbon dust to build up on the anode  which slows down the internal reforming process  research to address this  carbon coking  issue at the university of pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based
 heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal  can reduce coking and the loss of performance  another disadvantage of sofc systems is slow start-up time  making sofcs less useful for mobile applications  despite these disadvantages  a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum  thereby reducing cost  additionally  waste heat from sofc systems may be captured and reused  increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80 85  
the high operating temperature is largely due to the physical properties of the ysz electrolyte  as temperature decreases  so does the
of ysz  therefore  to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell  a high operating temperature is required  according to their website    a uk sofc fuel cell manufacturer  has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their sofc system to 500600 degrees celsius  they replaced the commonly used ysz electrolyte with a cgo  cerium gadolinium oxide  electrolyte  the lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate  which reduces cost and start-up time of the system 
hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell  
the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell or
was designed and first demonstrated publicly by francis thomas bacon in 1959  it was used as a primary source of electrical energy in the apollo space program  the cell consists of two porous carbon electrodes impregnated with a suitable catalyst such as pt  ag  coo  etc  the space between the two electrodes is filled with a concentrated solution of koh or naoh which serves as an electrolyte  h2 gas and o2 gas are bubbled into the electrolyte through the porous carbon electrodes  thus the overall reaction involves the combination of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water  the cell runs continuously until the reactant s supply is exhausted  this type of cell operates efficiently in the temperature range 343 k to 413 k and provides a potential of about 0.9 v 
mcfc  
main article 
 mcfcs  require a high operating temperature  650c  1,200f   similar to   mcfcs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as an electrolyte  and this salt liquefies at high temperatures  allowing for the movement of charge within the cell  in this case  negative carbonate ions 
like sofcs  mcfcs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode  eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally  the reforming process creates co2 emissions  mcfc-compatible fuels include natural gas  biogas and gas produced from coal  the hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water  carbon dioxide  electrons and small amounts of other chemicals  the electrons travel through an external circuit creating electricity and return to the cathode  there  oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte  completing the circuit  the chemical reactions for an mcfc system can be expressed as follows 
anode reaction  co32   h2  h2o   co2   2e
cathode reaction  co2   o2   2e  co32
overall cell reaction  h2   o2  h2o
as with sofcs  mcfc disadvantages include slow start-up times because of their high operating temperature  this makes mcfc systems not suitable for mobile applications  and this technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel cell purposes  the main challenge of mcfc technology is the cells  short life span  the high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode  these factors accelerate the degradation of mcfc components  decreasing the durability and cell life  researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance 
mcfcs hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies  including their resistance to impurities  they are not prone to  carbon coking   which refers to carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel
process  therefore  carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system  the department of energy claims that coal  itself  might even be a fuel option in the future  assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen  mcfcs also have relatively high efficiencies  they can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50   considerably higher than the 3742  efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant  efficiencies can be as high as 65  when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine  and 85  if heat is captured and used in a
 chp  system 
fuelcell energy  a connecticut-based fuel cell manufacturer  develops and sells mcfc fuel cells  the company says that their mcfc products range from 300kw to 2.8mw systems that achieve 47  electrical efficiency and can utilize chp technology to obtain higher overall efficiencies  one product  the dfc-erg  is combined with a gas turbine and  according to the company  it achieves an electrical efficiency of 65

theoretical maximum efficiency  
the energy efficiency of a system or device that converts energy is measured by the ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system   output energy   to the total amount of energy that is put in   input energy   or by useful output energy as a percentage of the total input energy  in the case of fuel cells  useful output energy is measured in
produced by the system  input energy is the energy stored in the fuel  according to the u s  department of energy  fuel cells are generally between 4060  energy efficient  this is higher than some other systems for energy generation  for example  the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25  energy efficient  in combined heat and power  chp  systems  the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use  increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 8590  
the theoretical maximum efficiency of any type of power generation system is never reached in practice  and it does not consider other steps in power generation  such as production  transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power  however  this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation  the maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83   operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants  assuming no heat recapture  according to the world energy council  this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58  for internal combustion engines  while these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications  high-temperature fuel cells   or   can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit  a gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell s operational efficiency  this solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80  
in practice  
in a
the tank-to-wheel efficiency is greater than 45  at low loads and shows average values of about 36  when a driving cycle like the nedc    is used as test procedure  the comparable nedc value for a diesel vehicle is 22   in 2008 honda released a demonstration fuel cell electric vehicle  the   with fuel stack claiming a 60  tank-to-wheel efficiency 
it is also important to take losses due to fuel production  transportation  and storage into account  fuel cell vehicles running on compressed hydrogen may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22  if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas  and 17  if it is stored as   fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery  except as hydrogen  but in some applications  such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as
or   they are combined with
and storage systems to form an energy storage system  most hydrogen  however  is produced by   and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide  the overall efficiency  electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity  of such plants  known as round-trip efficiency   using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be  from 35 up to 50 percent   depending on gas density and other conditions  while a much cheaper
might return about 90   the electrolyzer fuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen  and is therefore better suited for long-term storage 
solid-oxide fuel cells produce heat from the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen  the ceramic can run as hot as 800 degrees celsius  this heat can be captured and used to heat water in a
 m-chp  application  when the heat is captured  total efficiency can reach 8090  at the unit  but does not consider production and distribution losses  chp units are being developed today for the european home market 
professor jeremy p  meyers  in the
journal interface in 2008  wrote   while fuel cells are efficient relative to combustion engines  they are not as efficient as batteries  due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction  and     the oxygen evolution reaction  should the hydrogen be formed by electrolysis of water       t hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid  or when fuel can be provided continuously  for applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups     where zero emissions are a requirement  as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses  and where hydrogen is considered an acceptable reactant  a  pem fuel cell  is becoming an increasingly attractive choice  if exchanging batteries is inconvenient    in 2013 military organisations are evaluating fuel cells to significantly reduce the battery weight carried by soldiers

since fuel cell electrolyzer systems do not store fuel in themselves  but rather rely on external storage units  they can be successfully applied in large-scale energy storage  rural areas being one example  there are many different types of stationary fuel cells so efficiencies vary  but most are between 40  and 60  energy efficient  however  when the fuel cell s waste heat is used to heat a building in a cogeneration system this efficiency can increase to 85   this is significantly more efficient than traditional coal power plants  which are only about one third energy efficient  assuming production at scale  fuel cells could save 2040  on energy costs when used in cogeneration systems  fuel cells are also much cleaner than traditional power generation  a fuel cell power plant using natural gas as a hydrogen source would create less than one ounce of pollution  other than co2  for every 1,000kwh produced  compared to 25 pounds of pollutants generated by conventional combustion systems  fuel cells also produce 97  less nitrogen oxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power plants 
one such pilot program is operating on
in washington state  there the stuart island energy initiative has built a complete  closed-loop system  solar panels power an electrolyzer  which makes hydrogen  the hydrogen is stored in a 500-u s -gallon  1,900l  tank at 200 pounds per square inch  1,400kpa   and runs a relion fuel cell to provide full electric back-up to the off-the-grid residence  another closed system loop was unveiled in late 2011 in hempstead  ny 
fuel cells can be used with low-quality gas from landfills or waste-water treatment plants to generate power and lower methane emissions  a 2.8 mw fuel cell plant in california is said to be the largest of the type 
cogeneration  
combined heat and power  chp  fuel cell systems  including
 microchp  systems are used to generate both electricity and heat for homes  see    office building and factories  the system generates constant electric power  selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed   and at the same time produces hot air and water from the   as the result chp systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems  a typical capacity range of
is 13kwel   48kwth  chp systems linked to
use their waste heat for  
the waste heat from fuel cells can be diverted during the summer directly into the ground providing further cooling while the waste heat during winter can be pumped directly into the building  the university of minnesota owns the patent rights to this type of system
co-generation systems can reach 85  efficiency  4060  electric   remainder as thermal   phosphoric-acid fuel cells  pafc  comprise the largest segment of existing chp products worldwide and can provide combined efficiencies close to 90   molten carbonate  mcfc  and solid oxide fuel cells  sofc  are also used for combined heat and power generation and have electrical energy efficiences around 60   disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow ramping up and down rates  high cost and short lifetime  also their need to have a hot water storage tank to smooth out the thermal heat production was a serious disadvantage in the domestic market place where space in domestic properties is at a great premium 
delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64  of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012  the japanese ene farm project will pass 100,000 fc mchp systems in 2014  34.213 pemfc and 2.224 sofc were installed in the period 2012-2014  30,000 units on

automobiles  
as of 2015  two
have been introduced for commercial lease and sale in limited quantities  the
and the   additional demonstration models include the   and   as of june 2011 demonstration fcevs had driven more than 4,800,000km  3,000,000mi   with more than 27,000 refuelings  demonstration fuel cell vehicles have been produced with  a driving range of more than 400km  250mi  between refueling   they can be refueled in less than 5 minutes  the u s  department of energy s fuel cell technology program claims that  as of 2011  fuel cells achieved 5359  efficiency at one-quarter power and 4253  vehicle efficiency at full power  and a durability of over 120,000km  75,000mi  with less than 10  degradation  in a well-to-wheels simulation analysis that  did not address the economics and market constraints   general motors and its partners estimated that per mile traveled  a fuel cell electric vehicle running on compressed gaseous hydrogen produced from natural gas could use about 40  less energy and emit 45  less greenhouse gasses than an internal combustion vehicle  a lead engineer from the department of energy whose team is testing fuel cell cars said in 2011 that the potential appeal is that  these are full-function vehicles with no limitations on range or refueling rate so they are a direct replacement for any vehicle  for instance  if you drive a full sized suv and pull a boat up into the mountains  you can do that with this technology and you can t with current battery-only vehicles  which are more geared toward city driving  
in 2014  toyota introduced its first fuel cell vehicle in japan  the mirai  at a price of less than us 100,000  although former european parliament president
estimates that toyota will initially lose about  100,000 on each mirai sold  hyundai introduced the limited production   other manufacturers that have announced intentions to sell fuel cell electric vehicles commercially by 2016 include general motors  honda  mercedes-benz  and nissan 
criticism  
some experts believe that hydrogen fuel cell cars will never become economically competitive with other technologies or that it will take decades for them to become profitable  elon musk stated in 2015 that fuel cells for use in cars will never be commercially viable because of the inefficiency of producing  transporting and storing hydrogen and the flammability of the gas  among other reasons  professor jeremy p  meyers estimated in 2008 that cost reductions over a production ramp-up period will take about 20 years after fuel-cell cars are introduced before they will be able to compete commercially with current market technologies  including gasoline internal combustion engines  in 2011  the chairman and ceo of     stated that while the cost of hydrogen fuel cell cars is decreasing   the car is still too expensive and probably won t be practical until the 2020-plus period  i don t know  
in 2012  lux research  inc  issued a report that stated   the dream of a hydrogen economy     is no nearer   it concluded that  capital cost     will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 gw  by 2030  providing  a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption  except in niche applications   the analysis concluded that  by 2030  pem stationary market will reach  1 billion  while the vehicle market  including forklifts  will reach a total of  2 billion  other analyses cite the lack of an extensive
in the u s  as an ongoing challenge to fuel cell electric vehicle commercialization  in 2006  a study for the ieee showed that for hydrogen produced via electrolysis of water   only about 25  of the power generated from wind  water  or sun is converted to practical use   the study further noted that  electricity obtained from hydrogen fuel cells appears to be four times as expensive as electricity drawn from the electrical transmission grid      because of the high energy losses  hydrogen  cannot compete with electricity   furthermore  the study found   natural gas reforming is not a sustainable solution    the large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds  water  natural gas  biomass   package the light gas by compression or liquefaction  transfer the energy carrier to the user  plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells  leaves around 25  for practical use  
  the author of
 2005   devoted two articles in 2014 to updating his critique of the use of fuel cells in cars  he stated that fcvs still had not overcome the following issues  high cost of the vehicles  high fueling cost  and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure   it would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades   most importantly  he said   fcvs aren t green  because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced  as 95  of it is  using the steam reforming process  he concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an fcv fleet  either now or in the future    s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014  in 2015  clean technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles  so did   another clean technica writer concluded   while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage  especially seasonal storage   it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles  
buses  
at the  
as of august 2011  there were a total of approximately 100
deployed around the world  most buses are produced by   toyota  ballard    and proton motor  utc buses had accumulated over 970,000km  600,000mi  of driving by 2011  fuel cell buses have a 39141  higher fuel economy than diesel buses and natural gas buses  fuel cell buses have been deployed around the world including in whistler  canada  san francisco  united states  hamburg  germany  shanghai  china  london  england  and so paulo  brazil 
the
is a global cooperative effort in trial fuel cell buses  notable projects include 
12 fuel cell buses are being deployed in the oakland and san francisco bay area of california 
  with 36 experimental buses powered by
fuel cells  completed a successful three-year trial in eleven cities  in january 2007 
a fleet of thor buses with
fuel cells was deployed in california  operated by sunline transit agency 
the first
fuel cell bus prototype in brazil was deployed in   the bus was manufactured in
and the hydrogen fuel will be produced in
from water through   the program  called  nibus brasileiro a hidrognio   brazilian hydrogen autobus   includes three additional buses 
forklifts  
a
 also called a fuel cell lift truck  is a fuel cell-powered industrial
used to lift and transport materials  in 2013 there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in
in the us  of which only 500 received funding from
 2012   the global market is 1 million fork lifts per year  fuel cell fleets are operated by various companies  including sysco foods  fedex freight  genco  at wegmans  coca-cola  kimberly clark  and whole foods   and h-e-b grocers  europe demonstrated 30 fuel cell forklifts with hylift and extended it with hylift-europe to 200 units  with other projects in france
and   pike research stated in 2011 that fuel cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020 
most companies in europe and the us do not use petroleum-powered forklifts  as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts  fuel cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery-powered forklifts as they can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes  fuel cell-powered forklifts can be used in refrigerated warehouses  as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures  the fc units are often designed as drop-in replacements 
motorcycles and bicycles  
in 2005 a british manufacturer of hydrogen-powered fuel cells 
 ie   produced the first working hydrogen run motorcycle called the
 emission neutral vehicle   the motorcycle holds enough fuel to run for four hours  and to travel 160km  100mi  in an urban area  at a top speed of 80km h  50mph   in 2004
developed a
that utilized the honda fc stack 
other examples of motorbikes and bicycles that use hydrogen fuel cells include the taiwanese company apfct s scooter using the fueling system from italy s acta spa and the
burgman scooter with an
fuel cell that received eu
in 2011  suzuki motor corp  and ie have announced a joint venture to accelerate the commercialization of zero-emission vehicles 
airplanes  
researchers and industry partners throughout europe conducted experimental flight tests in february 2008 of a manned airplane powered only by a fuel cell and lightweight batteries  the fuel cell demonstrator airplane  as it was called  used a proton exchange membrane  pem  fuel cell  hybrid system to power an electric motor  which was coupled to a conventional propeller  in 2003  the world s first propeller-driven airplane to be powered entirely by a fuel cell was flown  the fuel cell was a stack design that allowed the fuel cell to be integrated with the plane s aerodynamic surfaces 
fuel cell-powered unmanned aerial vehicles  uav  include a
fuel cell uav that set the record distance flown for a small uav in 2007  the military is interested in this application because of its low noise  low thermal signature and ability to attain high altitude  in 2009 the naval research laboratory s  nrl s  ion tiger utilized a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and flew for 23 hours and 17 minutes  fuel cells are also in use to provide auxiliary power in aircraft  replacing
that were previously used to start the engines and power on board electrical needs   
in january 2016 a raptor e1 drone made a successful test flight using a fuel cell that was lighter than the
it replaced  the flight lasted 10 minutes at an altitude of 80 metres  260ft   although the fuel cell reportedly had enough fuel to fly for two hours  the fuel was contained in approximately 100 solid 1 square centimetre  0.16sqin  pellets composed of a proprietary chemical within an unpressurized cartridge  the pellets are physically robust and operate at temperatures as warm as 50c  122f   the cell was from arcola energy 
boats  
the world s first certified fuel cell boat     in  germany
the world s first fuel-cell boat
used an afc system with 6.5kw net output  iceland has committed to converting its vast fishing fleet to use fuel cells to provide auxiliary power by 2015 and  eventually  to provide primary power in its boats  amsterdam recently introduced its first fuel cell-powered boat that ferries people around the city s canals 
submarines  
the
of the german and italian navies use fuel cells to remain submerged for weeks without the need to surface 
the u212a is a non-nuclear submarine developed by german naval shipyard howaldtswerke deutsche werft  the system consists of nine pem fuel cells  providing between 30kw and 50kw each  the ship is silent  giving it an advantage in the detection of other submarines  a naval paper has theorized about the possibility of a nuclear-fuel cell hybrid whereby the fuel cell is used when silent operations are required and then replenished from the nuclear reactor  and water

fueling stations  
main articles 
and
 
there were over 85 hydrogen refueling stations in the u s  in 2010  some of these have closed  and in november 2013 
reported that there were  10 hydrogen stations available to the public in the entire united states  one in   eight in southern california and the one in    in 2013 the department of energy launched h2usa focused on advancing the hydrogen infrastructure  as of july 2015  there were 12 public hydrogen fueling stations in the us  10 of which were in california 
the first public hydrogen refueling station in iceland operated from 2003 to 2007  it served three buses in the public transport net of   the station produced its own hydrogen with an electrolyzing unit  the 14 stations in germany were planned to be expanded to 50 by 2015 through its

in 2012  fuel cell industry revenues exceeded  1 billion market value worldwide  with asian pacific countries shipping more than 3/4 of the fuel cell systems worldwide  however  as of january 2014  no public company in the industry had yet become profitable  there were 140,000 fuel cell stacks shipped globally in 2010  up from 11,000 shipments in 2007  and from 2011 to 2012 worldwide fuel cell shipments had an annual growth rate of 85  
expanded its manufacturing facilities in 2011  approximately 50  of fuel cell shipments in 2010 were stationary fuel cells  up from about a third in 2009  and the four dominant producers in the fuel cell industry were the united states  germany  japan and south korea  the department of energy solid state energy conversion alliance found that  as of january 2011  stationary fuel cells generated power at approximately  724 to  775 per kilowatt installed  in 2011  bloom energy  a major fuel cell supplier  said that its fuel cells generated power at 911 cents per kilowatt-hour  including the price of fuel  maintenance  and hardware 
industry groups predict that there are sufficient platinum resources for future demand  and in 2007  research at
suggested that platinum could be replaced by a gold- coating  which may be less susceptible to poisoning and thereby improve fuel cell lifetime  another method would use iron and sulphur instead of platinum  this would lower the cost of a fuel cell  as the platinum in a regular fuel cell costs around us 1,500  and the same amount of iron costs only around us 1.50   the concept was being developed by a coalition of the
