an absorption refrigerator is a
that uses a heat source  e g  
energy  a fossil-fueled flame  waste heat from factories  or
systems  to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling process 
absorption refrigerators are often used for food storage in   the principle can also be used to
buildings using the waste heat from a
or   using waste heat from a gas turbine makes the turbine very efficient because it first produces   then hot water  and finally  air-conditioning  called  trigeneration  
the standard for the absorption refrigerator is given by the ansi ahri standard 560-2000

history  
in the early years of the twentieth century  the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used  but after the development of the
it lost much of its importance because of its low
 about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle   nowadays  the vapor absorption cycle is used only where waste heat is available or where heat is derived from   absorption refrigerators are a popular alternative to regular compressor refrigerators where electricity is unreliable  costly  or unavailable  where noise from the compressor is problematic  or where surplus heat is available  e g   from turbine exhausts or industrial processes  or from solar plants  
absorption cooling was invented by the french scientist
in 1858  the original design used water and sulphuric acid 
in 1922
and   while they were still students at the
in     enhanced the principle with a 3-fluid configuration  this  platen-munters  design can operate without a pump 
commercial production began in 1923 by the newly formed company ab arctic  which was bought by
in 1925  in the 1960s  the absorption refrigeration saw a renaissance due to the substantial demand for refrigerators for
 travel trailers   ab electrolux established a subsidiary in the united states  named dometic sales corporation  the company marketed refrigerators for
under the
brand  in 2001  electrolux sold most of its leisure products line to the venture-capital company
which created dometic as a stand-alone company 
in 1926 
and his former student
proposed an alternative design known as the  
at the 2007  
presented his research of a new  very small   intermittent absorption  vaccine refrigeration unit for use in third world countries  the refrigerator is a small unit placed over a campfire  that can later be used to cool 15 liters of water to just above freezing for 24 hours in a 30c environment 
principles  
absorption cooling process
both absorption and
use a refrigerant with a very low
 less than 0f  18c    in both types  when this refrigerant evaporates  boils   it takes some heat away with it  providing the cooling effect  the main difference between the two systems is the way the refrigerant is changed from a gas back into a liquid so that the cycle can repeat  an absorption refrigerator changes the gas back into a liquid using a method that needs only heat  and has no moving parts other than the refrigerant itself 
the absorption cooling cycle can be described in three phases 
evaporation  a liquid refrigerant evaporates in a low
environment  thus extracting heat from its surroundings  e g  the refrigerator s compartment   because of the low partial pressure  the temperature needed for evaporation is also low 
absorption  the now gaseous refrigerant is absorbed by another liquid  e g  a salt solution  
regeneration  the refrigerant-saturated liquid is heated  causing the refrigerant to evaporate out  the hot gaseous refrigerant passes through a heat exchanger  transferring its heat outside the system  such as to surrounding ambient-temperature air   and condenses  the condensed  liquid  refrigerant supplies the evaporation phase 
in comparison  a compressor refrigerator uses an electrically powered compressor to increase the pressure on the gaseous refrigerant  the resulting hot  high-pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger   condenser   that is exposed to the external environment  usually air in the room   the condensed refrigerant  now at a temperature near to that of the external environment  then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section  the orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the high pressure condenser section and the low pressure evaporator section  the lower pressure in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate  which
from the refrigerator food compartment  the now-vaporized refrigerant then goes back into the compressor to repeat the cycle 
another difference between the two types is the refrigerant used  compressor refrigerators typically use an
or   while absorption refrigerators typically use
or  
simple salt and water system  
a simple absorption refrigeration system common in large commercial plants uses a solution of
and
salt and water  water under low pressure is evaporated from the coils that are being chilled  the water is absorbed by a lithium bromide water solution  the system drives the water off the lithium bromide solution with heat 
water spray absorption refrigeration  
water spray absorption system
another variant  depicted to the right  uses air  water  and a salt water solution  the intake of warm  moist air is passed through a sprayed solution of salt water  the spray lowers the humidity but does not significantly change the temperature  the less humid  warm air is then passed through an   consisting of a spray of fresh water  which cools and re-humidifies the air  humidity is removed from the cooled air with another spray of salt solution  providing the outlet of cool  dry air 
the salt solution is regenerated by heating it under low pressure  causing water to evaporate  the water evaporated from the salt solution is re-condensed  and rerouted back to the evaporative cooler 
single pressure absorption refrigeration  
labeled photo of a domestic absorption refrigerator  1  hydrogen enters the pipe with liquid ammonia
2  ammonia and hydrogen enter the inner compartment of the refrigerator  an increase in volume causes a decrease in the partial pressure of the liquid ammonia  the ammonia evaporates  taking heat from the liquid ammonia  hvap  and thus lowering its temperature  heat flows from the hotter interior of the refrigerator to the colder liquid  promoting further evaporation 
3  ammonia and hydrogen return from the inner compartment  ammonia returns to absorber and dissolves in water  hydrogen is free to rise upwards

a single-pressure absorption refrigerator takes advantage of the fact that a substance s boiling point depends upon the partial pressure of the vapor above the liquid and goes down with lower partial pressure  while having the same total pressure throughout the system  the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure of the refrigerant  therefore low boiling point  in the part of the system that draws heat out of the low-temperature interior of the refrigerator  but maintains the refrigerant at high partial pressure  therefore high boiling point  in the part of the system that expels heat to the ambient-temperature air outside the refrigerator 
the refrigerator uses three substances   
gas  and   the cycle is closed  with all hydrogen  water and ammonia collected and endlessly reused  the system is pressurized to the pressure where the boiling point of ammonia is higher than the temperature of the condenser coil  the coil which transfers heat to the air outside the refrigerator  by being hotter than the outside air  this pressure is typically 14-16atm  at which pressure the dew point of ammonia will be about 95f  35c  
the cooling cycle starts with liquid ammonia entering the evaporator at room temperature  the volume of the evaporator is greater than the volume of the liquid  with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen  the presence of hydrogen lowers the
of the ammonia gas  thus lowering the
of the liquid below the temperature of the refrigerator s interior  ammonia evaporates  taking a small amount of heat from the liquid and lowering the liquid s temperature  until it reaches that boiling point  it then continues to evaporate  without the liquid descending below the boiling point  while the large
 heat  flows from the warmer refrigerator interior to the cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas 
in the next two steps  the ammonia gas is separated from the hydrogen to take advantage of the full-pressure ammonia s higher boiling point 
the ammonia  gas  and hydrogen  gas  mixture flows through a pipe from the evaporator into the absorber  in the absorber  this mixture of gasses contacts a solution of ammonia  liquid  in water  liquid   the gasseous ammonia dissolves in the water and the hydrogen collects at the top of the absorber  while the ammonia  liquid  and water  liquid  solution remains at the bottom  the hydrogen is now separate while the ammonia is now dissolved in the water 
the next step separates the ammonia and water  the ammonia water solution flows to the generator  where heat is applied to evaporate the ammonia  leaving most of the water  with its higher boiling point  behind  some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia  this water is removed in the final separation step  by passing it through the separator  an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles  allowing the water vapor to condense and drain back to the generator 
the pure ammonia gas then enters the condenser  in this   the hot ammonia gas transfers its heat to the outside air  which is below the boiling point of the full-pressure ammonia  and therefore condenses  the condensed  liquid  ammonia flows down to be mixed with the hydrogen gas from the absorption step  allowing the cycle to repeat
