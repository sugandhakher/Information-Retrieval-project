audi ag  pronounced      is a
that designs  engineers  produces  markets and distributes   audi oversees worldwide operations from its headquarters in     germany  audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide 
the origins of the company are complex  going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises   and the audiwerke  founded by engineer   and two other manufacturers   and    leading to the foundation of
in 1932  the modern era of audi essentially began in the 1960s when auto union was acquired by
from   after relaunching the audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the
series  volkswagen merged auto union with
in 1969  thus creating the present day form of the company 
the company name is based on the
translation of the surname of the founder     horch   meaning  listen  in   becomes  audi  in latin  the four rings of the audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create audi s predecessor company  auto union  audi s slogan is   meaning  advancement through technology   however  since 2007 audi usa has used the slogan  truth in engineering   audi is among the best-selling luxury automobiles in the world

history
birth of the company and its name
originally in 1885 
company wanderer was established  later becoming a branch of audi ag  another company  nsu  which also later merged into audi  was founded during this time  and later supplied the chassis for  s four-wheeler 
on 14 november 1899 
 18681951  established the company a  horch   cie  in the
district of   three years later in 1902 he moved with his company to   on may  10th  1904 he founded the august horch   cie  motorwagenwerke ag  a joint-stock company in
 state of   
after troubles with horch chief financial officer  august horch left motorwagenwerke and founded in zwickau on 16 july 1909  his second company  the august horch automobilwerke gmbh  his former partners sued him for trademark infringement  the german
 supreme court  in leipzig  eventually determined that the horch brand belonged to his former company 
audi type e
since august horch was banned from using  horch  as a trade name in his new car business  he called a meeting with close business friends  paul and franz fikentscher from zwickau  germany  at the apartment of franz fikentscher  they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company  during this meeting  franz s son was quietly studying latin in a corner of the room  several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working  until he finally blurted out   father    wouldn t it be a good idea to call it audi instead of horch    horch   in german means  hark   or  hear   which is  audi  in the singular imperative form of  audire    to listen   in latin  the idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting  on 25 april 1910 the audi automobilwerke gmbh zwickau  from 1915 on audiwerke ag zwickau  was entered in the company s register of zwickau registration court 
the first audi automobile  the
10/22hp  16kw  sport-phaeton  was produced in the same year  followed by the successor
10/28ps in the same year 
audi started with a 2,612cc
model type a  followed by a 3,564cc model  as well as 4,680cc and 5,720cc models  these cars were successful even in sporting events  the first
model type m  4,655cc appeared in 1924 
august horch left the audiwerke in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport  but he was still involved with audi as a member of the board of trustees  in september 1921  audi became the first german car manufacturer to present a production car  the audi type k  with left-handed drive  left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic  making overtaking safer 
the merger of the four companies under the logo of four rings
main article 
in august 1928    the owner of
 dkw   acquired the majority of shares in audiwerke ag  in the same year  rasmussen bought the remains of the u s 
  including the manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines  these engines were used in audi zwickau and audi dresden models that were launched in 1929  at the same time  six-cylinder and four-cylinder   with a
engine  models were manufactured  audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork 
in 1932  audi merged with   dkw  and   to form
ag    it was during this period that the company offered the
that became the first european car to combine a six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive  it used a powertrain shared with the wanderer  but turned 180-degrees  so that the drive shaft faced the front 
before   auto union used the four interlinked rings that make up the audi badge today  representing these four brands  this badge was used  however  only on auto union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems  the technological development became more and more concentrated and some audi models were propelled by horch or wanderer built engines 
reflecting the economic pressures of the time  auto union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars through the 1930s  so that by 1938 the company s dkw brand accounted for 17.9  of the german car market  while audi held only 0.1   after the final few audis were delivered in 1939 the  audi  name disappeared completely from the new car market for more than two decades 
post-world war ii
like most german manufacturing  at the onset of world war ii the auto union plants were retooled for military production  and were a target for allied bombing during the war which left them damaged 
overrun by the
in 1945  on the orders of the soviet union military administration the factories were dismantled as part of   following this  the company s entire assets were expropriated without compensation  on 17 august 1948  auto union ag of chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register  these actions had the effect of liquidating germany s auto union ag  the remains of the audi plant of zwickau became the
 for  people owned enterprise  
or awz  in english  automobile works zwickau  
with no prospect of continuing production in soviet controlled east germany  auto union executives began the process of relocating what was left of the company to   a site was chosen in  
to start a spare parts operation in late 1945  which would eventually serve as the headquarters of the reformed auto union in 1949 
the former audi factory in zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war-models in 1949  these dkw models were renamed to
and
and were similar to the west german versions  west and east german models were equipped with the traditional and renowned dkw two-stroke engines  the zwickau plant manufactured the infamous
until 1991  when it came under volkswagen controleffectively bringing it under the same umbrella as audi since 1945 
new auto union unit
a new west german headquartered auto union was launched in ingolstadt  bavaria with loans from the bavarian state government and
aid  the reformed company was launched 3 september 1949 and continued dkw s tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines  this included production of a small but sturdy 125cc motorcycle and a dkw delivery van  the
at ingolstadt  the ingolstadt site was large  consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution  but at this stage there was at ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles  for manufacturing the company s
plant capacity in
was rented from   it was only ten years later  after the company had attracted an investor that funds became available for construction of major car plant at the ingolstadt head office site 
in 1958  in response to pressure from   then their largest single shareholder 
took an 87  holding in the auto union company  and this was increased to a 100  holding in 1959  however  small two-stroke cars were not the focus of daimler-benz s interests  and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for auto union s  the company s aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as
and   the decision to dispose of the auto union business was based on its lack of profitability  ironically  by the time they sold the business  it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke engine  which would enable the auto union business  under a new owner  to embark on a period of profitable growth  now producing not auto unions or dkws  but using the  audi  name  resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap 
in 1964  volkswagen acquired a 50  holding in the business  which included the new factory in ingolstadt  the dkw and audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had been funded by daimler-benz  who in return retained the dormant horch trademark and the dsseldorf factory which became a mercedes-benz van assembly plant  eighteen months later  volkswagen bought complete control of ingolstadt  and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional 60,000
per year  two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines  in september 1965  the
was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a
for the car s front and rear  volkswagen dumped the dkw brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology  and having classified the model internally as the   sold it simply as the  audi   later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings and sold as the audi 60  75  80  and super 90  selling until 1972  initially  volkswagen was hostile to the idea of auto union as a standalone entity producing its own models having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the ingolstadt assembly plant - to the point where volkswagen executives ordered that the auto union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory buildings  then vw chief
explicitly forbade auto union from any further product development  fearing that the volkswagen had no long term ambition for the audi brand  auto union engineers under the leadership of ludwig kraus developed the first
in secret  without nordhoff s knowledge  when presented with a finished prototype  nordhoff was so impressed he authorised the car for production  which when launched in 1968  went on to be a huge success  with this  the resurrection of the audi brand was now complete  this being followed by the first generation
in 1972  which would in turn provide a template for vw s new front-wheel-drive water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s onward 
in   1973
in 1969  auto union merged with   based in   near   in the 1950s  nsu had been the world s largest manufacturer of motorcycles  but had moved on to produce small cars like the   the tt and tts versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars  nsu then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of   in 1967  the new
was a car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics  light weight  and safety  however  teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of nsu  the neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger audi models
and   the neckarsulm factory is also home of the   a subsidiary responsible for development and production of audi high-performance models  the
and the  rs  model range 
modern era
the new merged company was incorporated on 1 january 1969 and was known as audi nsu auto union ag  with its headquarters based at nsu s neckarsulm plant  and saw the emergence of audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era  volkswagen introduced the audi brand to the united states for the 1970 model year  that same year  the mid-sized car that nsu had been working on  the   originally intended to slot between the rear-engined prinz models and the futuristic   was instead launched as a volkswagen 
after the launch of the
of 1968  the  fox  which formed the basis for the 1973   followed in 1972 and the
 later rebadged as the   in 1974  the audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the
concept  one that led to a hugely successful world car  ultimately  the audi 80 and 100  progenitors of the
and   respectively  became the company s biggest sellers  whilst little investment was made in the fading nsu range  the
models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed
went out of production in 1977  spelling the effective end of the nsu brand  production of the audi 100 had been steadily moved from ingolstadt to neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed  any by the appearance of the second generation c2 version in 1976  all production was now at the former nsu plant  neckarsulm from that point onward would produce audi s higher end models 
the audi image at this time was a conservative one  and so  a proposal from chassis engineer
was accepted to develop the
technology in  s
military vehicle for an audi performance car and
racing car  the performance car  introduced in 1980  was named the     a
coup which was also the first german large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent
through a centre   commonly referred to as the  ur-quattro   the    prefix is a german
used  in this case  to mean  original  and is also applied to the first generation of audi s
and
sport saloons  as in  urs4  and  urs6    few of these vehicles were produced  all hand-built by a single team   but the model was a great success in rallying  prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars  and the audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology 
in 1985  with the auto union and nsu brands effectively dead  the company s official name was now shortened to simply audi ag  at the same time the company s headquarters moved back to ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries  auto union gmbh and nsu gmbh  were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies  the exception being horch  which had been retained by daimler-benz after the vw takeover   and to operate audi s heritage operations 
in 1986  as the passat-based
was beginning to develop a kind of  grandfather s car  image  the type 89 was introduced  this completely new development sold extremely well  however  its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine  and its base package was quite spartan  even the passenger-side mirror was an option   in 1987  audi put forward a new and very elegant   which had a much superior set of standard features  in the early 1990s  sales began to slump for the audi 80 series  and some basic construction problems started to surface 
in the early part of the 21st century  audi set forth on a german racetrack to claim and maintain several world records  such as top speed endurance  this effort was in-line with the company s heritage from the 1930s racing era  
through the early 1990s  audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against german automakers
and   this began with the release of the
in 1990  it was essentially a new engine fitted to the audi 100/200  but with noticeable bodywork differences  most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet 
by 1991  audi had the four-cylinder audi 80  the 5-cylinder
and   the turbocharged
and the audi v8  there was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4- and 5-cylinder engines 
although the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant  it was still a little too different for the target market  with the introduction of an all-new audi 100 in 1992  audi introduced a 2.8l   this engine was also fitted to a face-lifted audi 80  all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the usa   giving this model a choice of four-  five-  and six-cylinder engines  in  
and
body styles 
the five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice  however  a
230hp  170kw  version remained  the engine  initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20v of 1991  was a derivative of the engine fitted to the   it was fitted to the   and named the
and also to the audi 100 body  and named the   these two models were the beginning of the mass-produced
of performance cars 
audi 5000 unintended acceleration allegations
sales in the united states fell after a series of recalls from 1982 to 1987 of
models associated with reported incidents of
linked to six deaths and 700 accidents  at the time  nhtsa was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power 
a
report aired 23 november 1986  featuring interviews with six people who had sued audi after reporting unintended acceleration  showing an audi 5000 ostensibly suffering a problem when the brake pedal was pushed  subsequent investigation revealed that 60 minutes had engineered the failure  fitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor  linked via a hose to a hole drilled into the transmission 
c3  sold as the
in the u s 
audi contended  prior to findings by outside investigators  that the problems were caused by driver error  specifically pedal misapplication  subsequently  the
 nhtsa  concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases  including all the ones that prompted the 60 minutes report  were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals  cbs did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies  but did acknowledge the similar results of another study 
in a review study published in 2012  nhtsa summarized its past findings about the audi unintended acceleration problems   once an unintended acceleration had begun  in the audi 5000  due to a failure in the idle-stabilizer system  producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g   pedal misapplication resulting from panic  confusion  or unfamiliarity with the audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the incident  
this summary is consistent with the conclusions of nhtsa s most technical analysis at the time   audi idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g  which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a subway car   these accelerations could not be the sole cause of   long-duration  sudden acceleration incidents  sai    but might have triggered some sais by startling the driver  the defective idle-stabilization system performed a type of   significantly  multiple  intermittent malfunctions of the electronic control unit were observed and recorded     and  were also observed and  reported by transport canada  
with a series of recall campaigns  audi made several modifications  the first adjusted the distance between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models  later repairs  of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978  added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park  a legacy of the audi 5000 and other reported cases of sudden unintended acceleration are intricate
patterns and brake
mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into forward or reverse  it is unclear how the defects in the idle-stabilization system were addressed 
audi s u s  sales  which had reached 74,061 in 1985  dropped to 12,283 in 1991 and remained level for three years   with resale values falling dramatically  audi subsequently offered increased warranty protection and renamed the affected models  with the 5000 becoming the 100 and 200 in 1989  and only reached the same sales levels again by model year 2000 
a 2010 businessweek article  outlining possible parallels between audi s experience and
 noted a class-action lawsuit filed in 1987 by about 7,500 audi 5000-model owners remains unsettled and is currently being contested in county court in chicago after appeals at the illinois state and u s  federal levels 
model introductions
in the mid-to-late 1990s  audi introduced new technologies including the use of aluminum construction  produced from 1999 to 2005  the
was a futuristic super mini  born from the al2 concept  with many features that helped regain consumer confidence  like the aluminium   which was a first in production car design  in the a2 audi further expanded their tdi technology through the use of frugal three-cylinder engines  the a2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a   the audi a2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted audi as a cutting-edge manufacturer  the model  a
competitor  sold relatively well in europe  however  the a2 was discontinued in 2005 and audi decided not to develop an immediate replacement 
the next major model change came in 1995 when the
replaced the   the new nomenclature scheme was applied to the audi 100 to become the
 with a minor facelift   this also meant the s4 became the
and a new s4 was introduced in the a4 body  the s2 was discontinued  the
continued on  based on the audi 80 platform  until 1999  gaining the engine upgrades along the way  a new
model  sharing the  s platform  was introduced to the range in 1996  and the radical
and
were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings 
the engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4l  1.6l and 1.8l four-cylinder  1.8l four-cylinder turbo  2.6l and 2.8l   2.2l turbo-charged five-cylinder and the 4.2l   the v6s were replaced by new 2.4l and 2.8l 30v v6s in 1998  with marked improvement in power  torque and smoothness  further engines were added along the way  including a 3.7l v8 and 6.0l

audi ag today
audi s sales grew strongly in the 2000s  with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008  the largest sales increases came from eastern europe   19.3    africa   17.2   and the middle east   58.5    china in particular has become a key market  representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009  one factor for its popularity in china is that audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the chinese government for officials  and purchases by the government are responsible for 20  of its sales in china  as of late 2009  audi s operating profit of 1.17-billion   1.85-billion  made it the biggest contributor to parent volkswagen group s nine-month operating profit of 1.5-billion  while the other marques in group such as bentley and seat had suffered considerable losses  may 2011 saw record sales for audi of america with the new

tdi clean diesel  in may 2012  audi reported a 10  increase in its salesfrom 408 units to 480 in the last year alone 
audi manufactures vehicles in seven plants around the world  some of which are shared with other vw group marques although many sub-assemblies such as engines and transmissions are manufactured within other volkswagen group plants 
audi s two principal assembly plants are

in september 2012  audi announced the construction of its first north american manufacturing plant in   mexico  this plant is expected to be operative in 2016 and produce the second generation q5 
from 2002 up to 2003  audi headed the audi brand group  a subdivision of the volkswagen group s automotive division consisting of audi  lamborghini and seat  that was focused on sporty values  with the marques  product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the audi brand 
in 2014  most of the audi dealers in uk falsely claimed that the audi a7  a8  and r8 were euro ncap safety tested  all achieving five out of five stars  in fact none were tested 
in 2015  audi admitted that at least 2.1 million audi cars had been involved in the
in which software installed in the cars manipulated emissions data to fool regulators and allow the cars to pollute at higher than government-mandated levels  the a1  a3  a4  a5  a6  tt  q3 and q5 models were implicated in the scandal  audi promised to quickly find a technical solution and upgrade the cars so they can function within emissions regulations  ulrich hackenberg  the head of research and development at audi  was suspended in relation to the scandal  despite widespread media coverage about the scandal through the month of september  audi reported that u s  sales for the month had increased by 16.2  
in november 2015  the u s  environmental protection agency implicated the 3-liter diesel engine versions of the 2016 audi a6 quattro  a7 quattro  a8  a8l and the q5 as further models that had emissions regulation defeat-device software installed  thus  these models emitted nitrogen oxide at up to nine times the legal limit when the car detected that it was not hooked up to emissions testing equipment

audi produces 100 
to prevent   and was the first mass-market vehicle to do so  following introduction of the process by   c  1975  along with other precautionary measures  the full-body
coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust  the body s resulting durability even surpassed audi s own expectations  causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year
against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years  except for aluminium bodies which do not rust  
space frame
the audi r8 uses audi space frame technology
audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-1990s and continues to pursue new technology and high performance  an all-aluminium car was brought forward by audi  and in 1994 the
was launched  which introduced aluminium
technology  called audi space frame or asf  which saves weight and improves torsion rigidity compared to a conventional steel frame  prior to that effort  audi used examples of the type 44 chassis fabricated out of aluminium as test-beds for the technique  the disadvantage of the aluminium frame is that it is very expensive to repair and requires a specialized aluminium bodyshop  the weight reduction is somewhat offset by the
system which is standard in most markets  nonetheless  the a8 is usually the lightest all-wheel drive car in the full-size luxury segment  also having best-in-class fuel economy  the

layout
for most of its lineup  excluding the a3  a1  and tt models   audi has not adopted the transverse engine layout which is typically found in economy cars  such as peugeot and citron   since that would limit the type and power of engines that can be installed  to be able to mount powerful engines  such as a v8 engine in the
and   as well as the
in the    audi has usually engineered its more expensive cars with a
  in an  overhung  position  over the front wheels in front of the axle line - this layout dates back to the dkw and auto union saloons from the 1950s  but while this allows for the easy adoption of all-wheel drive  it goes against the ideal 50 50 weight distribution 
in all its post -era models  audi has firmly refused to adopt the traditional
layout favored by its two archrivals
and   favoring either
or   the majority of audi s lineup in the united states features all-wheel drive standard on most of its expensive vehicles  only the entry-level trims of the a4 and a6 are available with front-wheel drive   in contrast to
and
whose lineup treats all-wheel drive as an option  bmw did not offer all-wheel drive on its v8-powered cars  as opposed to crossover suvs  until the 2010 bmw 7 series and 2011 bmw 5 series  while the audi a8 has had all-wheel drive available standard since the 1990s  regarding high-performance variants 
have always had all-wheel drive  unlike their direct rivals from
and
whose cars are rear-wheel drive only  although their performance crossover suvs are all-wheel drive  
audi has recently applied the
badge to models such as the a3 and tt which do not use the -based system as in prior years with a mechanical center differential  but with the

w12 engine from the
further information 
prior to the introduction of the audi 80 and audi 50 in 1972 and 1974  respectively  audi had led the development of the ea111 and ea827
engine families  these new power units underpinned the water-cooled revival of parent company volkswagen  in the polo  golf  passat and scirocco   whilst the many derivatives and descendants of these two basic engine designs have appeared in every generation of vw group vehicles right up to the present day 
in the 1980s  audi  along with volvo  was the champion of the
cylinder 
engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional six-cylinder engines  this engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars  the 2.1l inline five-cylinder engine was used as a base for the
in the 1980s  providing well over 400 horsepower  300 kilowatts  after modification  before 1990  there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0l and 2.3l  this range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power 
for the ultra-luxury version of its
fullsize luxury flagship sedan  the audi a8l w12  audi uses the
instead of the conventional
favored by rivals mercedes-benz and bmw  the w12 engine configuration  also known as a  wr12   is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15
at an angle of 72  and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two
to drive each pair of banks  so just four are needed in total  the advantage of the w12 engine is its compact packaging  allowing audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive  whereas a conventional
could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels  in fact  the 6.0l w12 in the audi a8l w12 is smaller in overall dimensions than the 4.2l v8 that powers the audi a8 4.2 variants  the 2011 audi a8 debuted a revised 6.3-litre version of the w12  wr12  engine with 500ps  370kw  490hp  
fuel stratified injection
new models of the a3  a4  a6 and a8 have been introduced  with the ageing 1.8-litre engine now having been replaced by new
 fsi  engines  nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology 
v8 fsi engine
direct-shift gearbox
at the turn of the century  volkswagen introduced the
 dsg   a type of   it is an automated   drivable like a conventional   based on the gearbox found in the group b s1  the system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled
instead of a   this is implemented in some    
and
models where dsg is called s-tronic 
led daytime running lights
beginning in 2005  audi has implemented white
technology as
 drl  in their products  the distinctive shape of the drls has become a trademark of sorts  leds were first introduced on the   the world s first production car to have led drls  and have since spread throughout the entire model range  the leds are present on some audi  
since 2010  audi has also offered the  
the drl in an audi a4 b8
multi media interface
multi media interface-menu on  
starting with the 2003   audi has used a centralised control interface for its on-board
systems  called
 mmi   this came amid criticism of bmw s
control  it is essentially a rotating control knob and  segment  buttons  designed to control all in-car entertainment devices  radio  cd changer  ipod  tv tuner   satellite navigation  heating and ventilation  and other car controls with a screen  mmi was widely reported to be a considerable improvement on bmw s idrive  although bmw has since made their idrive more user-friendly 
the availability of mmi has gradually filtered down the audi lineup  and following its introduction on the third generation a3 in 2011  mmi is now available across the entire range  it has been generally well received  as it requires less menu-surfing with its segment buttons around a central knob  along with  main function  direct access buttons  with shortcuts to the radio or phone functions  the colour screen is mounted on the upright dashboard  and on the a4  new   a5  a6  a8  and q7  the controls are mounted horizontally

 4wd 
car that went on to win
and races worldwide  it is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time  because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing  many critics doubted the viability of four-wheel drive racers  thinking them to be too heavy and complex  yet the quattro was to become a successful car  leading its first rally it went off the road  however the rally world had been served notice 4wd was the future  the quattro went on to achieve much success in the   it won the

which dominated rally races in

finished the season in his   and helped place audi second in the manufacturers  points  audi also received rally honours in the hong kong to beijing rally in that same year    the only female driver to win a round of the world rally championship and a driver for audi  took the sport quattro s1  now simply called the  s1   and raced in the   the 1,439-metre  4,721ft  climb race pits a driver and car to drive to the summit of the 4,302-metre  14,114ft

used an audi in that same year to claim a new record for the pikes peak hill climb at 11 09.22 
in 1987  walter rhrl claimed the title for audi setting a new pikes peak international hill climb record of 10 47.85 in his audi s1  which he had retired from the wrc two years earlier  the audi s1 employed audi s time-tested
turbocharged engine  with the final version generating 441kw  600ps  591bhp   the engine was mated to a six-speed gearbox and ran on audi s famous four-wheel drive system  all of audi s top drivers drove this car  hannu mikkola  stig blomqvist  walter rhrl and michle mouton  this audi s1 started the range of audi   which now represents an increased level of sports-performance equipment within the mainstream audi model range

as audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing  they chose to move first into america with the
in 1988 
in 1989  audi moved to

with the   however as they avoided the two major endurance events  daytona and sebring  despite winning on a regular basis  they would lose out on the title 
touring cars
in 1990  having completed their objective to market cars in north america  audi returned to europe  turning first to the
 dtm  series with the   and then in 1993  being unwilling to build cars for the new formula  they turned their attention to the fast-growing
series  which are a series of national championships  audi first entered in the

 known as stw   and then to
 btcc  the year after that

in 2004  after years of competing with the
in the revitalised dtm series  with privateer team abt racing  taking the 2002 title with   audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported
cars 
24 hours of le mans
further information 
audi began racing prototype sportscars in 1999  debuting at the le mans 24 hour  two car concepts were developed and raced in their first season - the
 open-cockpit  roadster  prototype  and the
 closed-cockpit  coup  gt-prototype   the r8r scored a credible podium on its racing debut at le mans and was the concept which audi continued to develop into the 2000 season due to favourable rules for open-cockpit prototypes 
however  most of the competitors  such as bmw  toyota  mercedes and nissan  retired at the end of 1999  the factory-supported
team won at le mans three times in a row with the audi r8  20002002   as well as winning every race in the

the typeface audi type  used since 2009 
the audi emblem is four overlapping rings that represent the four
