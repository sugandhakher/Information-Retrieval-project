pollution haven hypothesis
carbon related
the pollution haven hypothesis posits that  when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad  they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require  however  this often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices 
with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent   and conversely  nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards  thus  companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to  re locate to the countries with the lowest
or weakest enforcement

three scales of the hypothesis  
1  pollution control costs have an impact at the margins  where they exert some effect on investment decisions and trade flows 
2  pollution control costs are important enough to measurably influence trade and investment 
3  countries set their environmental standards below socially-efficient levels in order to attract investment or to promote their exports 
scales 1 and 2 have empirical support  but the significance of the hypothesis relative to other investment and trade factors is still controversial  one study found that environmental regulations have a strong negative effect on a country s   particularly in pollution-intensive industries when measured by employment  however  that same study found that the environmental regulations present in a country s neighbors have an insignificant impact on that country s trade flows 
formula and variations  
yi   ri   xii   i
in the above formula  y is economic activity  r is regulatory stringency  x is an aggregate of other characteristics that affect y and  is an error term  theoretically  by changing your value of r  analysts will be able to calculate the expected effect on economic activity  according to the pollution haven hypothesis  this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated  because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with pollution-intensive productions and reduce jurisdictions  comparative advantage in these goods  this lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards  decreasing y 
there is also an expanded formula  as shown below 
yit   vi   rit   tit   rittit   xit   it
this expanded formula takes into account whether trade liberalization  i e  the level of trade barriers that exist in a country  labeled as t  increases the negative correlation between economic activity  y  and regulatory stringency  r   some authors claim that trade barriers disproportionately effect the environment  and this equation attempts to quantify the interaction between trade barriers and regulatory stringency  and the corresponding effect with respect to output in an economy 
connection with the environmental kuznets curve  
a simple recreation of the environmental kuznets curve  made using microsoft excel

the environmental kuznets curve  ekc  is a conceptual model that suggests that a country s pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a turning point  after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations  suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries  in this sense  the ekc is potentially a reflection of the pollution haven hypothesis  because one of the factors that may drive the increase in environmental degradation seen in
is an influx of waste from   this same transfer of polluting firms through trade and foreign investment could lead to the decrease in environmental degradation seen in downward-sloping section of the ekc  which models post-industrial  service  economies 
real-world example  
spent batteries that americans turn in to be recycled are increasingly being sent to mexico  where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the united states  this increased export flow is a result of strict new
standards on lead pollution  which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the united states  but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax  in this sense  mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the united states battery industry because mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money  manpower  and technical capacity to police the flow  according to the new york times  20  of spent american vehicle and industrial batteries are now exported to mexico  up from 6  in 2007  meaning that approximately 20 million batteries will cross the border this year  a significant proportion of this flow is smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap 
map of gdp ppp per-capita with known e-waste dump sites added
the world map shown here illustrates how e-waste dump sites  or sites where citizens or multinational corporations of industrialized nations dump their used electronic devices  along with the
of those countries 
shows an estimated amount of used eee and e-waste imported into kyoto protocol non-annex 1 countries  with the e-waste generated by each country s own domestic supplies 
while gdp ppp per-capita is not a perfect indicator of economic development  and e-waste dump sites are only one small facet of what could be a greater pollution haven  this map does illustrate how e-waste dump sites are often located in poorer  relatively pre-industrial nations  which provides some rudimentary support for the pollution haven hypothesis 
areas of controversy  
the first area of controversy with respect to the pollution haven theory has to do with the formulas above  finding an appropriate measure of regulatory stringency  r  is not simple  because we want to know how much more costly production is in a given jurisdiction relative to others due to that jurisdiction s environmental regulations  the compliance costs stemming from these regulations  however  could come in the form of environmental taxes  regulatory delays  the threat  or execution  of lawsuits  product redesign  or emissions limits  this proliferation of cost styles makes r hard to quantify 
another major critique of the second formula is that it is difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous  so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens  furthermore  governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards  however  as per conventional economic theory  welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin  this does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere  as jurisdictions have different assimilative capacities  costs of abatement  and social attitudes regarding the environment  meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected  by extension  this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise efficiency concerns in an economic sense 
a final area of controversy is whether the pollution haven hypothesis has empirical support  for example  studies have found
evidence that countries with poor air quality do have higher net factor exports of coal  but the magnitude of the impact is small relative to other variables    a winning economist  is skeptical as to whether pollution havens have empirical support in economic theory  as he writes   at this point it s hard to come up with major examples of industries in which the pollution haven phenomenon  to the extent that it occurs  leads to international negative externalities  this does not  however  say that such examples cannot arise in the future  
scale 3 above has had empirical arguments made specifically against it  especially in the last 20 years  some economists argue that once higher environmental standards are introduced in a country  larger multinational firms present in the country are likely to push for enforcement so as to reduce the cost advantage of smaller local firms  this effect would make countries with strict environmental standards a haven for the large companies often associated with higher levels of pollution  meaning the polluting agents may be smaller companies  rather than the larger mncs as theorized by other proponents of the pollution haven hypothesis
