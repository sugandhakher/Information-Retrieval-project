in 1997 a core set of six principles was established by ecological economist
for the sustainability governance of the oceans  these six principles became known as the  lisbon principles   together they provide basic guidelines for administering the use of common natural and social resources 
principle 1  responsibility  access to environmental resources carries attendant responsibilities to use them in an ecologically sustainable  economically efficient  and socially fair manner  individual and corporate responsibilities and incentives should be aligned with each other and with broad social and ecological goals 
principle 2  scale-matching  ecological problems are rarely confined to a single scale  decision-making on environmental resources should  i  be assigned to institutional levels that maximize ecological input   ii  ensure the flow of ecological information between institutional levels   iii  take ownership and actors into account  and  iv  internalize costs and benefits  appropriate scales of governance will be those that have the most relevant information  can respond quickly and efficiently  and are able to integrate across scale boundaries 
principle 3  precaution  in the face of uncertainty about potentially irreversible environmental impacts  decisions concerning their use should err on the side of caution  the burden of proof should shift to those whose activities potentially damage the environment 
principle 4  adaptive management  given that some level of uncertainty always exists in environmental resource management  decision-makers should continuously gather and integrate appropriate ecological  social  and economic information with the goal of adaptive improvement 
principle 5  full cost allocation  all of the internal and external costs and benefits  including social and ecological  of alternative decisions concerning the use of environmental resources should be identified and allocated  when appropriate  markets should be adjusted to reflect full costs 
principle 6  participation  all stakeholders should be engaged in the formulation and implementation of decisions concerning environmental resources  full stakeholder awareness and participation contributes to credible  accepted rules that identify and assign the corresponding responsibilities appropriately
