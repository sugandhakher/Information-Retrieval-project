sustainability accounting  also known as social accounting  social and environmental accounting  corporate social reporting  corporate social responsibility reporting  or non-financial reporting  was originated about 20 years ago and is considered a subcategory of
that focus on the disclosure of non-financial information about a firm s performance to external parties such as capital holders  mainly to stakeholders  creditors and other authorities  these represent the activities that have a direct impact on society  environment  and economic performance of an organisation  sustainability accounting in managerial accounting contrasts with financial accounting in that
is used for internal decision making and the creation of new policies that will have an effect on the organisation s performance at economic  ecological  and social  known as the
or triple-p s    level  the topic is fairly new and being led in europe   
sustainability accounting is a tool used by organisations to become more sustainable  the most known widely used measurements are the corporate sustainability reporting and the triple bottom line accounting  these recognise the role of financial information and shows how traditional
is extended by improving transparency and accountability by reporting on the triple-p s 
as a result of the triple bottom level reporting  and in order to render and guarantee consistency in social and environmental information the gri     was established with the goal to provide guidelines to organisations reporting on sustainability  in some countries guidelines were developed to complement the gri  the gri states that  reporting on economic  environmental and social performance by all organizations is as routine and comparable as financial reporting  
in order to help finance teams and accountants embed sustainability into their accounting  the prince of wales set up the prince s accounting for sustainability project  a4s  in 2004 
scheme of sustainable development  at the confluence of three constituent parts 
contents
history  
the concept of sustainability accounting has emerged from developments in accounting  with roots  in a broader sense over a period of the past forty years  and in the narrow sense  over the past ten years  the development reveals two distinct lines of analysis  the first line is the philosophical debate about accountability  if and how it contributes to sustainable development  and which are the necessary steps towards sustainability  this approach is based on an entirely new system of accounting designed to promote a strategy of sustainability  the second line is the management perspective associated with varied terms and tools towards sustainability  this could be seen as an extension of or modification to conventional financial cost or management accounting  the former may be more appealing  to develop sustainability accounting de novo allows a complete reappraisal of the relative significance of social  environmental and economic benefits and risks and their interactions in corporate accounting systems  p 375376 the development which leads to sustainable accounting could be distinguished in several time periods in which a number of trends were evident  19711980  19811990  19911995 and up to the present  these periods distinguish in volume of empirical studies  normative statements  philosophical discussion  teaching programmes  literature and regulatory frameworks 
19711980  
by the end of the decade has been published a large volume of empirical work and a number of papers referring to the building of models which foster social accounting disclosures  although this early works suffered from problems with subjectivity of analysis as well social and environmental accounting literature  seal  was underdeveloped  information related to the social dimension of accounting have been mostly connected with employees or products  environmental matters were treated as part of a generally undifferentiated and fairly unsophisticated social accounting movement  p 484485 environmental damage included damage to terrain  air  water  noise  visual and aesthetic and other forms of pollution  and solid-waste production  p 486 first ideas about
and mapping of
arose to develop  albeit the contribution of this period was notable for extensive developments in the field of social audit  the methodology was nearly familiar with the historical financial accounting reports  p 487488 at this time neither financial accounting standards nor regulatory frameworks had been developed to any extent  the empirical studies and research were mainly descriptive  although several models and similar normative statements were enhanced  the philosophical debate was not widespread  p 500
19811990  
the first part of the decade showing increased sophistication within the social accounting area and the second part of the decade an apparent transference of interest to environmental accounting  with increasing sign of specialisation in literature  empirical research was more analytical  concerns of social disclosures have been replaced by a concentration on environmental disclosures and regulation as an alternative means of reducing environmental damage  normative statements and model building fostering now the environmental area  in this period the development of teaching programmes about social and environmental accounting issues has its roots  p 490491 despite an increasing use of conceptual frameworks  accounting standards  and legal provisions to reduce the degree of individual interpretation in financial reporting little of this accounting structuration applies to an own appropriate framework of social and environmental accounting  less normative statement have been made  but more articles discussing philosophical matters  p 494495
19911995  
this period was characterised by the almost complete domination of environmental accounting over social accounting  there have also been a number of extensions from environmental disclosures into environmental auditing as well as the development of framework to guide the applications of environmental auditing and in particular the development of environmental management systems  there was still little regulatory framework affecting social and environmental accounting disclosures and conceptual frameworks for accounting do not extend to non-financial quantification and social or environmental issues  the development of a clear regulatory as well conceptual framework is getting closer in several countries  whereas the progress of environmental regulation in the uk and europe was slower than in the united states  canada or australia  the progress was uneven but rapid compared with that in the area of social accounting disclosures  in this times  there have been several textbooks and journal articles covering both social and environmental accounting  however  there has been a relative lack of normative philosophical work within accounting during this period  environmental accounting has not been revived the models of the 1970s and adapted them to the discussions about the valuation of externalities  sustainability and the discussion of the role of management accounting in assisting with sustainable development have become of growing interest  p 496499
1995present  
the convergence of global capital markets and the emergence of global and regional quality control issues  culminating for the accounting profession in the
in 1997/1998 as well the
collapse in 2001  led to a subsequent high-level focus on international and national accounting  p 78 the accounting literature has demonstrated a considerable increase in concern for the issues of sustainable development and accounting  via the exploration of what sustainability accounting may entail  the accounting profession is likely to be involved in re-examining accounting fundamentals in the light of the challenge of sustainable development  several proposals and significant statistical work as well as a growing body of measurement on accounting for sustainable development is being carried out in many international and national settings  p 1 even supra-national policy bodies like the
and the
have sponsored work addressing accounting for sustainability  p 2 p 30 up till now environmental accounting is the most evolved form of sustainability accounting and increasingly processed in the academic circle beginning with the work of
in the early 1990s  and through the release of the sustainability accounting guidelines at the
in 2002  p 78 due to the use of different frameworks and methods much uncertainty remains how this agenda will develop in the future  certain is that the past economic development and the current human  and hence business  activities are not sustainable and has led to questioning the current mode of development  recent years have seen an increasing acceptance and even enthusiasm for these new reporting approaches  also energetic and innovative experimentation by far-sighted organisations have demonstrated that sustainability aspects in accounting and reporting are crucially important  feasible and practicable as well  in this respect  the
 ifac   which objective is to develop the accounting profession and harmonise its standards  today includes 167 member bodies in over 127 countries and represents approximately over two million accountants worldwide 
in 2004  hrh the prince of wales set up his accounting for sustainability project  a4s  to  help ensure that we are not battling to meet 21st century challenges with  at best  20th century decision-making and reporting systems   a4s convenes leaders in the finance and accounting communities to catalyse a fundamental shift towards resilient business models and a sustainable economy  a4s has two global networks  the accounting bodies network  abn  whose members comprise approximately two thirds of the world s accountants and the a4s cfo leadership network  a group of cfos from leading companies seeking to transform finance and accounting 
methodology  
sustainability accounting has increased in popularity in the last couple of decades  many companies are adopting new methods and techniques in their financial disclosure and information about the core activities and the impact that these have on the environment  as a result of this  stakeholders  suppliers and governmental institutions want a better understanding of how companies manage their resources to achieve their goals to accomplish sustainable development 
according to common definitions there are three key dimension of sustainability  every dimension focuses on different subsets 
environmental factors
social
economic
and non hazardous waste
community investment
and
anticorruption
 
value
economic performance
financial performance
sustainability accounting connects the companies  strategies from a sustainable framework by disclosing information on the three dimensional levels environment  economical and social   in practice  however  it is difficult to put together policies that promote simultaneously environmental  economic and social goals 
this trend has made companies not to emphasize in the creation of value but also in the risk mitigation that are linked to the environmental and social subset of sustainable development  this development has been driven by multiple factors connected to 
sustainability issues that materially affect a company s creation of value  risk and liabilities
the need for business to appropriately respond to sustainable growth 
reporting formats  
the concept of sustainability accounting is being carried out in an international setting with a vast and growing level of experience in the measurement of sustainable development  it recognises the role of financial information and shows how this can be extended to the social and environmental level  although there isn t an established framework of reporting the content of a company s report can be largely determined by factors and reporting standards  guidelines and regulations  this trend offers companies a greater flexibility than financial statements  but an effective report needs to deliver information aligned to the company s overall objectives and engage with the audience in a manner that promotes the exchange of ideas and communication 
nowadays  there are several ways and mechanisms of reporting  such as assurance statements  environmental  social and economic performance reports that have been noted  some of these reports include shorter and more concise reports  some companies are including in their reports a combination of hard copies and online resources as well as downloadable pdf files  some examples can be found at the gri  which is the most popular framework for companies that are looking for help and assistance in how to create their sustainability report  as the trend to produce sustainability reports increases  so too do the guidelines and frameworks to report on the social environmental information 
frameworks  
sustainability accounting continues to develop  it is therefore of importance that companies understand the scenery of reporting frameworks  standards and guidelines that may affect the form and content of their reports  there are several organisations that offer services to companies that want to change the traditional financial statement disclosure for sustainability reporting 
in mostly all countries around the world  there are currently no governmental requirements for companies to prepare and publish sustainability reports  companies that have started to adopt this new method of reporting have faced new challenges in reporting due to the lack of experience  failing to report accordingly to the guidelines and frameworks provided  see oecd and gri  would lead them to potentially reduce their credibility of published information 
the gri  oecd and uncsd   are some of the main actors in integrating a policy framework for better integrating the three dimensional level of sustainability by decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures 
the gri is a multi-stakeholder organization that is committed to developing and maintaining the  sustainability reporting guidelines   the goal is the continuous improvement of sustainability reporting  this is only a protocol that approaches the application levels  there are three levels of reporting a  b and c  but these are not yet legally ratified fundamentals and are only used to assist companies with their sustainable reports 
on the one hand the uncsd focuses only on the environmental dimension of the sustainability accounting 
on the other hand  the oecd  organization for economic co-operation and development  focuses only in two frameworks  p 2 the analytical and accounting frameworks 
analytical frameworks  
analytical frameworks are important for linking information from different areas  various types of frameworks are being used nowadays depending on the purpose of measurement  these frameworks seek to 
integrate the economic  environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development
have sound foundations and to maintain key information needed to improve sustainable development measurements
clarify relationships between different indicators and policies 
some examples of analytical frameworks are  pressure  state  response  psr  model which is based on one of its variants driving force  pressure  state  impact  response used by the european environment agency  eea  or the driving force  state  response  p 1
accounting frameworks  
in the other hand the accounting frameworks seek to quantify information in the three dimensions of sustainability accounting  the system of national accounts  sna  has proven that measuring sustainable development with the conventional system of financial reporting is inadequate  p 2 the accounting structure imposes a more systematic approach that is not too flexible in comparison to the standards and frameworks that offer the gri and oecd among others  accounting for sustainability therefore requires an extension of its standard framework  the oecd offers two different approaches to the accounting framework for sustainability accounting 
measuring environmental-economic-social interrelationships
wealth-based approaches
measuring environmental-economic-social interrelationships needs a clear understanding of the relationships that exists between the natural environment and the economy  it is not possible without understanding the physical representation  the physical flow accounts are helpful in showing the characteristics of production and consumption activities  some of these accounts focus on the physical exchange between the economic system and natural environment 
wealth-based approaches to sustainability refer to the preservation of stock of wealth  sustainability is observed as the maintenance of the capital base of a country and therefore potentially measured  a number of environmental changes are contained also in these financial statements that are measured during an accounting period of time 
the gri offers advanced material to help organisations of all types to create their accountability reports  this published material lead organisations through the reporting process with main idea of becoming more sustainable in their practices in everyday business 
organisations and initiatives

summary and outlook  
nevertheless  the development of regulatory frameworks is getting closer in several countries  accountants will need to broaden their knowledge and to establish a common dialogue with social and ecological professionals  the formation of independent
sustainability teams to prepare and audit sustainability accounts would add credibility to the process  p 24
like the sections above illustrated sustainable accounting resulted in different interpretations and intended uses of accounting  the development of a pragmatic set of tools for corporate practice is to progress  future research needs to address the real challenge to corporate management to develop pragmatic tools for a well described set of business situations  this need to address the decision and control needs of corporate managers  whether the case they are responsible for environmental  social or economic issues associated with corporate activities  the
and complementary situations need to be identified  analysed and accounting that provides a basis for movement towards corporate and general sustainability developed  p 383
it is to recognise that to fall short of a convincing conceptualization will leave sustainability accounting as a broad umbrella term  with little practical usefulness  the linkage between sustainability accounting and sustainability reporting needs to be extended as well  in this context  sustainability reporting as well remains at an unfinished stage of development and at present is still more of a buzzword than a well defined approach  the debate remains open to challenge this goal on the premise of sustainability  its operationalisation and its accountings 
in view of these aspects geoff lamberton provides a promising framework for the various forms of accounting  it draws together the five general mayor themes evident in social and environmental accounting research and practice  including the gri sustainability accounting guidelines  he depicts a comprehensive sustainability accounting framework which displays the complex interconnections between the various components and dimensions of sustainability  it balances the need for integration of the variety in information  measurements and reporting with the differentiated unitary information effects between the dimensions of sustainable development  the multiple units of measurement include narratives of social policy and procedures as well traditional accounting principles and practice 
components of goeff lambertons comprehensive sustainability accounting framework 
assumptions underpinning the specification of this framework are 
the objective s  of the sustainability accounting framework and the reporting model 
the principles underpinning the application of the model 
techniques like data capture tools  accounting records and measurements 
reports used to present information to stakeholders 
and qualitative attributes of the information produced and reported  p  1617
it is unrealistic to expect business to voluntarily commit the resources required for full sustainable accounting implementation  for financing the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting one option would be to use environmental taxes to raise revenue and to discourage negative environmental impacts  once the sustainability accounting system is established tax rates could be linked to  sustainability  performance outcomes to encourage the transition to sustainability at the organizational level  p 24
a promising trail in similar way may be the concept of the community welfare economics  german    by   more like a framework for sustainability accounting it is a framework or an alternative way of economics and the society in general  it suggests that business should measure its contributions of economic success according to the benefits reimbursed to the society as social and ecological factors  similar to tax principles  the business performance is specified by an accounts of points  representing the contributions to overall well-being  and therefore the company receive  tax  benefits or support in other various form  or even not 
a further interesting example is provided by the sustainability flower which was developed in 2009 by an international group of prominent pioneers and innovators of the organic movement  the flowers performance indicators were defined on the basis of the gri guidelines and looks to unite four dimensions of sustainability  economic life  societal life  cultural life and ecology with six sub dimensions  in a model 
a further promising approach toward the measurement of human  social and natural capital including environmental quality  health  security  equity  education and free time is made by the buddhist foundation and the bhutan government toward operationalising the objective of   these innovative projects may demonstrate that an alternative cultural perspective is needed as well to inform an accounting that is capable of making a genuine contribution to sustainability  the future direction of sustainability accounting and sustain economic development should continue to display the essential quality of diversity  humankind has much to lose if this transition does not take place
