lignocellulose refers to plant dry matter     so called lignocellulosic biomass  it is the most abundantly available raw material on the
for the production of   mainly   it is composed of carbohydrate polymers       and an aromatic polymer     these carbohydrate polymers contain different sugar monomers  six and five carbon sugars  and they are tightly bound to lignin  lignocellulosic biomass can be broadly classified into virgin biomass  waste biomass and energy crops  virgin biomass includes all naturally occurring terrestrial plants such as trees  bushes and grass  waste biomass is produced as a low value byproduct of various industrial sectors such as
   sugarcane   straw etc   and
  and
discards  
are crops with high yield of lignocellulosic biomass produced to serve as a raw material for production of second generation biofuel  examples include switch grass    and

dedicated energy crops  
many crops are of interest for their ability to provide high yields of biomass and can be harvested multiple times each year  these include
trees and   the premier energy crop is   which is a source of the readily fermentable
and the lignocellulosic by-product

lignocellulosic biomass is the feedstock for the   this energy-intensive industry focuses on the separation of the lignin and cellulosic fractions of the biomass 
biofuels  
lignocellulosic biomass  in the form of   has a long history as a source of energy  since the middle of the 20th century  the interest of biomass as a precursor to liquid fuels has increased  to be specific  the
of lignocellulosic biomass to
is an attractive route to fuels that supplements the   biomass is a carbon-neutral source of energy  since it comes from plants  the combustion of lignocellulosic ethanol produces no net carbon dioxide into the   aside from ethanol  many other lignocellulose-derived fuels are of potential interest  including     and  
one barrier to the production of ethanol from biomass is that the sugars necessary for fermentation are trapped inside the lignocellulose  lignocellulose has evolved to resist degradation and to confer
stability and structural robustness to the cell walls of the plants  this robustness or  recalcitrance  is attributable to the crosslinking between the polysaccharides  cellulose and hemicellulose  and the lignin via
and
linkages  ester linkages arise between oxidized sugars  the   and the phenols and phenylpropanols functionalities of the lignin  to extract the fermentable sugars  one must first disconnect the celluloses from the lignin  and then use acid or enzymatic methods to
the newly freed celluloses to break them down into simple monosaccharides  another challenge to biomass fermentation is the high percentage of pentoses in the hemicellulose  such as   or wood sugar  unlike hexoses such as glucose  pentoses are difficult to ferment  the problems presented by the lignin and hemicellulose fractions are the foci of much contemporary research 
a large sector of research into the exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for bio-ethanol focuses particularly on the fungus   known for its cellulolytic abilities  multiple avenues are being explored including the design of an optimised cocktail of cellulases and hemicellulases isolated from t  reesei  as well as genetic-engineering-based strain improvement to allow the fungus to simply be placed in the presence of lignocellulosic biomass and break down the matter into
  strain improvement methods have led to strains capable of producing significantly more cellulases than the original qm6a isolate  certain industrial strains are known to produce up to 100g of cellulase per litre of fungus thus allowing for maximal extraction of sugars from lignocellulosic biomass  these sugars can then be fermented  leading to bio-ethanol
