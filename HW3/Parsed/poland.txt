writes  all in all  the polish units  although divided and controlled by different political orientation  constituted the fourth largest allied force  after the america  british and soviet armies  
has noted that  if polish forces fighting in the east and west were added to the resistance fighters  poland had the fourth largest allied army in the war  after the ussr  the u s  and britain   
the claim of the fourth biggest ally needs to be reconsidered  however  throughout the war  poland s position varied from the 2nd biggest ally  after the   when polish army outnumbered the french  to perhaps the 5th at the end of it  after the us  soviet union  china and britain   please see the analysis in  
c 
sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement during world war ii  the confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed  some resistance movements grew larger  and other diminished  polish territories were mostly freed from nazi german control in the years 194445  eliminating the need for their respective  anti-nazi  partisan forces in poland  although the

wrote  home army  armia krajowa or ak  in late 1943 numbered around 400000  making it the largest resistance organization in europe  
wrote  armia krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime europe   certainly  polish resistance was the largest resistance till german
