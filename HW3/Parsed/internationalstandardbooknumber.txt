the international standard book number  isbn  is a unique numeric commercial
 
an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation  except reprintings  of a book  for example  an   a
and a
edition of the same book would each have a different isbn  the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007  and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007  the method of assigning an isbn is nation-based and varies from country to country  often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country 
the initial isbn configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 based upon the 9-digit standard book numbering  sbn  created in 1966  the 10-digit isbn format was developed by the
 iso  and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108  the sbn code can be converted to a ten digit isbn by prefixing it with a zero  
occasionally  a book may appear without a printed isbn if it is printed privately or the author does not follow the usual isbn procedure  however  this can be rectified later

history  
the standard book numbering  sbn 
is a 9-digit commercial
system created by   emeritus professor of statistics at   for the booksellers and stationers
and others in 1965  the isbn configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 by david whitaker  regarded as the  father of the isbn   and emery koltay  who later became director of the   
the 10-digit isbn format was developed by the
 iso  and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108  the united kingdom continued to use the 9-digit sbn code until 1974  iso has appointed the international isbn agency as the registration authority for isbn worldwide and the isbn standard is developed under the control of iso technical committee 46 subcommittee 9   the
on-line facility only refers back to 1978 
an sbn may be converted to an isbn by prefixing the digit  0   for example  the second edition of   published by hodder in 1965  has  sbn 340 01381 8  - 340 indicating the publisher  01381 their serial number  and 8 being the check digit  this can be converted to   the check digit does not need to be re-calculated 
since 1 january 2007  isbns have contained 13 digits  a format that is compatible with    european article number -13s 
overview  
an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation  except reprintings  of a book  for example  an ebook  a paperback  and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different isbn  the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007  and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007  an international standard book number consists of 4 parts  if it is a 10 digit isbn  or 5 parts  for a 13 digit isbn  
the parts of a 10-digit isbn and the corresponding ean13 and barcode  note the different check digits in each  the part of the ean13 labeled  ean  is the
country code 
for a 13-digit isbn  a prefix element  a

the publication element  and
a
character or  
a 13-digit isbn can be separated into its parts  prefix element  registration group  registrant  publication and check digit   and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with
or spaces  separating the parts  registration group  registrant  publication and check digit  of a 10-digit isbn is also done with either hyphens or spaces  figuring out how to correctly separate a given isbn number is complicated  because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits 
how isbns are issued  
isbn issuance is country-specific  in that isbns are issued by the isbn registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language  the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned  and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number  type  and size of publishers that are active  some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services  in other cases  the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded  in canada  isbns are issued at no cost with the stated purpose of encouraging canadian culture  in the united kingdom  united states  and some other countries  where the service is provided by non-government-funded organisations  the issuing of isbns requires payment of a fee 
australia  isbns are issued by the commercial library services agency thorpe-bowker  and prices range from  42 for a single isbn  plus a  55 registration fee for new publishers  to  2,890 for a block of 1,000 isbns  access is immediate when requested via their website 
brazil    a government agency  is responsible for issuing isbns  and there is a cost of r 16
canada    a government agency  is responsible for issuing isbns  and there is no cost  works in french are issued an isbn by the  
colombia    a ngo  is responsible for issuing isbns  cost of issuing an isbn is about usd 20 
india  the raja rammohun roy national agency for isbn book promotion and copyright division   under department of higher education  a constituent of the   is responsible for registration of indian publishers  authors  universities  institutions  and government departments that are responsible for publishing books 
italy  the privately held company ediser srl  owned by associazione italiana editori  italian publishers association  is responsible for issuing isbns  the original national prefix 978-88 is reserved for publishing companies  starting at 49 for a ten-codes block while a new prefix 979-12 is dedicated to self-publishing authors  at a fixed price of 25 for a single code

united states  in the united states  the privately held company
issues isbns  there is a charge that varies depending upon the number of isbns purchased  with prices starting at  125.00 for a single number  access is immediate when requested via their website 
publishers and authors in other countries obtain isbns from their respective national isbn registration agency  a directory of isbn agencies is available on the
website 
registration group identifier  
the
is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element  i e  one of 978 or 979   registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element  the single-digit group identifiers within the 978 prefix element are  0 or 1 for english-speaking countries  2 for french-speaking countries  3 for german-speaking countries  4 for japan  5 for russian-speaking countries  and 7 for people s republic of china  an example 5-digit group identifier is 99936  for   the allocated group ids are  05  600621  7  8094  950989  99269989  and 9990199976  books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers 
within the 979 prefix element  the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with
 ismns   but such material is not actually assigned an isbn  the registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for france  11 for the republic of korea  and 12 for italy 
the original 9-digit standard book number  sbn  had no registration group identifier  but prefixing a zero  0  to a 9-digit sbn creates a valid 10-digit isbn 
registrant element  
the national isbn agency assigns the registrant element     and an accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher  the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of its books  in most countries  a book publisher is not required by law to assign an isbn  however  most book stores only handle isbn bearing merchandise   
a listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published  and can be ordered in book form  1399  1959   the web site of the isbn agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes  partial lists have been compiled  from library catalogs  for the english-language groups 
and  
publishers receive blocks of isbns  with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them  a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier  several digits for the registrant  and a single digit for the publication element  once that block of isbns is used  the publisher may receive another block of isbns  with a different registrant element  consequently  a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements  there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country  this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers 
by using variable block lengths  registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers  for example  a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element  likewise  countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements  here are some sample isbn-10 codes  illustrating block length variations

check digits  
a
is a form of redundancy check used for   the decimal equivalent of a binary   it consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number  the method for the ten digit code is an extension of that for sbns  the two systems are compatible  and sbn prefixed with  0  will give the same check-digit as without - the digit is base eleven  and can be 0-9 or x  the system for thirteen digit codes is not compatible and will  in general  give a different check digit from the corresponding 10 digit isbn  and does not provide the same protection against transposition  this is because the thirteen digit code was required to be compatible with the ean format  and hence could not contain an  x  
isbn-10 check digits  
the 2001 edition of the official manual of the
says that the isbn-10  which is the last digit of the ten-digit isbn must range from 0 to 10  the symbol x is used for 10   and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits  each multiplied by its  integer  weight  descending from 10 to 1  is a multiple of  
for example  for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-2

the two most common errors in handling an isbn  e g   typing or writing it  are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits  it can be
that all possible valid isbn-10 s have at least two digits different from each other  it can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid isbn-10 s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits   these are true only because the isbn is less than 11 digits long  and because 11 is a    the isbn check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error  i e  if either of these types of error has occurred  the result will never be a valid isbn the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11  however  if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected  the book will be issued with an invalid isbn 
in contrast  it is possible for other types of error  such as two altered non-transposed digits  or three altered digits  to result in a valid isbn number  although it is still unlikely  
isbn-10 check digit calculation  
is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11  each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit isbnexcluding the check digit itselfis multiplied by a number in a sequence from 10 to 2  and the remainder of the sum  with respect to 11  is computed  the resulting remainder  plus the check digit  must equal a multiple of 11  either 0 or 11   therefore  the check digit is  11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11  modulo 11  taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0  without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11  0   11 which is invalid   strictly speaking the first  modulo 11  is unneeded  but it may be considered to simplify the calculation  
for example  the check digit for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-  is calculated as follows 
s

thus the check digit is 2  and the complete sequence is isbn 0-306-40615-2  the value

required to satisfy this condition might be 10  if so  an  x  should be used 
it is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators  repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples

the modular reduction can be done once at the end  as shown above  in which case s could hold a value as large as 496  for the invalid isbn 99999-999-9-x   or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition 
isbn-13 check digit calculation  
the 2005 edition of the international isbn agency s official manual describes how the 13-digit isbn
is calculated  the isbn-13 check digit  which is the last digit of the isbn  must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits  each multiplied by its  integer  weight  alternating between 1 and 3  is a multiple of

the calculation of an isbn-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit isbn  thus excluding the check digit itself   each digit  from left to right  is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3  then those products are summed
10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9  subtracted from 10  that leaves a result from 1 to 10  a zero  0  replaces a ten  10   so  in all cases  a single check digit results 
for example  the isbn-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-  is calculated as follows 
s   91   73   81   03   31   03   61   43   01   63   11   53

thus  the check digit is 7  and the complete sequence is isbn 978-0-306-40615-7

check digit formula does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition  specifically  if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5  the check digit will not catch their transposition  for instance  the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1  the correct order contributes 36 11   19 to the sum  while  if the digits are transposed  1 followed by a 6   the contribution of those two digits will be 31 16   9  however  19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10  and so produce the same  final result  both isbns will have a check digit of 7  the isbn-10 formula uses the
modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot  but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit 
additionally  if the sum of the 2nd  4th  6th  8th  10th  and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits  1st  3rd  5th  7th  9th  11th  and 13th   the total will always be divisible by 10  i e   end in 0  
isbn-10 to isbn-13 conversion  
the conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix  978  to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the isbn-13 algorithm 
errors in usage  
publishers and
have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit  publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its isbn before publishing it  that failure causes book identification problems for libraries  booksellers  and readers  for example 
is shared by two books  ninja gaiden  a novel based on the best-selling game by tecmo  1990  and wacky laws  1997   both published by  
most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher  the
catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns  which it usually tags with the phrase  cancelled isbn   however  book-ordering systems such as
will not search for a book if an invalid isbn is entered to its search engine   
often indexes by invalid isbns  if the book is indexed in that way by a member library 
eisbn  
only the term  isbn  should be used  the terms  eisbn  and  e-isbn  have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided  if a book exists in one or more digital    formats  each of those formats must have its own isbn  in other words  each of the three separate     and
formats of a particular book will have its own specific isbn  they should not share the isbn of the paper version  and there is no generic  eisbn  which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title 
ean format used in barcodes  and upgrading  
currently the
on a book s back cover  or inside a mass-market
book s front cover  are   they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the
and the   for 10 digit isbns  the number  978   the
 country code   is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data  and the check digit is recalculated according to the ean13 formula  modulo 10  1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits  
partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories  the
 iso  decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit isbn  isbn-13   the process began 1 january 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 january 2007  as of 2011  all the 13-digit isbns began with 978  as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted  the 979 prefix was introduced  part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the
code for
with an   10 digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an  m  letter  the bar code represents the  m  as a zero  0   and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3  all ismns are now 13 digits commencing 979-0  979-1 to 979-9 will be used by isbn 
publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns  likewise  there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same  moreover  the ten-digit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit isbn check digit  because the gtin-13 is part of the
 gtin  system  that includes the gtin-14  the gtin-12  and the gtin-8   the 13-digit isbn falls within the 14-digit data field range 
barcode format compatibility is maintained  because  aside from the group breaks  the isbn-13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing 10-digit isbns  so  migration to an ean-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing isbn based data  with only minimal changes to
systems  hence  many
 e g     migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005  although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read ean-13 barcodes before 2005  most general retailers could not read them  the upgrading of the
to full ean-13  in 2005  eased migration to the isbn-13 in north america
