pressurized water reactor
 this section has recently been translated from the german wikipedia  
the conversion to electrical energy takes place indirectly  as in conventional thermal power stations  the fission in a nuclear reactor heats the reactor coolant  the coolant may be
or
or even
depending on the type of reactor  the reactor coolant then goes to a
and heats water to produce steam  the pressurized steam is then usually fed to a multi-stage   after the steam turbine has expanded and partially condensed the steam  the remaining vapor is condensed in a condenser  the condenser is a heat exchanger which is connected to a secondary side such as a river or a   the water is then pumped back into the steam generator and the cycle begins again  the water-steam cycle corresponds to the  
nuclear reactors  
main article 
the nuclear reactor is the heart of the station  in its central part  the reactor core s heat is generated by controlled nuclear fission  with this heat  a coolant is heated as it is pumped through the reactor and thereby removes the energy from the reactor  heat from nuclear fission is used to raise steam  which runs through   which in turn powers the electrical generators 
nuclear reactors usually rely on uranium to fuel the chain reaction  uranium is a very heavy metal that is abundant on earth and is found in sea water as well as most rocks  naturally occurring uranium is found in two different isotopes  uranium-238  u-238   accounting for 99.3  and uranium-235  u-235  accounting for about 0.7   isotopes are atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons  thus  u-238 has 146 neutrons and u-235 has 143 neutrons  different isotopes have different behaviors  for instance  u-235 is fissile which means that it is easily split and gives off a lot of energy making it ideal for nuclear energy  on the other hand  u-238 does not have that property despite it being the same element  different isotopes also have different half-lives  a half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive element to decay  u-238 has a longer half-life than u-235  so it takes longer to decay over time  this also means that u-238 is less radioactive than u-235 
since nuclear fission creates radioactivity  the reactor core is surrounded by a protective shield  this containment absorbs radiation and prevents
from being released into the environment  in addition  many reactors are equipped with a dome of concrete to protect the reactor against both internal casualties and external impacts 
steam turbine  
main article 
the purpose of the steam turbine is to convert the heat contained in steam into mechanical energy  the engine house with the steam turbine is usually structurally separated from the main reactor building  it is so aligned to prevent debris from the destruction of a turbine in operation from flying towards the reactor   
in the case of a pressurized water reactor  the steam turbine is separated from the nuclear system  to detect a leak in the steam generator and thus the passage of radioactive water at an early stage  an activity meter is mounted to track the outlet steam of the steam generator  in contrast  boiling water reactors pass radioactive water through the steam turbine  so the turbine is kept as part of the radiologically controlled area of the nuclear power station 
generator  
main article 
the generator converts mechanical power supplied by the turbine into electrical power  low-pole ac synchronous generators of high rated power are used 
cooling system  
a cooling system removes heat from the reactor core and transports it to another area of the station  where the thermal energy can be harnessed to produce electricity or to do other useful work  typically the hot coolant is used as a heat source for a   and the pressurized steam from that drives one or more
driven  
safety valves  
in the event of an emergency  safety valves can be used to prevent pipes from bursting or the reactor from exploding  the valves are designed so that they can derive all of the supplied flow rates with little increase in pressure  in the case of the bwr  the steam is directed into the suppression chamber and condenses there  the chambers on a heat exchanger are connected to the intermediate cooling circuit 
feedwater pump  
the water level in the steam generator and nuclear reactor is controlled using the feedwater system  the feedwater pump has the task of taking the water from the condensate system  increasing the pressure and forcing it into either the steam generators  in the case of a pressurized water reactor  or directly into the reactor  for boiling water reactors  
emergency power supply  
most nuclear stations require two distinct sources of offsite power feeding station service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the stations s switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines  in addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station s house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars before they reach the step-up transformer  these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard   even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible  nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power 
workers in a nuclear power station  
resident inspectors
in the united states and canada  workers except for management  professional  such as engineers  and security personnel are likely to be members of either the
 ibew  or the
 uwua   or one of the various trades and labor unions representing machinist  laborers  boilermakers  millwrights  iron workers etc   
economics  
main article 
the   the
in the world
the economics of new nuclear power stations is a controversial subject  and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source  nuclear power stations typically have high capital costs  but low direct fuel costs  with the costs of fuel extraction  processing  use and   therefore  comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear stations  cost estimates take into account
and
storage or recycling costs in the united states due to the   with the prospect that all   nuclear waste  could potentially be recycled by using future reactors 
are being designed to completely close the   presently  however there has not yet been any actual bulk recycling of waste from a npp  and on-site temporary storage is still being used at almost all plant sites due to waste
construction problems  only finland has stable repository plans  therefore from a world-wide perspective  long-term waste storage costs are uncertain 
nuclear reactors in operation releasing hot steam as a side product
on the other hand  construction  or capital cost aside  measures to
such as a
or   increasingly favor the economics of nuclear power  further efficiencies are hoped to be achieved through more advanced reactor designs 
promise to be at least 17  more fuel efficient  and have lower capital costs  while futuristic
promise 10000-30000  greater fuel efficiency and the elimination of nuclear waste 
in eastern europe  a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance  notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania  and some potential backers have pulled out  where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure  this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects 
analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties  to date all operating nuclear power stations were developed by
or
where many of the risks associated with construction costs  operating performance  fuel price  and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers  many countries have now liberalized the
where these risks  and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered  are borne by station suppliers and operators rather than consumers  which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power stations 
following the 2011   costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power stations  due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats  however many designs  such as the currently under construction ap1000  use
cooling systems  unlike those of
which required active cooling systems  this largely eliminates the necessity to spend more on redundant back up safety equipment 
safety and accidents  
main articles 
and
in his book   
says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society s complex and tightly-coupled nuclear reactor systems  such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around  an interdisciplinary team from mit has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005  2055  at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period  however the mit study does not take into account improvements in safety since 1970  to date  there have been five serious accidents    in the world since 1970  one at
in 1979  one at
in 1986  and three at
in 2011   corresponding to the beginning of the operation of   this leads to on average one serious accident happening every eight years worldwide   
nuclear power plants cannot explode like a
because the fuel for uranium reactors is not
enough  and nuclear weapons require precision explosives to force fuel into a small enough volume to go supercritical  most reactors require continuous temperature control to prevent a   which has occurred on a few occasions through accident or natural disaster  releasing radiation and making the surrounding area uninhabitable  modern nuclear reactor designs however  have had numerous safety improvements since the first generation nuclear reactors  plants must be defended against theft of nuclear material  for example to make a   and attack by enemy military  which has occurred  planes or missiles  or planes hijacked by terrorists 
controversy  
main article 
the abandoned city of   following the   the chernobyl nuclear power station is in the background 
the nuclear power debate is about the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and use of
to generate
from
for civilian purposes  the debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s  when it  reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies   in some countries 
proponents argue that
is a
source which reduces
and can increase
if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels  proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution  in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel  proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most western countries  they emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors  and the operational safety record in the western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants 
opponents say that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment  these threats include health risks and environmental damage from   processing and transport  the risk of
or sabotage  and the unsolved problem of radioactive   the environment issue is also regarding discharge of hot water into the sea  the hot water modifies the environmental conditions for the marine flora fauna  they also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong  and there have been many serious   critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new   they argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the
are considered  from uranium mining to   nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source 
reprocessing  
main article 
nuclear reprocessing technology was developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel  reprocessing serves multiple purposes  whose relative importance has changed over time  originally reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing   with the commercialization of   the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into
for   the   which constitutes the bulk of the spent fuel material  can in principle also be re-used as fuel  but that is only economic when uranium prices are high or disposal is expensive  finally  the
can employ not only the recycled plutonium and uranium in spent fuel  but all the   closing the
and potentially multiplying the
extracted from
by more than 60 times 
nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste  but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository  reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to   the potential vulnerability to   the political challenges of repository siting  a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel   and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle  in the united states  the obama administration stepped back from president bush s plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research 
accident indemnification  
the
puts in place an international framework for nuclear liability  however states with a majority of the world s nuclear power stations  including the u s   russia  china and japan  are not party to international nuclear liability conventions 
in the u s   insurance for
or radiological incidents is covered  for facilities licensed through 2025  by the  
under the
through its nuclear installations act of 1965  liability is governed for nuclear damage for which a uk nuclear licensee is responsible  the act requires compensation to be paid for damage up to a limit of 150 million by the liable operator for ten years after the incident  between ten and thirty years afterwards  the government meets this obligation  the government is also liable for additional limited cross-border liability  about 300 million  under international conventions   and brussels convention supplementary to the paris convention  
decommissioning  
main article 
nuclear decommissioning is the dismantling of a nuclear power station and decontamination of the site to a state no longer requiring protection from radiation for the general public  the main difference from the dismantling of other power stations is the presence of
material that requires special precautions to remove and safely relocate to a waste repository 
warranty period of operation of nuclear power stations is 30 years  one of the
factors is the
under the action of neutron bombardment 
generally speaking  nuclear stations were designed for a life of about 30years  newer stations are designed for a 40 to 60-year operating life 
decommissioning involves many administrative and technical actions  it includes all clean-up of radioactivity and progressive demolition of the station  once a facility is decommissioned  there should no longer be any danger of a radioactive accident or to any persons visiting it  after a facility has been completely decommissioned it is released from regulatory control  and the licensee of the station no longer has responsibility for its nuclear safety 
historic accidents  
main article 
the 2011
in japan  the worst
  displaced 50,000 households after
leaked into the air  soil and sea  radiation checks led to bans of some shipments of vegetables and fish 
the nuclear industry says that new technology and oversight have made nuclear station much safer  but
have occurred since the
in 1986 until 2008  two thirds of these mishaps occurred in the us  the french atomic energy agency  cea  has concluded that technical innovation cannot eliminate the risk of human errors in nuclear station operation   
according to   an interdisciplinary team from mit in 2003 estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005  2055  at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period  however the mit study does not take into account improvements in safety since 1970 
flexibility of nuclear power stations  
nuclear stations are used primarily for base load because of economic considerations  the fuel cost of operations for a nuclear station is smaller than the fuel cost for operation of coal or gas plants  there is no cost saving if you run a nuclear station at less than full capacity   
however  nuclear stations are routinely used in load following mode on a large scale in france  although  it is generally accepted that this is not an ideal economic situation for nuclear stations   unita at the german
is designed to in- and decrease its output 15  per minute between 40 and 100  of its nominal power  boiling water reactors normally have load-following capability  implemented by varying the recirculation water flow   
future power stations  
a new generation of designs for nuclear power stations  known as the   are the subject of active research  many of these new designs specifically attempt to make fission reactors cleaner  safer and or less of a risk to the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
stations  such as the   are available to be built and other reactors that are designed to be nearly fool-proof are being pursued    which are still in the early stages of development  diminish or eliminate some of the risks associated with nuclear fission 
two 1600
 eprs  are being built in europe  and two are being built in china  the reactors are a joint effort of french
and german   and will be the largest reactors in the world  one epr is in     as part of the   the reactor was originally scheduled to go online in 2009  but has been repeatedly delayed  and as of september 2014 has been pushed back to 2018  preparatory work for the epr at the

in     the taishan reactors were scheduled to go online in 2014 and 2015  but that has been delayed to 2017 
as of march 2007  there are seven nuclear power stations under construction in   and five in  
in november 2011 gulf power stated that by the end of 2012 it hopes to finish buying off 4000 acres of land north of pensacola  florida in order to build a possible nuclear power station 
in 2010 russia launched a   the 100 million vessel  the   is the first of seven stations that will bring vital energy resources to remote russian regions
