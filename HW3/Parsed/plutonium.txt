physical properties
plutonium  like most metals  has a bright silvery appearance at first  much like   but it
very quickly to a dull gray  although yellow and olive green are also reported  at room temperature plutonium is in its   this  the most common structural form of the element     is about as hard and brittle as
unless it is
with other metals to make it soft and ductile  unlike most metals  it is not a good conductor of
or   it has a low
 640c  and an unusually high
 3,228c  
  the release of a high-energy
nucleus  is the most common form of
for plutonium  a 5kg mass of 239pu contains about 702512500000000000012.51024 atoms  with a half-life of 24,100 years  about 701311500000000000011.51012 of its atoms decay each second by emitting a 5.157 alpha particle  this amounts to 9.68 watts of power  heat produced by the deceleration of these alpha particles makes it warm to the touch 
is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of   the resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal  and it gets even higher with lower temperatures  which is unusual for metals  this trend continues down to 100  below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples  resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20k due to radiation damage  with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample 
because of self-irradiation  a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure  meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time  self-irradiation can also lead to
which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100k 
unlike most materials  plutonium increases in density when it melts  by 2.5   but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature  near the melting point  the liquid plutonium has also very high
and

allotropes
main article 
plutonium has six allotropes at ambient pressure  alpha    beta    gamma    delta    deltaprime       epsilon  
plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh  zeta    at high temperature within a limited pressure range  these allotropes  which are different structural modifications or forms of an element  have very similar
but significantly varying
and   this makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature  pressure  or chemistry  and allows for dramatic volume changes following
from one allotropic form to another  the densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00g cm3 to 19.86g cm3 
the presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult  as it changes state very readily  for example  the  form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium  it has machining characteristics similar to
but changes to the plastic and malleable   beta  form at slightly higher temperatures  the reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood  the  form has a low-symmetry
structure  hence its brittleness  strength  compressibility  and poor thermal conductivity 
plutonium in the   delta  form normally exists in the 310c to 452c range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of     or   enhancing workability and allowing it to be   the  form has more typical metallic character  and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium  in fission weapons  the explosive
used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual  phase plutonium to the denser  form  significantly helping to achieve   the  phase  the highest temperature solid allotrope  exhibits anomalously high atomic
compared to other elements 
nuclear fission

plutonium is a radioactive
metal whose     is one of the three primary
isotopes   and
are the other two  
is also highly fissile  to be considered fissile  an isotope s
must be able to break apart or
when struck by a
and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the
by splitting further nuclei 
pure plutonium-239 may have a
 keff  larger than one  which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry  e g   a sphere of sufficient size   it can form a   during fission  a fraction of the   which holds a nucleus together  is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy  much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy   fission of a kilogram of plutonium-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to 21,000
 88,000   it is this energy that makes plutonium-239 useful in
and  
the presence of the isotope
in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential  as plutonium-240 has a relatively high
rate   440 fissions per second per gramover 1,000 neutrons per second per gram   raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of   plutonium is identified as either   fuel-grade  or reactor-grade based on the percentage of plutonium-240 that it contains  weapons-grade plutonium contains less than 7  plutonium-240

the isotopes of plutonium range in
from 228 to 247  the primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope  plutonium-244  are spontaneous fission and   mostly forming uranium  92   and

electronic structure
plutonium is an element in which the
are the transition border between delocalized and localized  it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements  the anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure  the energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low  the size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice  on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior  the proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels  this leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn16d17s2 configurations  which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior  the highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium 
alloys
plutonium can form alloys and intermediate compounds with most other metals  exceptions include lithium     
and
of the   and   calcium    and barium of the   and
and
of the   partial exceptions include the refractory metals       tantalum  and tungsten  which are soluble in liquid plutonium  but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium  gallium  aluminium  americium 
and cerium can stabilize the  phase of plutonium for room temperature     
and
allow formation of metastable  state when rapidly cooled  high amounts of  
and
also allows some retention of the  phase at room temperature  neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the  phase at higher temperatures 
plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium  if the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive  plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides  the  phase plutoniumgallium and plutoniumaluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium iii  fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium  which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal

plutoniumaluminium is an alternative to the puga alloy  it was the original element considered for  phase stabilization  but its tendency to react with the alpha particles and release neutrons reduces its usability for nuclear weapon pits  plutoniumaluminium alloy can be also used as a component of

plutoniumzirconium alloy can be used as  
plutoniumcerium and plutoniumceriumcobalt alloys are used as nuclear fuels 
plutoniumuranium  with about 1530mol   plutonium  can be used as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors  its
nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components  addition of aluminium  carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly  zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well  addition of titanium and or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy 
plutoniumuraniumtitanium and plutoniumuraniumzirconium were investigated for use as nuclear fuels  the addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance  reduces flammability  and improves ductility  fabricability  strength  and thermal expansion  plutoniumuraniummolybdenum has the best corrosion resistance  forming a protective film of oxides  but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons 
thoriumuraniumplutonium was investigated as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors 
occurrence
trace amounts of plutonium-238 and plutonium-239 can be found in nature  small traces of plutonium-239  a few   and its decay products are naturally found in some concentrated ores of uranium  such as the
in     the ratio of plutonium-239 to uranium at the
uranium deposit ranges from 69882400000000000002.41012 to 6989440000000000000441012  due to its relatively long half-life of about 80million years  it was suggested that
occurs naturally as a   but early reports of its detection could not be confirmed  these trace amounts of 239pu originate in the following fashion  on rare occasions  238u undergoes spontaneous fission  and in the process  the nucleus emits one or two free neutrons with some kinetic energy  when one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another 238u atom  it is absorbed by the atom  which becomes 239u  with a relatively short half-life  239u decays to 239np  which decays into 239pu  finally  exceedingly small amounts of plutonium-238  attributed to the extremely rare
of uranium-238  have been found in natural uranium samples 
minute traces of plutonium are usually found in the human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater
that have been carried out  and to a small number of major   most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the
in 1963  which was signed and ratified by the united states  the united kingdom  the   and other nations  continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by
  test above the
in 1964 
test in 1967  and follow-on tests   and france  tests as recently as the 1990s   because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors  plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far 
history
discovery
and a team of scientists at the
reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934  fermi called the element
and mentioned it in his nobel lecture in 1938  the sample was actually a mixture of barium    and other elements  but this was not known at the time 
was discovered in germany in 1939 by
and   the mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by
and  
and his team at berkeley were the first to produce plutonium 
plutonium  specifically  plutonium-238  was first produced and isolated on december 14  1940  and chemically identified on february 23  1941  by       and
by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the 60-inch  150cm 
at the
at the   in the 1940 experiment  neptunium-238 was created directly by the bombardment but decayed by beta emission with a half-life of a little over two days  which indicated the formation of element 94 
a paper documenting the discovery was prepared by the team and sent to the journal
in march 1941  but publication was delayed until a year after the end of
due to security concerns  at the
in   egon bretscher and
realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product  they calculated that element 94 would be fissile  and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium  and could easily be separated from it 
mcmillan had recently named the first transuranic element neptunium after the planet   and suggested that element 94  being the next element in the series  be named for what was then considered the next planet   
of the cambridge team independently proposed the same name  based on the same reasoning as the berkeley team  seaborg originally considered the name  plutium   but later thought that it did not sound as good as  plutonium   he chose the letters  pu  as a joke  which passed without notice into the periodic table  alternative names considered by seaborg and others were  ultimium  or  extremium  because of the erroneous belief that they had found the last possible
on the  
early research
the dwarf planet   which plutonium is named after
the basic chemistry of plutonium was found to resemble uranium after a few months of initial study  early research was continued at the secret
of the   on august 20  1942  a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time  about 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated  this procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element s atomic weight  on december 2  1942  on a racket court under the west grandstand at the university of chicago s stagg field  researchers headed by
achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as cp-1  using theoretical information garnered from the operation of cp-1  dupont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor  known as x-10  and a pilot chemical separation facility at oak ridge  the separation facility  using methods developed by glenn t  seaborg and a team of researchers at the met lab  removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the x-10 reactor  information from cp-1 was also useful to met lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for hanford  construction at the site began in mid-1943 
in november 1943 some
was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal  a few micrograms of metallic beads  enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye 
the nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also studied  researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart  fissions  by releasing more neutrons and energy  these neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction  this can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a  
during the early stages of research  animals were used to study the effects of radioactive substances on health  these studies began in 1944 at the university of california at berkeleys radiation laboratory and were conducted by joseph g  hamilton  hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode  oral ingestion  inhalation  absorption through skin   retention rates  and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs  hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium-239 compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium  oral  intravenous  etc    eventually  the lab at chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice  rabbits  fish  and even dogs  the results of the studies at berkeley and chicago showed that plutonium s physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium  the most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the  actively metabolizing  portion of bone  furthermore  the rate of plutonium elimination in the excreta differed between species of animals by as much as a factor of five  such variation made it extremely difficult to estimate what the rate would be for human beings 
production during the manhattan project
during world war ii the u s  government established the   which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb  the three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the   the
facilities at   and the weapons research and design laboratory  now known as  
the hanford

the first production reactor that made plutonium-239 was the   it went online in 1943 and was built at a facility in oak ridge that later became the  
in january 1944  workers laid the foundations for the first chemical separation building  t plant located in 200-west  both the t plant and its sister facility in 200-west  the u plant  were completed by october   u plant was used only for training during the manhattan project   the separation building in 200-east  b plant  was completed in february 1945  the second facility planned for 200-east was canceled  nicknamed queen marys by the workers who built them  the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long  65 feet wide  and 80 feet high containing forty process pools  the interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery  even with massive concrete lids on the process pools  precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design 
on april 5  1944 
at los alamos received the first sample of reactor-produced plutonium from oak ridge  within ten days  he discovered that reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of the isotope plutonium-240 than cyclotron-produced plutonium  plutonium-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate  raising the overall background neutron level of the plutonium sample  the original
plutonium weapon  code-named     had to be abandoned as a resultthe increased number of spontaneous neutrons meant that nuclear pre-detonation    was likely 
the entire plutonium weapon design effort at los alamos was soon changed to the more complicated implosion device  code-named     with an implosion weapon  plutonium is compressed to a high density with a technically more daunting task than the simple gun-type design  but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes    by contrast  can be used with either method 
construction of the hanford   the first industrial-sized nuclear reactor for the purposes of material production  was completed in march 1945  b reactor produced the fissile material for the plutonium weapons used during world war ii  b  d and f were the initial reactors built at hanford  and six additional plutonium-producing reactors were built later at the site 
by the end of january 1945  the highly purified plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building  where remaining impurities were removed successfully  los alamos received its first plutonium from hanford on february 2  while it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war s end  hanford was by early 1945 in operation  only two years had passed since col 
first set up his temporary headquarters on the banks of the columbia river 
according to   the plutonium production plants at hanford and
in russia  over a period of four decades   both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment  twice the amount expelled in the

over the years were part of normal operations  but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret  as the pollution continued unabated 
in 2004  a safe was discovered during excavations of a burial trench at the   inside the safe were various items  including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified as the oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist  isotope analysis by
indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the x-10 graphite reactor at oak ridge during 1944 
trinity and fat man atomic bombs
because of the presence of plutonium-240 in reactor-bred plutonium  the implosion design was developed for the    and    weapons
the first atomic bomb test  codenamed
and detonated on july 16  1945  near   used plutonium as its fissile material  the implosion design of     as the trinity device was code-named  used conventional explosive lenses to compress a sphere of plutonium into a supercritical mass  which was simultaneously showered with neutrons from the   an initiator made of
and
      together  these ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion  the overall weapon weighed over 4   although it used just 6.2kg of plutonium in its core  about 20  of the plutonium used in the trinity weapon underwent fission  resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent to approximately 20,000 tons of tnt 
an identical design was used in the  fat man  atomic bomb dropped on     on august 9  1945  killing 35,00040,000 people  most of whom were industrial workers  and destroying 68 80  of war production at nagasaki  only after the announcement of the first atomic bombs was the existence and name of plutonium made known to the public by the manhattan project s

radioactive contamination at the
primarily resulted from two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969  much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992  prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east  into populated areas northwest of denver  the contamination of the denver area by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the 1970s  according to a 1972 study coauthored by    in the more densely populated areas of denver  the pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout   and the plutonium contamination  just east of the rocky flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests   as noted by
in    exposures of a large population in the denver area to plutonium and other radionuclides in the exhaust plumes from the plant date back to 1953   weapons production at the rocky flats plant was halted after a combined

in a presidential memorandum dated january 29  2010  president obama established the   in their final report the commission put forth recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue  including 
 recommendation  1  the united states should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste  
medical experimentation

and
during and after the end of world war ii  scientists working on the manhattan project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects  animal studies found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose 
in the case of human subjects  this involved injecting solutions containing  typically  five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill  or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition  this was reduced to one microgram in july 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than   most of the subjects 
says  were poor  powerless  and sick 
from 1945 to 1947  eighteen human test subjects were injected with plutonium without   the tests were used to create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body in order to develop safety standards for working with plutonium 
was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of plutonium on 10 april 1945 at   this experiment was under the supervision of   other experiments directed by the

chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors  the episode is now considered to be a serious breach of
and of the  
the government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993  when president
ordered a change of policy and federal agencies then made available relevant records  the resulting investigation was undertaken by the presidents   and it uncovered much of the material about plutonium research on humans  the committee issued a controversial 1995 report which said that  wrongs were committed  but it did not condemn those who perpetrated them 
applications
explosives
the
in 1945 had a plutonium core 
the isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons  due to its ease of fission and availability  encasing the bomb s
in a
 an optional layer of dense material  decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach
by
back into the plutonium core  this reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16kg to 10kg  which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters  4in   this critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-235 
the fat man plutonium bombs used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal  combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency  thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an
equivalent to 20 kilotons of tnt  hypothetically  as little as 4kg of plutoniumand maybe even lesscould be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs 
mixed oxide fuel
main article 
from normal
contains plutonium  but it is a mixture of   240  239 and 238  the mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons  but can be used once as   accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed  thermal  neutrons  so that after the second cycle  the plutonium can only be consumed by   if fast neutron reactors are not available  the normal case   excess plutonium is usually discarded  and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste  the desire to consume this plutonium and other
fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors 
the most common chemical process 
 plutoniumuranium extraction 
spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide  mox  fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors  weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix  mox fuel is used in
and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel  after four years  three-quarters of the plutonium is burned  turned into other elements  
are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume 
mox fuel has been in use since the 1980s  and is widely used in europe  in september 2000  the united states and the
signed a
by which each agreed to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium  the
plans to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in the united states before the end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a mox fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors 
mox fuel improves total burnup  a fuel rod is reprocessed after three years of use to remove waste products  which by then account for 3  of the total weight of the rods  any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production  the presence of up to 1  gallium per mass in weapons-grade
has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor 
plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses little proliferation hazard  because of excessive contamination with non-fissile plutonium-240 and plutonium-242  separation of the isotopes is not feasible  a dedicated reactor operating on very low
 hence minimal exposure of newly formed plutonium-239 to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium  is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient   while  weapons-grade  plutonium is defined to contain at least 92  plutonium-239  of the total plutonium   the united states have managed to detonate an
using plutonium believed to contain only about 85  plutonium-239  so called   fuel-grade  plutonium  the  reactor-grade  plutonium produced by a regular lwr burnup cycle typically contains less than 60  pu-239  with up to 30  parasitic pu-240 pu-242  and 1015  fissile pu-241  it is unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated  however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area  the
conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as  direct-use  material  that is   nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment  
power and heat source
a glowing cylinder of 238puo2
the 238puo2 radioisotope thermoelectric generator of the
the isotope plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.74years  it emits a large amount of
with low levels of both  particles and spontaneous neutron rays particles  being an alpha emitter  it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding  a sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238  one
of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat 
these characteristics make it well-suited for electrical power generation for devices that must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime  it is therefore used in
and
such as those in the    
and
space probes  and the
 
the twin voyager spacecraft were launched in 1977  each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source  over 30 years later  each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft  an earlier version of the same technology powered five   starting with
in 1969 
plutonium-238 has also been used successfully to power artificial heart   to reduce the risk of repeated surgery  it has been largely replaced by lithium-based   but as of 2003 there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutonium-powered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients  plutonium-238 was studied as a way to provide supplemental heat to   plutonium-238 mixed with beryllium is used to generate neutrons for research purposes

toxicity
there are two aspects to the harmful effects of plutonium  the radioactivity and the
effects  isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in   contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from   including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned  studies of the effects of these smaller releases  as well as of the widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the   have provided considerable information regarding the dangers  symptoms and prognosis of   which in the case of the japanese  survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure 
during the decay of plutonium  three types of radiation are releasedalpha  beta  and gamma  alpha  beta  and gamma radiation are all forms of   either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of
including       and death  the danger increases with the amount of exposure  alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer  dead layer of human skin  beta radiation can penetrate human skin  but cannot go all the way through the body  gamma radiation can go all the way through the body  even though alpha radiation cannot penetrate the skin  ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs  the   where plutonium accumulates  and the   where it collects and becomes concentrated  are at risk  plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested  only 0.04  of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion  plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly  with a
of 200 years  plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries  so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly 
plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than when ingested  the risk of
increases once the total radiation
of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400   the u s  department of energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles  each about 3 wide  to be 1  over the background u s  average  ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death  however no human being is known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium  and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies 
the    theory in which a particle of plutonium dust irradiates a localized spot of lung tissue is not supported by mainstream researchsuch particles are more mobile than originally thought and toxicity is not measurably increased due to particulate form  when inhaled  plutonium can pass into the bloodstream  once in the bloodstream  plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones  liver  or other body organs  plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer 
a commonly cited quote by
states that a pound of plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would be enough to kill 8 billion people  however  calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation  this makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of   nader s views were challenged in 1976 by   as described in the book nuclear power  both sides  the best arguments for and against the most controversial technology  cohen s own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer 
several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust  e g  people living down-wind of nevada test sites  nagasaki survivors  nuclear facility workers  and  terminally ill  patients injected with pu in 194546 to study pu metabolism  have been carefully followed and analyzed  these studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium-induced cancer results  such as
who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium   there were about 25 workers from los alamos national laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during 1940s  according to the hot-particle theory  each of them has a 99.5  chance of being dead from lung cancer by now  but there has not been a single lung cancer among them  
plutonium has a metallic taste 
criticality potential
a sphere of simulated plutonium surrounded by neutron-reflecting
blocks in a re-enactment of harry daghlian s 1945 experiment
care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass  particularly because plutonium s critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235  a critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and   plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to
by the hydrogen in water 
have occurred in the past  some of them with lethal consequences  careless handling of
bricks around a 6.2kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at los alamos on august 21  1945  when scientist
received a dose estimated to be 5.1sievert  510  and died 25days later  nine months later  another los alamos scientist    died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core  the so-called     that had previously claimed the life of daghlian 
in december 1958  during a process of purifying plutonium at los alamos  a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel  which resulted in the death of a chemical operator named   other
have occurred in the soviet union  japan  the united states  and many other countries 
flammability
metallic plutonium is a fire hazard  especially if the material is finely divided  in a moist environment  plutonium forms hydrides on its surface  which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature  plutonium expands up to 70  in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container  the radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard 
sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire  it cools the burning material  acting as a   and also blocks off oxygen  special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form  generally a dry
atmosphere is required 
transportation
around 11 metric tons of plutonium may be possessed by japan alone  with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in britain and france  this is probably enough to make 6,000 atomic bombs 
land and sea
the usual transportation of plutonium is through the more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package  a typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container  holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide  a sea shipment may consist of several containers  each of them holding a sealed package  the united states
dictates that it must be solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74  20  of radioactive activity  in a recent example  the
and
of pacific nuclear transport ltd  are taking 331kg  730lbs  of plutonium to a united states government facility in    
air
the u s  government air transport regulations permit the transport of plutonium by air  subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight  packaging requirements  and stowage in the rearmost part of the aircraft 
in 2012 media revealed that plutonium has been flown out of norway on commercial around every other yearincluding one time in 2011  regulations permit an airplane to transport 15 grams of fissionable material  such plutonium transportation is without problems  according to a senior advisor  seniorrdgiver  at
