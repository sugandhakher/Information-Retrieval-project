incandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes  light output  and
ratings  from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts  they require no external regulating equipment  have low   and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current  as a result  the incandescent lamp is widely used in household and commercial lighting  for portable lighting such as table lamps  car   and   and for decorative and advertising lighting 
incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting  incandescent bulbs convert less than 5  of the energy they use into visible light  with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2   the remaining energy is converted into heat  the
of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt  compared with 60lm w for a
bulb or 150lm w for some white   some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament  such applications include incubators  brooding boxes for poultry  heat lights for

historian thomas hughes has attributed edison s success to his development of an entire  integrated system of electric lighting 
the lamp was a small component in his system of electric lighting  and no more critical to its effective functioning than the edison jumbo   the edison main and feeder  and the parallel-distribution system  other inventors with generators and incandescent lamps  and with comparable ingenuity and excellence  have long been forgotten because their creators did not preside over their introduction in a system of

timeline of the early evolution of the light bulb
early pre-commercial research
original carbon-filament bulb from  s shop in menlo park
in 1747 an italian monk by the name of giuseppe ponzelli was the first to theorise an incandescent light 
in 1761
demonstrated heating a wire to incandescence 
in 1802 
used what he described as  a
of immense size   consisting of 2,000 cells housed in the basement of the
of great britain  to create an incandescent light by passing the current through a thin strip of   chosen because the metal had an extremely high   it was not bright enough nor did it last long enough to be practical  but it was the precedent behind the efforts of scores of experimenters over the next 75 years 
over the first three-quarters of the 19th century many experimenters worked with various combinations of platinum or iridium wires  carbon rods  and evacuated or semi-evacuated enclosures  many of these devices were demonstrated and some were patented 
in 1835 
demonstrated a constant electric light at a public meeting in dundee  scotland  he stated that he could  read a book at a distance of one and a half feet   however  having perfected the device to his own satisfaction  he turned to the problem of
and did not develop the electric light any further  his claims are not well documented  although he is credited in challoner et al  with being the inventor of the  incandescent light bulb  
in 1838 a belgian by the name of jobard invented an incandescent light bulb with a vacuum atmosphere using a carbon filament 
in 1840  british scientist
enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a
tube and passed an electric current through it  the design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum  improving its longevity  although a workable design  the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use 
in 1841  frederick de moleyns of england was granted the first
for an incandescent lamp  with a design using platinum wires contained within a vacuum bulb  he also used carbon 
in 1845  american
acquired a patent for his incandescent light bulb involving the use of carbon filaments  he died shortly after obtaining the patent  and his invention was never produced commercially  little else is known about him 
in 1851 
publicly demonstrated incandescent light bulbs on his estate in blois  france  his light bulbs are on display in the museum of the  
in 1872  russian
invented an incandescent light bulb and obtained a russian patent in 1874  he used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver  hermetically sealed  and filled with nitrogen  electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed  later he lived in the us  changed his name to alexander de lodyguine and applied and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having          
and
filaments  and a bulb using a molybdenum filament was demonstrated at the
of 1900 in paris 
in 1893 claimed he had designed the first incandescent light bulb in 1854  with a thin carbonized
filament of high resistance  platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope  and a high vacuum  judges of four courts raised doubts about the alleged gbel anticipation  but there was never a decision in a final hearing due to the expiry date of edison s patent  a research work published 2007 concluded that the story of the gbel lamps in the 1850s is a legend 
on 24 july 1874  a canadian patent was filed by
and
for a lamp consisting of carbon rods mounted in a nitrogen-filled glass cylinder  they were unsuccessful at commercializing their lamp  and sold rights to their patent    to thomas edison in 1879

carbon filament lamps  showing darkening of bulb
 18281914  was a british physicist and chemist  in 1850  he began working with carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb  by 1860  he was able to demonstrate a working device but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient source of light  by the mid-1870s better pumps became available  and swan returned to his experiments 
with the help of charles stearn  an expert on vacuum pumps  in 1878  swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening  this received a british patent in 1880      on 18 december 1878  a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the newcastle chemical society  and swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 january 1879  it was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the
on 3 february 1879  these lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament  thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current  so they were not commercially practical  although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum  a carbon conductor  and platinum lead-in wires  this bulb lasted about 40 hours  swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends  he devised a method of treating cotton to produce  parchmentised thread  in the early 1880s and obtained british patent 4933 that same year  from this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in england  his house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power  in 1878 the home of
at
was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity  in the early 1880s he had started his company  in 1881  the
in the   london was lit by swan incandescent lightbulbs  which was the first theatre  and the first public building in the world  to be lit entirely by electricity 
edison carbon filament lamps  early 1880s
began serious research into developing a practical incandescent lamp in 1878  edison filed his first patent application for  improvement in electric lights  on 14 october 1878  after many experiments  first with
in the early 1880s and then with
and other metals  in the end edison returned to a carbon filament  the first successful test was on 22 october 1879  and lasted 13.5 hours  edison continued to improve this design and by 4 november 1879  filed for a us patent for an electric lamp using  a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected     to platina contact wires   although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using  cotton and linen thread  wood splints  papers coiled in various ways   edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours  in 1880  the
steamer    became the first application for edison s incandescent electric lamps  it was also the first ship to execute use of a   
  a new york lawyer  started
in 1878 to exploit his patents and those of   weeks later the united states electric lighting company was organized  this company didn t make their first commercial installation of incandescent lamps until the fall of 1880 at the mercantile safe deposit company in new york city  about six months after the edison incandescent lamps had been installed on the columbia 
was the chief engineer at the united states electric lighting company 
  employed at the time by edison  developed an improved method of heat-treating carbon filaments which reduced breakage and allowed them to be molded into novel shapes  such as the characteristic  m  shape of maxim filaments  on 17 january 1882  latimer received a patent for the  process of manufacturing carbons   an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments  which was purchased by the united states electric light company  latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports 
in britain  the edison and swan companies merged into the
 later known as ediswan  and ultimately incorporated into    edison was initially against this combination  but after swan
him and won  edison was eventually forced to cooperate  and the merger was made  eventually  edison acquired all of swan s interest in the company  swan sold his us patent rights to the

and were invalid  litigation continued for a number of years  eventually on 6 october 1889  a judge ruled that edison s electric light improvement claim for  a filament of carbon of high resistance  was valid 
in 1897  german physicist and chemist

were granted a hungarian patent  no  34541  for a
filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament  tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the
company
in 1904  this type is often called tungsram-bulbs in many european countries  filling a bulb with an

retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum  this allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater

by 1964  improvements in efficiency and production of incandescent lamps had reduced the cost of providing a given quantity of light by a factor of thirty  compared with the cost at introduction of edison s lighting system 
consumption of incandescent light bulbs grew rapidly in the us  in 1885  an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold  all with carbon filaments  when tungsten filaments were introduced  about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the us  in 1914  88.5 million lamps were used   only 15  with carbon filaments   and by 1945  annual sales of lamps were 795 million  more than 5 lamps per person per year

of a light source may be defined in two ways  the radiant luminous efficacy  ler  is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted  the luminous flux  to the total power radiated over all wavelengths  the source luminous efficacy  les  is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted  the luminous flux  to the total power input to the source  such as a lamp  visible light is measured in   a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light  not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye  the luminous efficacy of radiant energy  ler  is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye  the units of luminous efficacy are  lumens per watt   lpw   the maximum ler possible is 683lm w for monochromatic green light at 555 nanometers wavelength  the peak sensitivity of the human eye 
the luminous efficiency is defined as the ratio of the luminous efficacy to the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy of 683 lpw  and  as for luminous efficacy  is of two types  radiant luminous efficiency  lfr  and source luminous efficacy  lfs

the spectrum emitted by a
radiator at temperatures of incandescent bulbs does not match the sensitivity characteristics of the human eye  the light emitted   and most is not in the range of wavelengths at which the eye is most sensitive  tungsten filaments radiate mostly infrared radiation at temperatures where they remain solid  below 3,695k  3,422c  6,191f   donald l  klipstein explains it this way   an ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around 6,300c  6,600k  11,400f   even at this high temperature  a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet  and the theoretical luminous efficacy  ler  is 95 lumens per watt   no known material can be used as a filament at this ideal temperature  which is hotter than the sun s surface  an upper limit for incandescent lamp luminous efficacy  ler  is around 52 lumens per watt  the theoretical value emitted by tungsten at its melting point 
although inefficient  incandescent light bulbs have an advantage in applications where accurate color reproduction is important  since the continuous blackbody spectrum emitted from an incandescent light-bulb filament yields near-perfect color rendition  with a
of 100  the best possible   white-balancing is still required to avoid too  warm  or  cool  colors  but this is a simple process that requires only the color temperature in kelvin as input for modern  digital visual reproduction equipment such as video or still cameras unless it is completely automated  the color-rendering performance of incandescent lights cannot be matched by leds or fluorescent lights  although they can offer satisfactory performance for non-critical applications such as home lighting  white-balancing such lights is therefore more complicated  requiring additional adjustments to reduce for example green-magenta color casts  and even when properly white-balanced  the color reproduction will not be perfect

spectral power distribution of a 25 w incandescent light bulb 
for a given quantity of light  an incandescent light bulb produces more heat  and thus consumes more power  than a   in buildings where
is used  incandescent lamps  heat output increases load on the air conditioning system  while heat from lights will reduce the need for running a building s heating system  in general a heating system can provide the same amount of heat at a lower cost than incandescent lights 
have higher efficacy  which will allow a halogen light to use less power to produce the same amount of light compared to a non-halogen incandescent light  the expected life span of halogen lights is also generally longer compared to non-halogen incandescent lights  and halogen lights produce a more constant light-output over time  without much dimming 
there are many non-incandescent light sources  such as the fluorescent lamp 
and   which have higher luminous efficiency  and some have been designed to be
in fixtures for incandescent lights  these devices produce light by   these lamps produce discrete
and do not have the broad  tail  of invisible infrared emissions  by careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used  and fluorescent coatings which modify the spectral distribution  the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources  or other different
of white light  due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum  the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography 
cost of lighting

the initial cost of an incandescent bulb is small compared to the cost of the energy it uses over its lifetime  incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting  an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive  some types of lamp  including incandescent and fluorescent  emit less light as they age  this may be an inconvenience  or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure  a comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements  cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps  taking into account effective lamp lifetime   cost of electricity used  effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems  when used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings  the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building s
system  during the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted  although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system  regardless  over the course of a year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates 
measures to ban use
main article 
since incandescent light bulbs use more energy than alternatives such as
and   many governments have introduced measures to ban their use  by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps  measures to ban light bulbs have been implemented in the european union  the united states  russia  brazil  argentina  canada and australia  among others  in the europe the ec has calculated that the ban contributes 5 to 10 billion euros to the economy and saves 40 twh of electricity every year  translating in co2 emission reductions of 15 million tonnes 
in the us  federal law has scheduled the most common incandescent light bulbs to be phased out by 2014  to be replaced with more energy-efficient light bulbs  traditional incandescent light bulbs were phased out in australia in november 2009 
objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps  some people have concerns about the
of fluorescent lamps  however  even though they contain   the environmental performance of cfls is much better than that of light bulbs  mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production  led lamps are even more efficient  and are free of mercury  they are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness 
efforts to improve efficiency
some research has been carried out to improve the efficacy of commercial incandescent lamps  in 2007  the consumer lighting division of
announced a  high efficiency incandescent   hei  lamp project  which they claimed would ultimately be as much as four times more efficient than current incandescents  although their initial production goal was to be approximately twice as efficient  the hei program was terminated in 2008 due to slow progress 
us department of energy research at
initially indicated the potential for dramatically improved efficiency from a photonic lattice filament  however  later work indicated that initially promising results were in error 
prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency  new  hybrid  incandescent bulbs have been introduced by   the  halogena energy saver  incandescents can produce about 23 lm w  about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents  by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light  this concept was pioneered by duro-test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm w  more advanced reflectors based on
or
can theoretically result in higher efficiency  up to a limit of about 270 lm w  40  of the maximum efficacy possible   laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lm w  approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs 
construction
incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure  the envelope  or bulb  with a filament of
wire inside the bulb  through which an
is passed  contact wires and a base with two  or more  conductors provide electrical connections to the filament  incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb s base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks  small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires 
an electric current heats the filament to typically 2,000 to 3,300k  3,140 to 5,480f   well below tungsten s melting point of 3,695k  6,191f   filament temperatures depend on the filament type  shape  size  and amount of current drawn  the heated filament emits light that approximates a   the useful part of the emitted energy is   but most energy is given off as heat in the near- wavelengths 
have two filaments and three conducting contacts in their bases  the filaments share a common ground  and can be lit separately or together  common wattages include 3070100  50100150  and 100200300  with the first two numbers referring to the individual filaments  and the third giving the combined wattage 
most light bulbs have either clear or coated glass  the coated glass bulbs have a white powdery substance on the inside called   kaolin  or   is a white  chalky clay in a very fine powder form  that is blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb  it diffuses the light emitted from the filament  producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light  manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb  kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light  other kinds of colored bulbs are also made  including the various colors used for  party bulbs  
lights and other decorative lighting  these are created by

 one or more contacts on the base  shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support   some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end  miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts  and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires  contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament  power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts 
the glass bulb of a general service lamp can reach temperatures between 200 and 260c  392 and 500f   lamps intended for high power operation or used for heating purposes will have envelopes made of hard glass or

gas fill
the bulb is filled with an   to reduce
of the filament and prevent its
at a pressure of about 70kpa  0.7atm  
the role of the gas is to prevent evaporation of the filament  without introducing significant heat losses  for these properties  chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable  the presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament  reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life  or  for operating at the same temperature  prolongs the filament life   it however introduces heat losses  and therefore efficiency loss  from the filament  by
and  
early lamps  and some small modern lamps used only a vacuum to protect the filament from oxygen  this however increases evaporation of the filament  albeit it eliminates the heat losses 
the most common fills are 
  used in small lamps  provides best thermal insulation of the filament but does not protect against its evaporation  used also in larger lamps where the outer bulb surface temperature has to be limited 
 93   and
 7    where argon is used for its inertness  low thermal conductivity and low cost  and the nitrogen is added to increase the breakdown voltage and prevent arcing between parts of the filament
nitrogen  used in some higher-power lamps  e g  projection lamps  and where higher breakdown voltage is needed due to proximity of filament parts or lead-in wires
  which is more advantageous than argon due to its higher atomic weight and lower thermal conductivity  which also allows use of smaller bulbs   but its use is hindered by much higher cost  confining it mostly to smaller-size bulbs 
krypton mixed with   where xenon improves the gas properties further due to its higher atomic weight  its use is however limited by its very high cost  the improvements by using xenon are modest in comparison to its cost 
  in special flashing lamps where rapid filament cooling is required  its high thermal conductivity is exploited here 
the gas fill must be free of traces of water  in the presence of the hot filament  water reacts with tungsten forming tungsten trioxide and atomic hydrogen  the oxide deposits on the bulb inner surface and reacts with hydrogen  decomposing to metallic tungsten and water  water then cycles back to the filament  this greatly accelerates the bulb blackening  in comparison with evaporation-only 
the gas layer close to the filament  called the langmuir layer  is stagnant  heat transfer occurs only by conduction  only at some distance does convection occur to carry heat to the bulb envelope 
the orientation of the filament influences efficiency  gas flow parallel to the filament  e g  a vertically oriented bulb with vertical  or axial  filament  reduces convective losses 
the efficiency of the lamp increases with a larger filament diameter  thin-filament  low-power bulbs benefit less from a fill gas  so are often only evacuated  in special cases  when rapid cooling of a filament is needed  e g  in flashing lights   hydrogen gas fill is used 
early lightbulbs with carbon filaments also used carbon monoxide  nitrogen  or mercury vapor  carbon filaments however operate at lower temperatures than tungsten ones  so the effect of the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits 
manufacturing
tantalum filament light bulb  1908  the first metal filament bulb
early lamps were laboriously assembled by hand  after automatic machinery was developed the cost of lamps fell 
in manufacturing the glass bulb  a type of  ribbon machine  is used  a continuous ribbon of glass is passed along a conveyor belt  heated in a furnace  and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds  thus the glass bulbs are created  after the bulbs are blown  and cooled  they are cut off the ribbon machine  a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour  the filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem  which is fused to the bulb  the air is pumped out of the bulb  and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame  the bulb is then inserted into the lamp base  and the whole assembly tested 
filament
the first successful light bulb filaments were made of
 from carbonized paper or    early carbon filaments had a negative
 as they got hotter  their electrical resistance decreased  this made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply  since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up  reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further  in the  flashing  process  carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor  usually gasoline   the carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency  a metallized or  graphitized  filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly  this transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament  this also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient  like a metallic conductor  and helped stabilize the lamp s power consumption  temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage 
in 1902  the
company developed a
lamp filament  these lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures  since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon  the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports  the metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use  the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use  this made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile  metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding  though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament  general electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the us until 1913 
from 1898 to around 1905 
was also used as a lamp filament in europe  and the metal was so expensive that used broken lamps could be returned for partial credit  it could not be made for 110 v or 220 v so several lamps were wired in series for use on standard voltage circuits 
how a tungsten filament is made
in 1906  the
filament was introduced  tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires  filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile  by 1910  a process was developed by

for production of a ductile form of tungsten  the process required pressing tungsten powder into bars  then several steps of sintering  swaging  and then wire drawing  it was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use  and that a very small  doping  treatment with potassium  silicon  and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments 
coiled coil filament
to improve the efficiency of the lamp  the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire  also known as a  coiled coil   for a 60-watt 120-volt lamp  the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually 22.8 inches  580mm   and the filament diameter is 0.0018 inches  0.046mm   the advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil  the coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power  as a result  the filament can then run hotter  which results in a more efficient light source  while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature 
there are several different shapes of filament used in lamps  with differing characteristics  manufacturers designate the types with codes such as c-6  cc-6  c-2v  cc-2v  c-8  cc-88  c-2f  cc-2f  c-bar  c-bar-6  c-8i  c-2r  cc-2r  and axial

reducing filament evaporation
one of the problems of the standard electric light bulb is filament notching due to evaporation of the filament  small variations in
along the filament cause  hot spots  to form at points of higher resistivity  a variation of diameter of only 1  will cause a 25  reduction in service life  these hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament  which increases the resistance at that pointthis creates a
that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament 
found that an inert gas  instead of vacuum  would retard evaporation  general service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly
and some   or sometimes   lamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to ac operation  different alloys of tungsten and
can be used to counteract the effect 
since a filament breaking in a gas-filled bulb can form an   which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current  intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate protection devices are therefore often used as
built into the light bulb  more nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing 
while inert gas reduces filament evaporation  it also conducts heat from the filament  thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency  at constant pressure and temperature  the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules  higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity  because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher 
gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight  but is also more expensive  so its use is limited to smaller lamps 
during ordinary operation  the tungsten of the filament evaporates  hotter  more-efficient filaments evaporate faster  because of this  the lifetime of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity  the trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination  theatrical  photographic  and projection lamps may have a useful life of only a few hours  trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form  long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used 
if a light bulb envelope leaks  the hot tungsten filament reacts with air  yielding an aerosol of brown   brown   violet-blue   and yellow
that then deposits on the nearby surfaces or the bulb interior 
bulb blackening
in a conventional lamp  the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses on the inner surface of the glass envelope  darkening it  for bulbs that contain a vacuum  the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope  when a filling of inert gas is used  the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas  depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope  an incandescent lamp that gives 93  or less of its initial light output at 75  of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory  when tested according to iec publication 60064  light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening  study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the
and invention of the  
a very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening  water vapor
into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament  the oxygen attacks the tungsten metal  and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp  hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide  reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle  the equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening  small amounts of substances such as
are placed within the lamp as a
to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation 
some old  high-powered lamps used in theater  projection  searchlight  and lighthouse service with heavy  sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope  from time to time  the operator would remove the bulb and shake it  allowing the tungsten powder to scrub off most of the tungsten that had condensed on the interior of the envelope  removing the blackening and brightening the lamp again

the
reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a
gas at low pressure  rather than an inert gas  the
increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament  the halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life  such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs  and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space

incandescent arc lamps
a variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament  but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat  the electrode then became incandescent  with the arc contributing little to the light produced  such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as   these arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope  they provided the intense concentrated light of an

power
incandescent lamps are nearly pure resistive loads with a
of 1  this means the actual power consumed  in watts  and the apparent power  in   are equal  incandescent light bulbs are usually
according to the
consumed  this is measured in watts and depends mainly on the
of the filament  which in turn depends mainly on the filament s length  thickness  and material  for two bulbs of the same voltage  type  color  and clarity  the higher-powered bulb gives more light 
the table shows the approximate typical output  in   of standard incandescent light bulbs at various powers  light output of a 230 v version is usually slightly less than that of a 120 v version  the lower current  higher voltage  filament is thinner and has to be operated at a slightly lower temperature for same life expectancy  and that reduces energy efficiency  the lumen values for  soft white  bulbs will generally be slightly lower than for clear bulbs at the same power 
current and resistance
the actual resistance of the filament is temperature dependent  the cold resistance of tungsten-filament lamps is about 1/15 the hot-filament resistance when the lamp is operating  for example  a 100-watt  120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144
when lit  but the cold resistance is much lower  about 9.5 ohms   since incandescent lamps are resistive loads  simple phase-control
can be used to control brightness  electrical contacts may carry a  t  rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps  for a 100-watt  120-volt general-service lamp  the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds  and the lamp reaches 90  of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds 
carbon filament bulbs have the opposite characteristic  the resistance of a carbon filament is higher when it is cold than when it is operating  in the case of a 240volt  60watt carbon filament bulb  the resistance of the filament when at operating temperature is 960ohms  but rises to around 1500ohms when cold   
physical characteristics
bulb shapes
incandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes 
incandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes  the names of the shapes vary somewhat from region to regions  many of these shapes have a designation consisting of one or more letters followed by one or more numbers  e g  a55 or par38  the letters represent the shape of the bulb  the numbers represent the maximum diameter  either in 18 of an inch  or in millimeters  depending on the shape and the region  for example  63mm reflectors are designated r63  but in the us  they are known as r20  2.5in   however  in both regions  a par38 reflector is known as par38

40-watt light bulbs with standard e10  e14 and e27 edison screw base
the double-contact bayonet cap on an incandescent bulb
very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp  and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections  some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires  most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires  in the late 19th century  manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases 
introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the
trademark in 1909  this standard was soon adopted across the us  and the mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945  today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an
in candelabra  intermediate  or standard or mogul sizes  or double contact
base  technical standards for lamp bases include ansi standard c81.67 and iec standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes  to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer s products  bayonet base lamps are frequently used in
to resist loosening due to vibration  a
base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps 
lamp bases may be secured to the bulb with a cement  or by mechanical crimping to indentations molded into the glass bulb 
miniature lamps used for some automotive lamps or decorative lamps have
that have a partial plastic or even completely glass base  in this case  the wires wrap around to the outside of the bulb  where they press against the contacts in the socket  miniature christmas bulbs use a plastic wedge base as well 
lamps intended for use in optical systems such as film projectors  microscope illuminators  or
have bases with alignment features so that the filament is positioned accurately within the optical system  a screw-base lamp may have a random orientation of the filament when the lamp is installed in the socket 
light output and lifetime
the

various lighting spectra as viewed in a diffraction grating  upper left  fluorescent lamp  upper right  incandescent bulb  lower left  white led  lower right  candle flame

incandescent lamps are very sensitive to changes in the supply voltage  these characteristics are of great practical and economic importance 
for a supply voltage v near the rated voltage of the lamp 
light output is approximately proportional to v 3.4
power consumption is approximately proportional to v 1.6
lifetime is approximately proportional to v 16
color temperature is approximately proportional to v 0.42
this means that a 5  reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb  at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16   this may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location  for example  traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings   long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off  since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp  general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life  the objective is to minimize the cost of light  not the cost of lamps  early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours  but in 1924 a
agreed to limit life to 1000 hours  when this was exposed in 1953  general electric and other leading american manufacturers were banned from limiting the life 
the relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around rated conditions  but they do indicate that a lamp operated at much lower than rated voltage could last for hundreds of times longer than at rated conditions  albeit with greatly reduced light output  the    is a light bulb that is accepted by the
as having been burning almost continuously at a
in   since 1901  however  the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb  a similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in texas that has been illuminated since 21 september 1908  it once resided in an
where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow  and was moved to an area museum in 1977 
in flood lamps used for photographic lighting  the tradeoff is made in the other direction  compared to general-service bulbs  for the same power  these bulbs produce far more light  and  more importantly  light at a higher color temperature  at the expense of greatly reduced life  which may be as short as two hours for a type p1 lamp   the upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal  tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point  3,695k  6,191f   a 50-hour-life projection bulb  for instance  is designed to operate only 50c  122f  below that melting point  such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt  compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp 
lamps designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy  for example  a 100-watt  120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt  a lamp with the same rated lifetime but designed for 230 v would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt  and a similar lamp designed for 30 volts  train lighting  would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt  lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament  for the same power rating  they can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates 
the wires used to support the filament make it mechanically stronger  but remove heat  creating another tradeoff between efficiency and long life  many general-service 120-volt lamps use no additional support wires  but lamps designed for    or  vibration service  may have as many as five  low-voltage lamps have filaments made of heavier wire and do not require additional support wires 
very low voltages are inefficient since the lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament  so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts  very long filaments for high voltages are fragile  and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate  so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts  some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages  but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals
