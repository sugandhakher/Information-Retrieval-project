part of a series about
green vehicle
a green vehicle or environmentally-friendly vehicle is a road
that produces less harmful impacts to the
than comparable conventional
vehicles running on
or   or one that uses certain   presently  in some countries the term is used for any vehicle complying or surpassing the more stringent
 such as euro6   or  s
standards  such as          or the
enacted in several countries 
green vehicles can be powered by
and advanced vehicle technologies and include        
and        
vehicles  and some sources also include vehicles using blends of
and
or   several author also include conventional motor vehicles with high   as they consider that increasing fuel economy is the most
way to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector in the short run  as part of their contribution to   these vehicles reduce
and   and contribute to
by reducing oil imports 
an environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions  a
involves production and post-use considerations  a
is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency 
contents
energy efficiency  
cars with similar production of energy costs can obtain  during the life of the car  operational phase   large reductions in energy costs through several measures 
the most significant is by using  
an efficient engine that reduces the vehicle s consumption of
 i e     or that uses
sources throughout its working life 
using
instead of petroleum fuels 
proper maintenance of a vehicle such as engine     and maintaining proper
can also help 
removing unnecessary items from a vehicle reduces weight and improves fuel economy as well

further information 
green vehicles include vehicles types that function fully or partly on alternative energy sources other than
or less carbon intensive than gasoline or diesel 
another option is the use of
composition in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles  making them function partially on renewable energy sources  other approaches include   a
concept that offers automated  on-demand  non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways 
electric and fuel cell-powered

are typically more efficient than -powered vehicles on a
basis  for this reason   
and plug-in hybrids are gaining popularity  they have better
than conventional
vehicles but are hampered by
or maximum distance attainable before discharging the battery  the
are their main cost  they provide a 0  to 99.9  reduction in
emissions compared to an
 gasoline  diesel  vehicle  depending on the source of electricity 
hybrid electric vehicles

may be partly fossil fuel  or biofuel  powered and partly electric or hydrogen-powered  most combine an internal combustion engine with an electric engine  though other variations too exist  the internal combustion engine is often either a gasoline or diesel engine  in rare cases a stirling engine may even be used   they are more expensive to purchase but cost redemption is achieved in a period of about 5 years due to better fuel economy

a conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle by mixing in
or using less carbon intensive   typical -powered cars can tolerate up to 10    brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol  though there were discontinued  another available option is a

-powered vehicles can often transition completely to   though the fuel is a very strong   which can occasionally damage
seals in vehicles built before 1994  more commonly  however  biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine  clogging   unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel  it is very effective at  de-coking  the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean  biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines  diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines  biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some north american national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days  biodiesel and   diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the us tour de sol competition 
this presents problems  as biofuels can use food resources in order to provide mechanical energy for vehicles  many experts point to this as a reason for growing food prices  particularly us bio-ethanol fuel production which has affected maize prices  in order to have a low environmental impact  biofuels should be made only from waste products  or from new sources like  
electric motor and pedal powered vehicles  
multiple companies are offering and developing two  three  and four wheel vehicles combining the characteristics of a bicycle with electric motors  us federal  state and local laws do not clearly nor consistently classify
these vehicles as

further information 
 
vehicles are not usually included in the green vehicle category  but
 prt  vehicles probably should be  all vehicles that are powered from the track have the advantage of potentially being able to use any source of electric energy  including sustainable ones  rather than requiring liquid fuels  they can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles  also  they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors  not just the vehicle surface  the potential
is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain 
are
powered by

 pv  cells convert the sun s energy directly into   solar vehicles are not practical day-to-day transportation devices at present  but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises  often sponsored by government agencies  however  some cities have begun offering   including the
in  
primarily use wind-turbines installed at a strategic point of the vehicle  which are then converted into electric energy which causes the vehicle to propel 
animal powered vehicles  
are just one type of animal propelled vehicle  once a common form of transportation  they became far less common as cities grew and automobiles took their place  in dense cities  the waste produced by large numbers of transportation animals was a significant health problem  oftentimes the food is produced for them using diesel powered tractors  and thus there is some environmental impact as a result of their use 
human powered vehicles  
in    
see also 
human powered transport includes walking        and other environmentally friendly ways of getting around  in addition to the health benefits of the exercise provided  they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options  the only downside is the speed limitations  and how far one can travel before getting exhausted 
benefits of green vehicle use  
environmental  
vehicle emissions contribute to the increasing concentration of gases linked to   in order of significance  the principal
associated with road transport are carbon dioxide  co2   methane  ch4  and nitrous oxide  n2o   road transport is the third largest source of greenhouse gases emitted in the uk  and accounts for over 20  of total emissions  and 33  in the united states  of the total greenhouse gas emissions from transport  over 85  are due to co2 emissions from road vehicles  the transport sector is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases 
health  
vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer  a 1998 report estimated that up to 24,000 people die prematurely each year in the uk as a direct result of air pollution  according to the   up to 13,000 deaths per year among children  aged 04 years  across europe are directly attributable to outdoor pollution  the organization estimates that if pollution levels were returned to within eu limits  more than 5,000 of these lives could be saved each year 
monetary  
in
have also reported that reduced fuel consumption saves them thousands of dollars per year 
criticism  
a study by cnw marketing research suggested that the extra energy cost of manufacture  shipping  disposal  and the short lives of some of these types of vehicle  particularly gas-electric   outweighs any energy savings made by their using less petroleum during their useful lifespan  this type of argument is the
argument  critics of the report note that the study prorated all of toyota s hybrid research-and-development costs across the relatively small number of priuses on the road  rather than using the incremental cost of building a vehicle  used109,000 miles  175,000km  for the length of life of a prius  toyota offers a 150,000-mile  240,000km  warranty on the prius  hybrid components  including the battery   and calculated that a majority of a car s cradle-to-grave energy gets expended during the vehicle s production  not while it is driven 
official bente verli stated that  cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others   based on this opinion  norwegian law severely restricts the use of    to market automobiles  strongly prohibiting advertising a vehicle as being environmentally friendly  with large fines issued to violators 
a study that looked at other factors other than energy consumption and carbon emissions has suggested that there is no such thing as an environmentally friendly car 
the use of vehicles with increased fuel efficiency is usually considered positive in the short term but criticism of any hydrocarbon-based personal transport remains  the
suggests that energy efficiency programs are often counter-productive  even increasing energy consumption in the long run  many environmental researchers believe that
may require a move away from hydrocarbon fuels and from our present automobile and highway paradigm 
national and international promotion  
european union  
the
is promoting the marketing of greener cars via a combination of binding and non-binding measures  as of april 2010  15 of the 27
provide tax incentives for
and some   which includes all
countries except
and   plus the
and   the incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions  as well as of bonus payments for buyers of    
and  
united states  
the
 epa  is promoting the marketing of greener cars via the
program  the smartway and smartway elite designation mean that a vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles  this us epa designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle s air pollution score and greenhouse gas score  higher air pollution scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles  higher greenhouse gas scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide and have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles 
to earn the smartway designation  a vehicle must earn at least a 6 on the air pollution score and at least a 6 on the greenhouse gas score  but have a combined score of at least 13  smartway elite is given to those vehicles that score 9 or better on both the greenhouse gas and air pollution scores 
a green vehicle marketing alliance  in conjunction with the
 onrl   periodically meets  and coordinates marketing efforts 
progressive insurance automotive x prize  
the progressive insurance automotive x prize  piaxp  is a set of competitions  programs and events  from the
to  inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break america s addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change  
is the title sponsor of the prize  the centerpiece of which is the competition division  within which a  10 million purse will be divided between the winners of three competitions 
the essence of each competition is to design  build and race super-efficient vehicles that will achieve 100
 2.35 liter 100 kilometer  and can be produced for the mass market  within the competition division  there are two vehicle classes  mainstream and alternative  the mainstream class has a prize of  5 million  the alternate class has 2 separate prizes of  2.5 million  one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating 
some of the competitors  such as aptera and tesla  are already taking deposits for  green  vehicles from customers
