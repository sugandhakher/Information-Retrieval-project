a tanker  or tank ship or tankship  is a

background  
tankers can range in size of capacity from several hundred   which includes vessels for servicing small harbours and coastal settlements  to several hundred thousand tons  for long-range haulage  besides ocean- or seagoing tankers there are also specialized inland-waterway tankers which operate on rivers and canals with an average
capacity up to some thousand tons  a wide range of products are carried by tankers  including 
products such as  
 lpg   and
 lng 
  such as     and

tankers are a relatively new concept  dating from the later years of the 19th century  before this  technology had simply not supported the idea of carrying bulk liquids  the market was also not geared towards transporting or selling cargo in bulk  therefore most ships carried a wide range of different products in different holds and traded outside fixed routes  liquids were usually loaded in caskshence the term     which refers to the volume of the holds in terms of how many
or casks of wine could be carried  even potable water  vital for the survival of the crew  was stowed in casks  carrying bulk liquids in earlier ships posed several problems 
the holds  on timber ships the holds were not sufficiently water  oil or air-tight to prevent a liquid cargo from spoiling or leaking  the development of iron and steel hulls solved this problem 
loading and discharging  bulk liquids must be pumped - the development of efficient pumps and piping systems was vital to the development of the tanker  steam engines were developed as prime-movers for early pumping systems  dedicated cargo handling facilities were now required ashore too - as was a market for receiving a product in that quantity  casks could be unloaded using ordinary cranes  and the awkward nature of the casks meant that the volume of liquid was always relatively small - therefore keeping the market more stable 
  a large body of liquid carried aboard a ship will impact on the ship s stability  particularly when the liquid is flowing around the hold or tank in response to the ship s movements  the effect was negligible in casks  but could cause capsizing if the tank extended the width of the ship  a problem solved by extensive subdivision of the tanks 
tankers were first used by the
to transfer refined fuel in bulk from refineries to customers  this would then be stored in large tanks ashore  and subdivided for delivery to individual locations  the use of tankers caught on because other liquids were also cheaper to transport in bulk  store in dedicated terminals  then subdivide  even the

different products require different handling and transport  with specialised variants such as         and    developed to handle dangerous chemicals  oil and oil-derived products  and
respectively  these broad variants may be further differentiated with respect to ability to carry only a single product or simultaneously transport mixed cargoes such as several different chemicals or refined petroleum products  among oil tankers

despite being highly regulated  tankers have been involved in environmental disasters resulting from   see

for examples of coastal accidents 
design considerations  
many modern tankers are designed for a specific cargo and a specific route 
is typically limited by the depth of water in loading and unloading harbors  and may be limited by the depth of
along the preferred shipping route  cargoes with high
at ambient temperatures may require pressurized tanks or vapor recovery systems  tank heaters may be required to maintain         or molasses in a fluid state for offloading 
tanker capacity  
tankers used for liquid fuels are classified according to their capacity

very large crude carrier size range there are more ships smaller in size 
at nearly 380 vessels in the size range 279,000t to 320,000t  these are by far the most popular size range among the larger vlccs  only seven vessels are larger than this  and approximately 90 between 220,000t and 279,000t 
fleets of the world  
flag states
as of 2005  the united states maritime administration s statistics count 4,024 tankers of 10,000lt or greater worldwide  2,582 of these are double-hulled 
is the leading
of tankers with 592 registered ships  five other flag states have more than two hundred registered tankers 
 520  
 323  
 233  
 274  and
 215   these flag states are also the top six in terms of fleet size in terms of  
largest fleets
greece  japan  and the united states are the top three owners of tankers  including those owned but    with 733  394  and 311 vessels respectively  these three nations account for 1,438 vessels or over 36  of the world s fleet 
builders
asian companies dominate the construction of tankers  of the world s 4,024 tankers  2,822 or over 70  were built in south korea  japan or china
