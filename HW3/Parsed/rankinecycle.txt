the rankine cycle is a model that is used to predict the performance of steam turbine systems  the rankine cycle is an idealized
of a
that converts heat into mechanical work  the heat is supplied externally to a closed loop  which usually uses water as the   it is named after   a scottish

description  
physical layout of the four main devices used in the rankine cycle
the rankine cycle closely describes the process by which steam-operated
commonly found in thermal
generate power  the heat sources used in these power plants are usually
or the combustion of fossil fuels such as     and  
the efficiency of the rankine cycle is limited by the high heat of vaporization of the working fluid  also  unless the pressure and temperature reach
levels in the steam boiler  the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small  steam turbine entry temperatures are typically around 565c and steam condenser temperatures are around 30c  this gives a theoretical maximum
for the steam turbine alone of about 63  compared with an actual overall thermal efficiency of up to 42  for a modern coal-fired power station  this low steam turbine entry temperature  compared to a   is why the rankine  steam  cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle to recover otherwise rejected heat in
power stations 
the working fluid in a rankine cycle follows a closed loop and is reused constantly  the water
with condensed droplets often seen billowing from power stations is created by the cooling systems  not directly from the closed-loop rankine power cycle  and represents the means for  low temperature  waste heat to exit the system  allowing for the addition of  higher temperature  heat that can then be converted to useful work  power   this  exhaust  heat is represented by the  qout  flowing out of the lower side of the cycle shown in the t s diagram below 
operate as large heat exchangers by absorbing the latent
of the working fluid and simultaneously evaporating cooling water to the atmosphere  while many substances could be used as the working fluid in the rankine cycle  water is usually the fluid of choice due to its favorable properties  such as its non-toxic and unreactive chemistry  abundance  and low cost  as well as its   by condensing the working steam vapor to a liquid the pressure at the turbine outlet is lowered and the energy required by the feed pump consumes only 1  to 3  of the turbine output power and these factors contribute to a higher efficiency for the cycle  the benefit of this is offset by the low temperatures of steam admitted to the turbine s     for instance  have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500c  however  the thermal efficiency of actual large steam power stations and large modern gas turbine stations are similar 
the four processes in the rankine cycle  
of a typical rankine cycle operating between pressures of 0.06bar and 50bar
there are four processes in the rankine cycle  these states are identified by numbers  in brown  in the above t-s diagram 
process 1-2  the working fluid is pumped from low to high pressure  as the fluid is a liquid at this stage  the pump requires little input energy 
process 2-3  the high pressure liquid enters a boiler where it is heated at constant pressure by an external heat source to become a dry saturated vapour  the input energy required can be easily calculated graphically  using an
 aka
or    or numerically  using  
process 3-4  the dry saturated vapour expands through a   generating power  this decreases the temperature and pressure of the vapour  and some condensation may occur  the output in this process can be easily calculated using the chart or tables noted above 
process 4-1  the wet vapour then enters a
where it is condensed at a constant pressure to become a  
in an ideal rankine cycle the pump and turbine would be   i e   the pump and turbine would generate no entropy and hence maximize the net work output  processes 1-2 and 3-4 would be represented by vertical lines on the
and more closely resemble that of the carnot cycle  the rankine cycle shown here prevents the vapor ending up in the superheat region after the expansion in the turbine 
which reduces the energy removed by the condensers 
the actual vapor power cycle differs from the ideal rankine cycle because of irreversibilities in the inherent components caused by fluid friction and heat loss to the surroundings  fluid friction causes pressure drops in the boiler  the condenser  and the piping between the components  and as a result the steam leaves the boiler at a lower pressure  heat loss reduces the net work output  thus heat addition to the steam in the boiler is required to maintain the same level of net work output

real rankine cycle  non-ideal   
rankine cycle with superheat
in a real power plant cycle  the name  rankine  cycle is used only for the ideal cycle   the compression by the
and the expansion in the
are not isentropic  in other words  these processes are non-reversible and
is increased during the two processes  this somewhat increases the
required by the pump and decreases the power generated by the turbine 
in particular the efficiency of the steam turbine will be limited by water droplet formation  as the water condenses  water droplets hit the turbine blades at high speed causing pitting and erosion  gradually decreasing the life of turbine blades and efficiency of the turbine  the easiest way to overcome this problem is by superheating the steam  on the
above  state 3 is above a two phase region of steam and water so after expansion the steam will be very wet  by superheating  state 3 will move to the right of the diagram and hence produce a drier steam after expansion

of that cycle  increasing the temperature of the steam into the superheat region is a simple way of doing this  there are also variations of the basic rankine cycle which are designed to raise the thermal efficiency of the cycle in this way  two of these are described below 
rankine cycle with reheat  
rankine cycle with reheat
the purpose of a reheating cycle is to remove the moisture carried by the steam at the final stages of the expansion process  in this variation  two
work in series  the first accepts
from the
at high pressure  after the vapor has passed through the first turbine  it re-enters the boiler and is reheated before passing through a second  lower-pressure  turbine  the reheat temperatures are very close or equal to the inlet temperatures  whereas the optimum reheat pressure needed is only one fourth of the original boiler pressure  among other advantages  this prevents the vapor from
during its expansion and thereby damaging the turbine blades  and improves the efficiency of the cycle  because more of the heat flow into the cycle occurs at higher temperature  the reheat cycle was first introduced in the 1920s  but was not operational for long due to technical difficulties  in the 1940s  it was reintroduced with the increasing manufacture of high-pressure   and eventually double reheating was introduced in the 1950s  the idea behind double reheating is to increase the average temperature  it was observed that more than two stages of reheating are unnecessary  since the next stage increases the cycle efficiency only half as much as the preceding stage  today  double reheating is commonly used in power plants that operate under supercritical pressure 
regenerative rankine cycle  
regenerative rankine cycle
the regenerative rankine cycle is so named because after emerging from the condenser  possibly as a   the working fluid is heated by
tapped from the hot portion of the cycle  on the diagram shown  the fluid at 2 is mixed with the fluid at 4  both at the same pressure  to end up with the saturated liquid at 7  this is called  direct contact heating   the regenerative rankine cycle  with minor variants  is commonly used in real power stations 
another variation sends bleed steam from between turbine stages to
to preheat the water on its way from the condenser to the boiler  these heaters do not mix the input steam and condensate  function as an ordinary tubular heat exchanger  and are named  closed feedwater heaters  
regeneration increases the cycle heat input temperature by eliminating the addition of heat from the boiler fuel source at the relatively low feedwater temperatures that would exist without regenerative feedwater heating  this improves the efficiency of the cycle  as more of the heat flow into the cycle occurs at higher temperature 
organic rankine cycle  
main article 
the organic rankine cycle  orc  uses an organic fluid such as
or
in place of water and steam  this allows use of lower-temperature heat sources  such as   which typically operate at around 7090 c  the
of the cycle is much lower as a result of the lower temperature range  but this can be worthwhile because of the lower cost involved in gathering heat at this lower temperature  alternatively  fluids can be used that have boiling points above water  and this may have thermodynamic benefits  see  for example   
the rankine cycle does not restrict the working fluid in its definition  so the name organic cycle is simply a marketing concept and the cycle should not be regarded as a separate thermodynamic cycle 
supercritical rankine cycle  
the rankine cycle applied using a
combines the concepts of heat regeneration and supercritical rankine cycle into a unified process called the regenerative supercritical cycle  rgsc  cycle  it is optimised for temperature sources 125 - 450c
