history  
  president of
from 1972 to 1988  founded jstor  jstor originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries  especially   due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence  most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals  by digitizing many journal titles  jstor allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term  online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically 
bowen initially considered using cd-roms for distribution  however    princeton university s vice-president for computing and information technology  convinced bowen that cd-rom was an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility   for example  all princeton s administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989  the student dormitory network was completed in 1994  and campus networks like the one at princeton were  in turn  linked to larger networks such as
and the    jstor was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites  and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals  jstor access improved based on feedback from its initial sites  and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary   special software was put in place   to make pictures and graphs clear and readable 
with the success of this limited project  bowen and kevin guthrie  then-president of jstor  wanted to expand the number of participating journals  they met with representatives of the
and an agreement was made   to digitize the
dating from its beginning in 1665  the work of adding these volumes to jstor was completed by december 2000 
the
funded jstor initially  until january 2009 jstor operated as an independent  self-sustaining
with offices in
and in     then jstor merged with the nonprofit
- a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and  dedicated to helping the
take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies

in addition to the main site  the jstor labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of corpus analysis at its data for research service  this site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main jstor site  users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and

in late 2010 and early 2011  internet activist
used  s data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of jstor s collection of academic journal articles  when the bulk-download was discovered  jstor employees initially placed a video camera in the room to film the mysterious visitor and left the relevant computer untouched  once video was captured of the visitor  the download was stopped and swartz identified  rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him  in june 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data  the articles that were downloaded by swartz were from scholarly journals which published scientific papers largely funded by public universities and taxpayer money 
the following month  federal authorities charged swartz with several   -related crimes  including   computer fraud  unlawfully obtaining information from a   and recklessly damaging a protected computer  prosecutors in the case claimed that swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on  
swartz surrendered to authorities  pleaded not guilty to all counts  and was released on  100,000 bail  in september 2012  u s  attorneys increased the number of charges against swartz from four to thirteen  with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and  1 million in fines  the case still was pending when swartz committed
in january 2013  prosecutors dropped the charges after his death 
limitations  
the availability of most journals on jstor is controlled by a     which is an agreed-upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on jstor  this time period is specified by agreement between jstor and the publisher of the journal  which usually is three to five years  publishers may request that the period of a  moving wall  be changed or request discontinuation of coverage  formerly  publishers also could request that the  moving wall  be changed to a  fixed wall a specified date after which jstor would not add new volumes to its database  as of november 2010   fixed wall  agreements were still in effect with three publishers of 29 journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers 
in 2010  jstor started adding current issues of certain journals through its current scholarship program 
increasing public access  
beginning september 6  2011  jstor made public domain content freely available to the public  this  early journal content  program constitutes about 6  of jstor s total content  and includes over 500,000 documents from more than 200 journals that were published before 1923 in the united states  and before 1870 in other countries  jstor stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time  the swartz controversy and greg maxwell s protest
of the same content led jstor to  press ahead  with the initiative 
in january 2012  jstor started a pilot program   register   read   offering limited no-cost access  not   to archived articles for individuals who register for the service  at the conclusion of the pilot  in january 2013  jstor expanded register   read from an initial 76 publishers to include about 1,200 journals from over 700 publishers  registered readers may read up to three articles online every two weeks  but may not print or download pdfs 
this is done by placing up to 3 items on a  shelf   the  shelf  is under  my jstor  below  my profile   the 3 works can then be read online at any time  an item cannot be removed from the shelf until it has been there for 14 days  removing an old work from the shelf creates space for a new one  but doing so means the old work can no longer be accessed until it is shelved again 
jstor is conducting a   whereby established editors are given reading privileges through the wikipedia library  as with a university library 
use  
in 2012  jstor users performed nearly 152 million searches  with more than 113 million article views and 73.5 million article downloads  jstor has been used as a resource for linguistics research to investigate trends in language use over time and also to analyze gender differences in scholarly publishing
