of  newar   or  newar  may be a later form of  nepal   according to another explanation  the words  newar  and  newari  are
arising from the mutation of p to v  and l to r 
nepal is likely singular for nephilim  n p l   which is ancient semitic for protector  sanskrit is formed from the phnician alphabet i e   canaanite aleph-bet

terraced rice farming in nepal
 
is a key part of the national economy  with nepal receiving approx  800,000 foreign visitors each year 
nepal s gross domestic product  gdp  for 2012 was estimated at over  17.921 billion  adjusted to    in 2010  agriculture accounted for 36.1   services comprised 48.5   and industry 15.4  of nepal s gdp  while agriculture and industry are contracting  the contribution by the service sector is increasing 
agriculture employs 76  of the workforce  services 18  and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6   agricultural produce mostly grown in the terai region bordering india includes tea  rice  corn  wheat  sugarcane    milk  and
meat  industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce  including   sugarcane  tobacco  and grain  its workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labor 
nepal s economic growth continues to be adversely affected by the political uncertainty  nevertheless  real gdp growth was estimated to increase to almost 5 percent for 20112012  this is an improvement from the 3.5 percent gdp growth in 20102011 and would be the second-highest growth rate in the post-conflict era  sources of growth include agriculture  construction  financial and other services  the contribution of growth by consumption fueled by remittances has declined since 2010/2011  while remittance growth slowed to 11 percent  in nepali rupee terms  in 2010/2011  it has since increased to 37 percent  remittances are estimated to be equivalent to 2530 percent of gdp  inflation has been reduced to a three-year low of 7 percent 
the proportion of poor people has declined substantially since 2003  the percentage of people living below the international poverty line  people earning less than us 1.25 per day  has halved in seven years  at this measure of poverty the percentage of poor people declined from 53.1  in 2003/2004 to 24.8  in 2010/2011  with a higher poverty line of us 2 per-capita per day  poverty declined by one-quarter to 57.3   however  the income distribution remains grossly uneven 
in a recent survey  nepal has performed extremely well in reducing poverty along with rwanda and bangladesh as the percentage of poor dropped to 44.2 percent of the population in 2011 from 64.7 percent in 20064.1 percentage points per year  which means that nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition  child mortality  electricity  improved flooring and assets  if the progress of reducing poverty continues at this rate  then it is predicted that nepal will halve the current poverty rate and eradicate it within the next 20 years 
the spectacular landscape and diverse  exotic cultures of nepal represent considerable potential for   but growth in the industry has been stifled by political instability and poor infrastructure  despite these problems  in 2012 the number of international tourists visiting nepal was 598,204  a 10  increase on the previous year  the tourism sector contributed nearly 3  of national gdp in 2012 and is the second-biggest foreign income earner after remittances 
the rate of unemployment and underemployment approaches half of the working-age population  thus many nepali citizens move to other countries in search of work  destinations include india  qatar  the united states  thailand  the united kingdom  saudi arabia  japan  brunei darussalam  australia  and canada  nepal receives  50 million a year through the
soldiers who serve in the
and
armies and are highly esteemed for their skill and bravery  as of 2010  the total remittance value is around  3.5 billion  in 2009 alone  the remittance contributed to 22.9  of the nation s gdp 
a long-standing economic agreement underpins a close relationship with india  the country receives foreign aid from the uk  india  japan  the us  the eu  china  switzerland  and scandinavian countries  poverty is acute  per-capita income is around  1,000  the
among the nepali is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries  the highest 10  of households control 39.1  of the national wealth and the lowest 10  control only 2.6  
the government s budget is about  1.153 billion  with an expenditure of  1.789 billion  fy 20005/06   the
has been tied to the
at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years  since the loosening of exchange rate controls in the early 1990s  the black market for foreign exchange has all but disappeared  the inflation rate has dropped to 2.9  after a period of higher inflation during the 1990s 
nepal s exports of mainly carpets  clothing    leather goods 
goods and grain total  822 million  import commodities of mainly gold  machinery and equipment  petroleum products and fertilizer total us 2 billion 
 eu   46.13    the us  17.4    and germany  7.1   are its main export partners  the european union has emerged the largest buyer of nepali ready-made garments  rmg   exports to the eu accounted for  46.13 percent of the country s total garment exports   nepal s import partners include india  47.5    the united arab emirates  11.2    china  10.7    saudi arabia  4.9    and singapore  4   
besides having landlocked  rugged geography  few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure  the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the nation s economic growth and development

energy
main article 
middle marshyandi hydroelectricity dam  nepal has significant potential to generate   which it plans to export across south asia
the bulk of the energy in nepal comes from fuel wood  68    agricultural waste  15    animal dung  8    and imported fossil fuels  8    except for some lignite deposits  nepal has no known oil  gas or coal deposits  all commercial fossil fuels  mainly oil and coal  are either imported from india or from international markets routed through india and china  fuel imports absorb over one-fourth of nepal s foreign exchange earnings 
only about 1  energy need is fulfilled by electricity  the perennial nature of nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country s topography provide ideal conditions for the development of some of the world s largest hydroelectric projects  current estimates put nepal s economically feasible hydropower potential to be approximately 83,000 mw from 66 hydropower project sites  however  currently nepal has been able to exploit only about 600 mw from 20 medium to large hydropower plants and a number of small and micro hydropower plants  there are 9 major hydropower plants under construction  and additional 27 sites considered for potential development  only about 40  of nepal s population has access to electricity  there is a great disparity between urban and rural areas  the electrification rate in urban areas is 90   whereas the rate for rural areas is only 5   power cuts of up to 22 hours a day take place in peak demand periods of winter and the peak electricity demand is almost the double the capability or dependable capacity  the position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs  high system losses  high generation costs  high overheads  over staffing  and lower domestic demand 
transport
main article 
nepal remains isolated from the world s major land  air and sea transport routes although  within the country  aviation is in a better state  with 47 airports  11 of them with paved runways  flights are frequent and support a sizable traffic  the hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive  in 2007 there were just over 10,142km  6,302mi  of paved roads  and 7,140km  4,437mi  of unpaved road  and one 59km  37mi  railway line in the south 
there is a single reliable road route from india to the   more than one-third of its people live at least a two hours walk from the nearest all-season road  15 out of 75 district headquarters are not connected by road  in addition  around 60  of road network and most rural roads are not operable during the rainy season  the only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for kathmandu is
in west bengal state of india  internally  the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets  schools  and health clinics a challenge 
telecommunications and mass media
according to the nepal telecommunication authority mis may 2012 report  there are seven operators and the total voice telephony subscribers including fixed and mobile are 16,350,946 which gives a penetration rate of 61.42   the fixed telephone service account for 9.37   mobile for 64.63   and other services  lm  gmpcs  for 3.76  of the total penetration rate  similarly  the numbers of subscribers to data internet services are 4,667,536 which represents 17.53  penetration rate  most of the data service is accounted by gprs users  twelve months earlier the data internet penetration was 10.05   thus this represents a growth rate of 74.77  
not only has there been strong subscriber growth  especially in the mobile sector  but there was evidence of a clear vision in the sector  including putting a reform process in place and planning for the building of necessary telecommunications infrastructure  most importantly  the ministry of information and communications  moic  and the telecom regulator  the national telecommunications authority  nta   have both been very active in the performance of their respective roles 
despite all the effort  there remained a significant disparity between the high coverage levels in the cities and the coverage available in the underdeveloped rural regions  progress on providing some minimum access had been good  of a total of 3,914 village development committees across the country  306 were unserved by december 2009  in order to meet future demand  it was estimated that nepal needed to invest around us 135 million annually in its telecom sector  in 2009  the telecommunication sector alone contributed to 1  of the nation s gdp  as of 30 september 2012  nepal has 1,828,700 facebook users 
as of 2007  the state operates two television stations as well as national and regional radio stations  there are roughly 30 independent tv channels registered  with only about half in regular operation  nearly 400 fm radio stations are licensed with roughly 300 operational  according to the 2011 census  the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82   television 36.45   cable tv 19.33   computer 7.23   according to the press council nepal  as of 2012 there are 2,038 registered newspapers in nepal  among which 514 are in publication  in 2013 
ranked nepal at 118th place in the world in terms of press freedom 
education
main article 
the overall literacy rate  for population age 5 years and above  increased from 54.1  in 2001 to 65.9  in 2011  the male literacy rate was 75.1  compared to the female literacy rate of 57.4   the highest literacy rate was reported in kathmandu district  86.3   and lowest in
 41.7    while the net primary enrollment rate was 74  in 2005  in 2009  that enrollment rate was 90  
however  increasing access to secondary education  grade 912  remains a major challenge  as evidenced by the low net enrollment rate of 24  at this level  more than half of primary students do not enter secondary schools  and only one-half of them complete secondary schooling  in addition  fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and  among those who do  fewer complete the 10th grade 
nepal has seven universities              and   some newly proposed universities are lumbini bouddha university  and mid-western university  some fine scholarship has emerged in the post-1990 era 
health

kunde hospital in remote himalayan region
public health and health care services in nepal are provided by both the public and private sectors and fare poorly by international standards    according to 2011 census  more than one-third  38.17   of the total households do not have a toilet  tap water is the main source of drinking water for 47.78  of households  tube well hand pump is the main source of drinking water for about 35  of households  while spout  uncovered well kuwa  and covered well kuwa are the main source for 5.74   4.71   and 2.45  respectively  based on 2010 world health organization  who  data  nepal ranked 139th in life expectancy in 2010 with the average nepali living to 65.8 years 
diseases are more prevalent in nepal than in other south asian countries  especially in rural areas  leading diseases and illnesses include          
and   about 4 out of 1,000 adults aged 15 to 49 had
 hiv   and the hiv prevalence rate was 0.5  
also remains very high  about 47  of children under five are stunted  15 percent wasted  and 36 percent underweight  although there has been a declining trend for these rates over the past five years  they remain alarmingly high  in spite of these figures  improvements in health care have been made  most notably in maternal-child health  in 2012  the under-five infant mortality was estimated to be 41 out of every 1000 children  overall nepal s human development index  hdi  for health was 0.77 in 2011  ranking nepal 126 out of 194 countries  up from 0.444 in 1980 
community forestry
the community forestry program in nepal is a participatory environmental governance that encompasses well-defined policies  institutions  and practices  the program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction  as more than 70 percent of nepal s population depends on agriculture for their livelihood  community management of forests has been a critically important intervention  through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades  the program has evolved from a protection-oriented  conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use  enterprise development  and livelihood improvement  by april 2009  one-third of nepal s population was participating in the program  directly managing more than one-fourth of nepal s forest area 
the immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources  community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods  community forestry shows traits of political  financial  and ecological sustainability  including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework  and robust civil society institutions and networks  however  a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups  lessons for replication emphasize experiential learning  establishment of a strong civil society network  flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities  and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process

in the country  however  the college was not accessible to the general public  but only to a handful of members of the   throughout the rana regime that lasted for well over a century  nepal was effectively isolated from the rest of the world  owing to this isolation  nepal was relatively untouched by and unfamiliar of social transformations brought about by the

an underdeveloped country  nepal is plagued with problems like       etc  consequently  science and technology have invariably lagged behind in the priority list of the government  on the other hand  citing poor university education at home  tens of thousands of nepali students leave the country every year  with half of them never returning  these factors have been huge deterrents to the development of science and technology in nepal
