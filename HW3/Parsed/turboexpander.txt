a turboexpander  also referred to as a turbo-expander or an expansion turbine  is a centrifugal or axial flow
through which a high
is expanded to produce work that is often used to drive a  
because work is extracted from the expanding high pressure gas  the expansion is approximated by an
process  i e   a constant
process  and the low pressure exhaust gas from the turbine is at a very low   150c or less depending upon the operating pressure and gas properties  partial liquefaction of the expanded gas is not uncommon 
turboexpanders are very widely used as sources of
in industrial processes such as the extraction of
and
 ngls  from   the
 such as      
and   and other low-temperature processes 
turboexpanders currently in operation range in size from about 750
to about 7.5 mw  1
to about 10,000hp

applications  
although turboexpanders are very commonly used in low-temperature processes  they are used in many other applications as well  this section discusses one of the low temperature processes as well as some of the other applications 
extracting hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas  
figure 2  a schematic diagram of a demethanizer extracting hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas 
raw natural gas consists primarily of methane  ch4   the shortest and lightest
molecule  as well as various amounts of heavier hydrocarbon gases such as
 c2h6  
 c3h8  
 n-c4h10  
 i-c4h10  
and even higher
hydrocarbons  the raw gas also contains various amounts of
such as
 co2  
 h2s  and
such as
 ch3sh  and
 c2h5sh  
when processed into finished by-products  see    these heavier hydrocarbons are collectively referred to as ngl  natural gas liquids   the extraction of the ngl often involves a turboexpander and a low-temperature
 called a demethanizer  as shown in figure 2  the inlet gas to the demethanizer is first cooled to about 51c in a
 referred to as a cold box  which partially
the inlet gas  the resultant gas-liquid mixture is then separated into a gas stream and a liquid stream 
the liquid stream from the
flows through a valve and undergoes a
from an absolute pressure of 62 bar to 21 bar  6.2 to 2.1 mpa   which is an
process  i e   a constant enthalpy process  that results in lowering the temperature of the stream from about 51c to about 81c as the stream enters the demethanizer 
the gas stream from the gas-liquid separator enters the turboexpander where it undergoes an
expansion from an absolute pressure of 62 bar to 21 bar  6.2 to 2.1 mpa  that lowers the gas stream temperature from about 51c to about 91c as it enters the demethanizer to serve as distillation  
liquid from the top
of the demethanizer  at about 90c  is routed through the cold box where it is warmed to about 0c as it cools the inlet gas  and is then returned to the lower section of the demethanizer  another liquid stream from the lower section of the demethanizer  at about 2c  is routed through the cold box and returned to the demethanizer at about 12c  in effect  the inlet gas provides the
required to  reboil  the bottom of the demethanizer and the turboexpander removes the heat required to provide reflux in the top of the demethanizer 
the overhead gas product from the demethanizer at about 90c is processed natural gas that is of suitable quality for distribution to end-use consumers by   it is routed through the cold box where it is warmed as it cools the inlet gas  it is then compressed in the gas compressor which is driven by the turbo expander and further compressed in a second-stage gas compressor driven by an
before entering the distribution pipeline 
the bottom product from the demethanizer is also warmed in the cold box  as it cools the inlet gas  before it leaves the system as ngl 
power generation  
figure 3  schematic diagram of power generation system using a turboexpander 
figure 3 depicts an electric power generation system that uses a heat source  a cooling medium  air  water or other   a circulating working fluid and a turboexpander  the system can accommodate a wide variety of heat sources such as 
geothermal hot water
exhaust gas from internal combustion engines burning a variety of fuels        or  
a variety of waste heat sources  in the form of either gas or liquid 
referring to figure 3  the circulating working fluid  usually an
such as r-134a  is pumped to a high pressure and then vaporized in the evaporator by
with the available heat source  the resulting high-pressure vapor flows to the turboexpander where it undergoes an isentropic expansion and exits as a vapor-liquid mixture which is then condensed into a liquid by heat exchange with the available cooling medium  the condensed liquid is pumped back to the evaporator to complete the cycle 
the system in figure 3 is a
as is used in
where water is the working fluid and the heat source is derived from the
of natural gas 
or
used to generate high-pressure steam  the high-pressure steam then undergoes an isentropic expansion in a conventional   the steam turbine exhaust steam is next condensed into liquid water which is then pumped back to steam generator to complete the cycle 
when an organic working fluid such as r-134a is used in the rankine cycle  the cycle is sometimes referred to as an
 orc  
refrigeration system  
figure 4  schematic diagram of a refrigeration system using a turboexpander  compressor and a motor 
figure 4 depicts a refrigeration system with a capacity of about 100 to 1000
 i e   350 to 3,500kw   the system utilizes a compressor  a turboexpander and an electric motor 
depending on the operating conditions  the turboexpander reduces the load on the electric motor by some 6 to 15  as compared to a conventional
system that uses a
valve rather than a turboexpander  basically  this can be seen as a form of  
the system employs a high-pressure refrigerant  i e   one with a low   such as 
 chclf2  known as r-22  with a normal boiling point of 47c
 c2h2f4  known as r-134a  with a normal boiling point of 26c 
as shown in figure 4  refrigerant vapor is compressed to a higher pressure resulting in a higher temperature as well  the hot  compressed vapor is then
into a liquid  the
is where heat is expelled from the circulating refrigerant and is carried away by whatever cooling medium is used in the condenser  air  water  etc   
the refrigerant liquid flows through the turboexpander where it is vaporized and the vapor undergoes an isentropic expansion which results in a low-temperature mixture of vapor and liquid  the vapor-liquid mixture is then routed through the evaporator where it is vaporized by heat absorbed from the space being cooled  the vaporized refrigerant flows to the compressor inlet to complete the cycle 
power recovery in fluid catalytic cracker  
figure 5  a schematic diagram of the power recovery system in a fluid catalytic cracking unit 
the
from the catalyst regenerator of a
is at a temperature of about 715c and at a pressure of about 2.4
 240 kpa gauge   its gaseous components are mostly
 co  
 co2  and
 n2   although the flue gas has been through two stages of
 located within the regenerator  to remove entrained catalyst fines  it still contains some residual catalyst fines 
figure 5 depicts how power is recovered and utilized by routing the regenerator flue gas through a turboexpander  after the flue gas exits the regenerator  it is routed through a secondary catalyst separator containing
designed to remove 70 to 90 percent of the residual catalyst fines  this is required to prevent erosion damage to the turboexpander 
as shown in figure 5  expansion of the flue gas through a turboexpander provides sufficient power to drive the regenerator s combustion air compressor  the electrical
in the power recovery system can consume or produce electrical power  if the expansion of the flue gas does not provide enough power to drive the air compressor  the electric motor-generator provides the needed additional power  if the flue gas expansion provides more power than needed to drive the air compressor  than the electric motor-generator converts the excess power into electric power and exports it to the refinery s electrical system  the
shown in figure 5 is used to drive the regenerator s combustion air compressor during start-ups of the fluid catalytic cracker until there is sufficient combustion flue gas to take over that task 
the expanded flue gas is then routed through a steam-generating
 referred to as a   where the carbon monoxide in the flue gas is burned as fuel to provide steam for use in the refinery 
the flue gas from the co boiler is processed through an
 esp  to remove residual   the esp removes particulates in the size range of 2 to 20
from the flue gas 
history  
the possible use of an expansion machine for isentropically creating low temperatures was suggested by
    a
engineer in 1857  about three decades later  in 1885  ernest solvay of
attempted to use a reciprocating expander machine but could not attain any temperatures lower than 98c because of problems with lubrication of the machine at such temperatures 
in 1902    a
engineer  successfully used a reciprocating expansion machine to liquefy air  he used a degreased  burnt leather packing as a piston seal without any lubrication  with an air pressure of only 40 bar  4 mpa   claude achieved an almost isentropic expansion resulting in a lower temperature than had before been possible 
the first turboexpanders seem to have been designed in about 1934 or 1935 by guido zerkowitz  an italian engineer working for the german firm of  
in 1939  the
physicist
perfected the design of centrifugal turboexpanders  his first practical prototype was made of
metal  had an outside diameter of only 8cm  3.1in   operated at 40,000 revolutions per minute and expanded 1,000 cubic metres of air per hour  it used a water pump as a brake and had an efficiency of 79 to 83 percent  most turboexpanders in industrial use since then have been based on kapitsa s design and centrifugal turboexpanders have taken over almost 100 percent of the industrial gas liquefaction and low temperature process requirements  the availability of liquid
revolutionized the production of steel using the
process 
in 1978  pyotr kapitsa was awarded a nobel physics prize for his body of work in the area of low-temperature physics 
in 1983  san diego gas and electric was among the first to install a turboexpander in a natural gas letdown station for
types  
turboexpanders can be classified by loading device or bearings 
three main loading devices used in turboexpanders are   electrical generators or hydraulic brakes  with centrifugal compressors and electrical generators the shaft power from the turboexpander is recouped either to recompress the process gas or to generate electrical energy lowering utility bills 
hydraulic brakes are used when the turboexpander is very small and harvesting the shaft power is not economically justifiable 
bearings used are either oil bearings or
