flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion refers to the -product gas resulting from the burning of   most fossil fuels are combusted with ambient air  as differentiated from combustion with pure    since ambient air contains about 79 volume percent gaseous
 n2   which is essentially non-combustible  the largest part of the
from most fossil-fuel combustion is uncombusted nitrogen 
 co2   the next largest part of flue gas  can be as much as 1025 volume percent or more of the flue gas  this is closely followed in volume by water vapor  h2o  created by the combustion of the hydrogen in the fuel with atmospheric oxygen  much of the  smoke  seen pouring from
is this water vapor forming a cloud as it contacts cool air 
a typical flue gas from the combustion of fossil fuels contains very small amounts of
 nox  
 so2  and   the nitrogen oxides are derived from the nitrogen in the ambient air as well as from any nitrogen-containing compounds in the fossil fuel  the sulfur dioxide is derived from any -containing compounds in the fuels  the particulate matter is composed of very small particles of solid materials and very small liquid droplets which give flue gases their smoky appearance

burn considerable amounts of fossil fuels and therefore emit large amounts of flue gas to the ambient atmosphere  the table below presents the total amounts of flue gas typically generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as

calculations 
it is of interest to note that the total amount of flue gas generated by coal combustion is only 10 percent higher than the flue gas generated by natural-gas combustion
