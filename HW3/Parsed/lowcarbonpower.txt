low-carbon power
low-carbon power comes from processes or technologies that  produce power with substantially lower amounts of
emissions than is emitted from conventional
  it includes low carbon power generation sources such as    
and  including fuel preparation and decommissioning    the term largely excludes conventional fossil fuel plant sources  and is only used to describe a particular subset of operating fossil fuel power systems  specifically  those that are successfully coupled with a
 ccs  system

history  
over the past 30 years    significant findings regarding
highlighted the need to curb carbon emissions  from this  the idea for low carbon power was born  the
 ipcc   established by the
 wmo  and the
 unep  in 1988  set the scientific precedence for the introduction of low carbon power  the ipcc has continued to provide scientific  technical and socio-economic advice to the world community  through its periodic assessment reports and special reports 
internationally  the most prominent early step in the direction of low carbon power was the signing of the   which came into force on february 16  2005  under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions  the historical event set the political precedence for introduction of low carbon power technology 
on a social level  perhaps the biggest factor contributing to the general publics awareness of climate change and the need for new technologies  including low carbon power  came from the documentary   which clarified and highlighted the problem of global warming 
power sources by carbon dioxide emissions  
main article 
vattenfall study  
the swedish utility
did a study of full life cycle emissions of nuclear  hydro  coal  gas  solar cell  peat and wind which the utility uses to produce electricity  the net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3grams of carbon dioxide per kw-hr of produced power  this compares to 400 for
and 700 for
 according to this study   the study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of co2 of any of their electricity sources 
sovacool life cycle study survey  
sovacool says that the mean value of co2 emissions for nuclear power over the life cycle of a plant was 66.08 g kwh 
a 2008    valuing the use gas emissions from nuclear power  a critical survey   by   analysed 103 life cycle studies of greenhouse gas-equivalent emissions for nuclear power plants  the studies surveyed included the 1997 vattenfall comparative emissions study  among others  sovacool s analysis calculated that the mean value of emissions over the lifetime of a nuclear power plant is 66 g kwh  comparative results for       and   were 9-10 g kwh  10-13 g kwh  13 g kwh and 32 g kwh respectively  sovacool s analysis has been criticized for poor methodology and data selection 
yale university life cycle analysis of nuclear power  
a 2012
 lca  review by
said that  depending on conditions  median life cycle
emissions  for nuclear electricity generation technologies  could be 9 to 110 g co2-eq kwh by 2050   it stated 
 the collective lca literature indicates that life cycle ghg emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies  
it added that for the most common category of reactors  the
 lwr  
 harmonization decreased the
estimate for all lwr technology categories so that the
of     and all lwrs are similar  at approximately 12 g co2-eq kwh 
differentiating attributes of low-carbon power sources  
there are many options for lowering current levels of carbon emissions  some options  such as wind power and solar power  produce low quantities of total life cycle carbon emissions  using entirely renewable sources  other options  such as nuclear power  produce a comparable amount of carbon dioxide emissions as renewable technologies in total life cycle emissions  but consume non-renewable  but sustainable materials     the term low carbon power can also include power that continues to utilize the worlds natural resources  such as natural gas and coal  but only when they employ techniques that reduce carbon dioxide emissions from these sources when burning them for fuel  such as the  as of 2012  pilot plants performing  
as the single
of carbon dioxide in the united states  the electric-power industry accounted for 39  of co2 emissions in 2004  a 27  increase since 1990  because the cost of reducing emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors such as transportation  the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy 
technologies to produce electric power with low-carbon emissions are already in use at various scales  together  they account for roughly 28  of all u s  electric-power production  with nuclear power representing the majority  20    followed by hydroelectric power  7    however  demand for power is increasing  driven by increased population and per capita demand  and low carbon power can supplement the supply needed

according to a transatlantic collaborative research paper on  eroei   conducted by 6 analysts led by d  weibach  and described as     the most extensive overview so far based on a careful evaluation of available    which was published in the
journal energy in 2013  the uncorrected for their   unbuffered   eroei for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right  while the buffered corrected for their   eroei stated in the paper for all low carbon power sources  with the exception of nuclear and biomass  were yet lower still  as when corrected for their weather intermittency  buffered   the eroei figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished - a reduction of eroei dependent on  
although the methodological integrity of this paper was challenged by  marco raugei  in late 2013  the authors of the initial paper responded to each of raugei s concerns in 2014  and after analysis  each of raugei s concerns were summarized as  not scientifically justified  and based on faulty eroei understandings due to  politically motivated energy evaluations  
examples of low carbon power technology  
the 2014 intergovernmental panel on climate change report identifies nuclear  wind  solar and hydroelectricity in suitable locations as technologies that can provide electricity with less than 5  of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power 
hydroelectric power  
the
when completed in 1936 was both the world s largest electric-power generating station and the world s largest concrete structure 
plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years  hydropower is also an extremely flexible technology from the perspective of power grid operation  large hydropower provides one of the lowest cost options in todays energy market  even compared to fossil fuels and there are no harmful emissions associated with plant operation  however there are typically low greenhouse gas emissions with   and possibly high emissions in the tropics 
hydroelectric power is the worlds largest low carbon source of electricity  supplying 16.6  of total electricity in 2014 
is by far the world s largest producer of
in the world  followed by
and  
however  there are several significant social and environmental disadvantages of large-scale hydroelectric power systems  dislocation  if people are living where the reservoirs are planned  release of
during construction and flooding of the reservoir  and disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife  there is a strong consensus now that countries should adopt an integrated approach towards managing water resources  which would involve planning hydropower development in co-operation with other water-using sectors 
nuclear power  
blue
light being produced near the core of the fission powered
  with a 10.6  share of world electricity production as of 2013  is the second largest low-carbon power source 
nuclear power  in 2010  also provided two thirds 2/3  of the twenty seven nation  s low-carbon energy  with for example some eu nations sourcing a considerable amount of their electricity from nuclear power  for example  
according to the
and   worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries in 2013  china has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction  as of 2013  with plans to build many more  while in the us the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60years  and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration  there are also a considerable number of new reactors being built in south korea  india  and russia 
this graph illustrates
is the united states s largest contributor of non-greenhouse-gas-emitting electric power generation  comprising nearly three-quarters of the non-emitting sources 
nuclear power s capability to add significantly to future low carbon energy growth depends on several factors  including the economics of new reactor designs  such as   public opinion and national and regional politics 
the 104 u s  nuclear plants are undergoing a   to sustainably extend the life span of the u s  nuclear fleet by a further 20 years  with further us power plants under construction in 2013  such as the two
at   however the
are still evolving and plans to add to those plants are mostly in flux

worldwide installed wind power capacity  source   
worldwide there are now over two hundred thousand wind turbines operating  with a total
of 238,351mw as of end 2011  while not correcting for wind power s comparatively low  30    the european union alone passed some 100,000 mw
in september 2012  while the united states surpassed 50,000 mw in august 2012 and
passed 50,000 mw the same month  world wind generation capacity more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006  doubling about every three years 
and led the world in installed capacity in the 1980s and into the 1990s  in 1997 german installed capacity surpassed the u s  and led until once again overtaken by the u s  in 2008  china has been rapidly expanding its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the u s  in 2010 to become the world leader 
at the end of 2011  worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 238
 gw   growing by 40.5 gw of nameplate capacity over the preceding year  between 2005 and 2010 the average annual growth in new installations was 27.6 percent  according to the   an industry organization  in 2010 wind power generated 430 twh or about 2.5  of worldwide electricity usage  up from 1.5  in 2008 and 0.1  in 1997  wind power s share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1   several countries have already achieved relatively high levels of penetration  such as 28  of stationary  grid  electricity production in

solar power  
main article 
the
concentrates sunlight from a field of heliostats on a central tower 
solar power is the conversion of
into electricity  either directly using
 pv   or indirectly using
 csp   concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  photovoltaics convert light into electric current using the  
commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s  the 354 mw
csp installation is the largest solar power plant in the world  located in the
of california  other large csp plants include the
 150 mw  and the
 150 mw   both in spain  the over 200 mw
in the united states  and the 214 mw
in india  are the
  solar power s share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1  
geothermal power  
main article 
geothermal electricity is
from geothermal energy  technologies in use include dry steam power plants  flash steam power plants and binary cycle power plants  geothermal electricity generation is used in 24 countries while
is in use in 70 countries 
current worldwide installed capacity is 10,715 megawatts  mw   with the largest capacity in the
 3,086 mw     and   estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from 35 to 2000gw 
geothermal power is considered to be
because the heat extraction is small compared to the earth s heat content  the
of existing geothermal electric plants is on average 122kg of co
2 per megawatt-hour  mwh  of electricity  a small fraction of that of conventional fossil fuel plants 
tidal power  
is a form of
that converts the energy of tides into electricity or other useful forms of power  the first large-scale tidal power plant  the   started operation in 1966  although not yet widely used  tidal power has potential for future electricity generation  tides are more predictable than wind energy and solar power 
carbon capture and storage

captures carbon dioxide from the
of power plants or other industry  transporting it to an appropriate location where it can be buried securely in an underground reservoir  while the technologies involved are all in use  and carbon capture and storage is occurring in other industries  e g   at the    no large scale integrated project has yet become operational within the power industry 
improvements to current carbon capture and storage technologies could reduce co2 capture costs by at least 20-30  over approximately the next decade  while new technologies under development promise more substantial cost reduction

emissions  
greenhouse gas emissions by sector  see
for detailed breakdown
the
stated in its first working group report that most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in
greenhouse gas concentrations  contribute to  
as a percentage of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
 co2  accounts for 72 percent  and has increased in concentration in the atmosphere from 315 parts per million  ppm  in 1958 to more than 375 ppm in 2005 
emissions from energy make up more than 61.4 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions  power generation from traditional coal fuel sources accounts for 18.8 percent of all world greenhouse gas emissions  nearly double that emitted by road transportation 
estimates state that by 2020 the world will be producing around twice as much carbon emissions as it was in 2000 
electricity usage  
world co2 emissions by region
world energy consumption is predicted to increase from 421 quadrillion british thermal units  btu  in 2003 to 722 quadrillion btu in 2030  coal consumption is predicted to nearly double in that same time  the fastest growth is seen in non- asian countries  especially china and india  where economic growth drives increased energy use  by implementing low carbon power options  world electricity demand could continue to grow while maintaining stable carbon emission levels 
in the transportation sector there are moves away from fossil fuels and towards electric vehicles  such as
and the   these trends are small  but may eventually add a large demand to the electrical grid 
domestic and industrial heat and hot water have largely been supplied by burning fossil fuels such as fuel oil or natural gas at the consumers premises  some countries have begun heat pump rebates to encourage switching to electricity  potentially adding a large demand to the grid 
energy infrastructure  
2/3 of world coal capacity is yet to be built
by 2015  one-third of the 2007 u s  coal plants will be more than 50 years old  nearly two-thirds of the generation capacity required to meet power demand in 2030 is yet to be built  there were 151 new coal-fired power plants planned for the u s   providing 90gw of power  by 2012  that had dropped to 15  mostly due to new rules limiting mercury emissions  and limiting carbon emissions to 1,000 pounds of co2 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced 
investment  
investment in low carbon power sources and technologies is increasing at a rapid rate  zero-carbon power sources produce about 2  of the world s energy  but account for about 18  of world investment in power generation  attracting  100 billion of investment capital in 2006
