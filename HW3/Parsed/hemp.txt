hemp grown for animal feed
hemp or industrial hemp  from
   typically found in the northern hemisphere  is a
of the
plant species that is grown specifically for the industrial uses of its derived products  it is one of the fastest growing plants and was one of the first plants to be spun into usable
10,000 years ago  it can be refined into a variety of commercial items including paper    clothing  biodegradable plastics  paint  insulation  biofuel  food  and animal feed 
although
and industrial hemp are both members of the species cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component
 thc   they are distinct strains with unique biochemical compositions and uses  hemp has lower concentrations of thc and higher concentrations of
 cbd   which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects  the
varies widely between countries  some governments regulate the concentration of thc and permit hemp that s bred with an especially low thc content

etymology  
further information 
the etymology is uncertain but there appears to be no common
source for the various forms of the word  the greek term knnabis is the oldest attested form  which may have been borrowed from an earlier
or
word  then it appears to have been borrowed into latin  and separately into slavic and from there into baltic  finnish  and   following   the  k  would have changed to  h  with the first germanic sound shift  after which it may have been adapted into the old english form  hnep  however  this theory assumes that hemp was not widely spread among different societies until after it was already being used as a psychoactive drug  which adams and mallory  1997  believe to be unlikely based on archaeological evidence 
 1991  however  argued that the spread of the name  kannabis  was due to its historically more recent drug use  starting from the south  around iran  whereas non-thc varieties of hemp are older and prehistoric  another possible source of origin is assyrian qunnabu  which was the name for a source of oil  fiber  and medicine in the 1st millennium bc 
of hemp in other germanic languages  include dutch hennep  danish and norwegian  hamp  german  hanf  and swedish  hampa 
uses  
hemp seed
hemp is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products including rope  clothes  food  paper  textiles  plastics  insulation and biofuel  the
can be used to make textiles that are 100  hemp  but they are commonly blended with other organic fibers such as   cotton or silk  to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings  the inner two fibers of the plant are more woody and typically have industrial applications  such as mulch  animal bedding and litter  when
 commonly referred to as  drying   
from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints  in creams as a moisturizing agent  for cooking  and in plastics  hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well    a survey in 2003 showed that more than 95  of hemp seed sold in the
was used in animal and bird feed   
food  
hemp seed
hemp seeds can be eaten raw  ground into a meal    or made into dried sprout powder  the leaves of the hemp plant can be consumed raw in salads  hemp can also be made into a liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as       and tea 
is cold-pressed from the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids  in 2011  the u s  imported  11.5 million worth of hemp products  mostly driven by growth in demand for hemp seed and hemp oil for use as ingredients in foods such as granola 
in the uk  the
 defra  treats hemp as a purely non-food crop  but with proper licensing and proof of less than 0.2  thc concentration  hemp seeds can be imported for sowing or for sale as a food or food ingredient  in the u s   imported hemp can be used legally in food products and as of 2000  was typically sold in health food stores or through mail order

fiber  
hemp stem showing fibers 
hemp fiber has been used extensively throughout history  with production climaxing soon after being introduced to the new world  items ranging from rope  to fabrics  to industrial materials were made from hemp fiber  hemp was often used to make sail   and the word canvas derives from cannabis  today  a modest hemp fabric industry exists  and hemp fibers can be used in clothing  pure hemp has a texture similar to

processing  
traditionally the hemp stalks would be water- first before the fibers were beaten off the inner hurd by hand  a process known as scrutching  as mechanical technology evolved  separating the fiber from the core was accomplished by crushing rollers and brush rollers that would produce a nearly clean fiber  after the
was implemented in 1938  the technology for separating the fibers from the core remained  frozen in time  
only in 1997  starting with ireland  did the
and then other countries begin to legally grow

building material  
main article 
concrete-like blocks made with hemp and lime have been used as an insulating material for construction  such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements  they must be supported by a brick  wood  or steel frame  however hemp fibres are extremely strong and durable  and have been shown to be usable as a replacement for wood for many jobs including creating very durable and breathable homes 
the first example of the use of hempcrete was in 1986 in france with the renovation of the maison de la turque in
by the innovator charles rasetti  in the uk hemp lime was first used in 2000 for the construction of two test dwellings in haverhill  designed by modece architects  who pioneered hemp s use in uk construction  the hemp houses were monitored in comparison with other standard dwellings by bre  completed in 2009  the renewable house is one of the most technologically advanced made from hemp-based materials  the first us home made of hemp-based materials was completed in august 2010 in asheville  north carolina

and
ancient sanskrit on hemp based paper  hemp fiber was commonly used in the production of paper from 200 bce to the late 1800 s 
before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles  called rags  the rags were from hemp 
and   a process for removing printing inks from
was invented by german jurist
in 1774  today this method is called   it was not until the introduction of
in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from  
history and development  
with hemp fiber excavated from the
of
 140-87 bc  at   xi an 
the first identified coarse   made from hemp  dates to the early   two hundred years before the nominal invention of
by   who improved and standardized paper production using a range of inexpensive materials  including hemp ends  approximately 2000 years ago  recycled hemp clothing  rags and fishing nets were used as inputs for paper production 
the   paper mill of goznak opened in 1818  it used hemp as its main input material  paper from the mill was used in the printing of    stamped paper  credit bills  postal stamps  bonds  stocks  and other
paper  
in 1916  u s  department of agriculture chief scientists
and jason l  merrill created paper made from hemp pulp and concluded that paper from hemp hurds was  favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood   the chemical composition of hemp hurds is similar to that of wood  making hemp a good choice as a raw material for manufacturing paper  modern research has not confirmed the positive finding about hemp hurds from 1916  a later book about hemp and other fibers by the same l h  dewey 1943  have no words about hemp as a raw material for production of paper  dried hemp has about 57 
 the principal ingredient in paper   compared to about 40-50  in wood  hemp also has the advantage of a lower lignin content  hemp contains only 5-24  lignin against the 20-35  found in wood  this lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process  the actual production of hemp fiber in the u s continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons year  between 1934-35  the cultivation of hemp began to increase but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp 
contemporary  
currently there is a small niche market for hemp pulp  for example as cigarette paper  hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp  in 1994 there was no significant production of 100  true hemp paper  world hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05  of the world s annual pulp production volume  the total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons  this can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber  which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum  the cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp  mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the western world  and because hemp is harvested once a year  during august    and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through  this storage requires a lot of  mostly manual  handling of the bulky stalk bundles  another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production  while the wood products industry uses nearly 100  of the fiber from harvested trees  only about 25  of the dried hemp stem  the bark  called bast  contains the long  strong fibers desirable for paper production  all this accounts for a high raw material cost  hemp pulp is bleached with   a process today also commonly used for wood pulp 
market share  
around the year 2000  the production quantity of flax and hemp pulp total 25000-30000 tons per year  having been produced from approximately 37000-45000 tonnes fibers  up to 80  of the produced pulp is used for specialty papers  including 95  of    only about 20  hemp fiber input goes into the standard pulp area and are here mostly in lower quality  untreated
high
content added  wood pulps  with hemp pulp alone  the proportion of specialty papers probably at about 99   the market is considered saturated with little or no growth in this area

hemp shives are the core of the stem  hemp hurds are broken parts of the core  in the eu  they are used for animal bedding  horses  for instance   or for horticultural mulch  industrial hemp is much more profitable if both fibers and shives  or even seeds  can be used 
water and soil purification  
hemp can be used as a  mop crop  to clear impurities out of wastewater  such as sewage effluent  excessive phosphorus from chicken litter  or other unwanted substances or chemicals  additionally hemp is being used to clean contaminants at the

cultivation  
hemp being harvested
hemp is usually planted between march and may in the northern hemisphere  between september and november in the southern hemisphere  it matures in about three to four months 
millennia of
have resulted in
that look quite different  also  breeding since circa 1930 has focused quite specifically on producing strains which would perform very poorly as sources of drug material  hemp grown for fiber is planted closely  resulting in tall  slender plants with long fibers   until the early 1900s industrial hemp was a valuable crop used all over the world for its strong fibers and oil seeds  today  however  the common perception of the industrial hemp plant is generally negative and associated with the drug   this perception is the legacy of a century of powerful influences construing hemp as a dangerous drug  even though it is not a drug and it has the potential to be a profitable alternative crop  in the united states  the public s perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product   in spite of its vital importance prior to world war ii  ideally  according to britain s   the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering  this early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality  in these strains of industrial hemp the
 thc  content would have been very low 
the seeds are sown from mid-april to mid-may with grain drills to 46cm sowing depth  hemp needs less fertilizer than corn does  a total of 60150kg of nitrogen  40140kg phosphorus  p2o5  and 75200kg of potassium  5  per acre for hemp fiber made before sowing and again later  maybe three to four weeks  when practiced  especially in france double use of fiber and seed fertilization with nitrogen doses up to 100kg  
rather low  organic fertilizers such as manure can utilize industrial hemp well  neither weeds nor crop protection measures are necessary 
cultivars  
stem
hemp strains uso-xx and zolotoniski-xx
a total of 26 varieties of hemp with low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol  thc  are certified by the
 eu   they have  unlike other types  a very high fiber content of 30-40   in contrast to cannabis for medical use  varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.2  thc and they are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana  the most important cannabinoid in industrial hemp is
 cbd  with a proportion of 1 to 5    
the variety of appearances for cannabis  only c  sativa  left  is suited for industrial hemp  but it also has medicinal varieties 
cannabis sativa l  subsp  sativa var  sativa is the variety grown for industrial use  while c  sativa subsp  indica generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes  the major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance  and the amount of 9-  thc  secreted in a resinous mixture by
hairs called glandular   although they can also be distinguished genetically  oilseed and fiber varieties of cannabis approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug  not enough for any physical or psychological effects  typically  hemp contains below 0.3  thc  while cultivars of cannabis grown for medicinal or recreational use can contain anywhere from 2  to over 20  
harvesting  
industrial hempseed harvesting machine in  
smallholder plots are usually harvested by hand  the plants are cut at 2 to 3cm above the soil and left on the ground to dry  mechanical harvesting is now common  using specially adapted cutter-binders or simpler cutters 
the cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry for up to four days  this was traditionally followed by   either water retting  the bundled hemp floats in water  or dew retting  the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew  and by molds and
action  
location and crop rotation  
hemp maze in france
for profitable hemp farming  particularly deep  -rich  nutrient-rich soil with controlled water flow is preferable  water logged acidic  compressed or extremely light  sandy  soils primarily affect the early development of plants    steep and high altitudes of more than 400 m above sea level are best avoided  hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to -5 degrees c    seeds can germinate down to 1-3 degrees    hemp needs a lot of heat  so earlier varieties come to maturation  the water requirement is 300-500 l   kg dry matter    up to 3 feet growing roots into the soil can also use water supplies from deeper soil layers  worth noting is that the water requirement of hemp is at least 14 times lower than that of cotton which takes between 7 000-29 000 l kg  according to wwf   
hemp benefits crops grown after it  for this reason  it is generally grown before winter cereals  advantageous changes are high weed suppression  soil loosening by the large hemp root system and the positive effect on soil   since hemp is very self-compatible  it can also be grown several years in a row in the same fields  monoculture  
diseases  
main article 
hemp plants can be vulnerable to various   including      
and other miscellaneous pathogens  such diseases often lead to reduced fiber quality  stunted growth  and death of the plant  these diseases rarely affect the yield of a hemp field  so hemp production is not traditionally dependent on the use of pesticides 
environmental impact  
hemp is considered by a 1998 study in
to be
due to a decrease of
and other environmental impacts  indicating a possible decrease of
in a us context compared to typical benchmarks  a 2010 study  however  that compared the production of
specifically from hemp and
concluded that  industrial hemp presents higher environmental impacts than eucalyptus paper   however  the article also highlights that  there is scope for improving industrial hemp paper production   hemp is also claimed to require few
and no herbicides  and it has been called a
raw material  results indicate that high yield of hemp may require high total nutrient levels  field plus fertilizer nutrients  similar to a high yielding wheat crop

and  most recently    the state governments have issued licences to grow hemp for industrial use  the first to initiate modern research into the potential of cannabis was the state of tasmania pioneered the licensing of hemp during the early 1990s  the state of victoria was an early adopter in 1998  and has reissued the regulation in 2008 
queensland has allowed industrial production under licence since 2002  where the issuance is controlled under the drugs misuse act 1986  most recently  new south wales now issues licences under a law  the hemp industry regulations act 2008  no 58   that came into effect as of 6 november 2008

crops in
 glukhov   ukraine  has been one of the world s largest centers for developing new hemp varieties  focusing on improving fiber quality  per-hectare yields  and low

for use in a wide variety of products  as well as the seed for nutritional aspects and for the oil  feral hemp or ditch weed is usually a naturalized fibre or oilseed strain of cannabis that has escaped from cultivation and is self-seeding 
united states  
hemp was made illegal to grow without a permit in the u s  under the
passed in 1970 because of its relation to marijuana  and any imported hemp products must meet a
level  some states have made the cultivation of industrial hemp legal  but farmers in many states have not yet begun to grow it because of resistance from the federal   in 2013  after the legalization of cannabis in the state  several farmers in colorado planted and harvested several acres of hemp  bringing in the first hemp crop in the united states in over half a century  colorado  vermont  california  and north dakota have passed laws enabling hemp licensure  all four states are waiting for permission to grow hemp from the dea  currently  oregon has licensed industrial hemp as of august 2009  congress included a provision in the
that allowed colleges and state agencies to grow and conduct research on hemp in states where it is legal 
as of 2015 the hemp industry estimated that annual sales of hemp products were around us 580 million annually  hemp seeds have been the major force driving this growth 
yet  even with this progress  hemp businesses seem to face difficulty expanding in the us as they face challenges in traditional marketing and sales approaches  according to the case study done by forbes  hemp businesses and startups  such as ministry of hemp  have had difficulty marketing and selling non-psychoactive hemp products  as social media and financial institutions refuse to distinguish between hemp and marijuana

 ca  4800 bce 
with impressed hemp cord design
    the
for hemp  depicts two plants under a shelter  the use of hemp in taiwan dates back at least 10,000 years 
hemp is one of the earliest domesticated plants known  it has been cultivated by many civilizations for over 12,000 years  hemp use archaeologically dates back to the
in china  with hemp fiber imprints found on
pottery dating from the   the chinese later used hemp to make clothes  shoes  ropes  and an early form of   the classical greek historian
 ca  480 bc  reported that the inhabitants of
would often inhale the vapors of hemp-seed smoke  both as ritual and for their own pleasurable recreation 
textile expert
summarizes the historical evidence that cannabis sativa   grew and was known in the neolithic period all across the northern latitudes  from europe  germany  switzerland  austria  romania  ukraine  to east asia  tibet and china    but   textile use of cannabis sativa does not surface for certain in the west until relatively late  namely the iron age    i strongly suspect  however  that what catapulted hemp to sudden fame and fortune as a cultigen and caused it to spread rapidly westwards in the first millennium b c  was the spread of the habit of pot-smoking from somewhere in south-central asia  where the drug-bearing variety of the plant originally occurred  the linguistic evidence strongly supports this theory  both as to time and direction of spread and as to cause  
jews living in
in the 2nd century were familiar with the cultivation of hemp  as witnessed by a reference to it in the
  2 5  as a variety of plant  along with   that sometimes takes as many as three years to grow from a seedling  in
and   hemp was employed in cooked dishes  as filling in
and   or boiled in a   hemp in later europe was mainly cultivated for its fibers  and was used for ropes on many ships  including those of   the use of hemp as a cloth was centered largely in the countryside  with higher quality
being available in the towns 
from   512 ad 
the spaniards brought hemp to the western hemisphere and cultivated it in
starting about 1545  however  in may 1607   hempe  was among the crops gabriel archer observed being cultivated by the natives at the main
village  where
is now situated  and in 1613 
reported wild hemp  better than that in england  growing along the shores of the upper   as early as 1619  the first virginia
passed an act requiring all planters in virginia to sow  both english and indian  hemp on their plantations  the
are first known to have cultivated hemp in
in 1645 
united states  marihuana  production permit  in the united states  hemp cultivation is   but during
farmers were encouraged to grow hemp for cordage  to replace
previously obtained from -controlled areas  the u s  government produced a film explaining the uses of hemp  called  
george washington pushed for the growth of hemp and even grew hemp himself  as it was a
commonly used to make rope and fabric  in may 1765 he noted in his diary about the sowing of seeds each day until mid-april  then he recounts the harvest in october which he grew 27 bushels that year 
there is some speculation that
smoked the flower of the cannabis plant in order to achieve a recreational high   like all farmers  washington probably sampled the quality and potency of what he grew  and he may have used this hemp to treat his chronic tooth aches    but there is no evidence in any of his writings that he grew hemp for anything other than industrial purposes  it is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from washington s diary  which reads  began to seperate  sic  the male from the female hemp at do  rather too late  is evidence that he was trying to grow female plants for the
found in the flowers  however  the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that  this may arise from their  the male  being coarser  and the stalks larger  in subsequent days  he describes soaking the hemp  to make the fibers usable  and harvesting the seeds  suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes  not recreational 
george washington also imported the indian hemp plant from asia  which was used for fiber and  by some growers  for intoxicating resin production  in a letter to william pearce who managed the plants for him washington says   what was done with the indian hemp plant from last summer  it ought  all of it  to be sown again  that not only a stock of seed sufficient for my own purposes might have been raised  but to have disseminated seed to others  as it is more valuable than common hemp    
additional presidents known to have farmed hemp include           and  
historically  hemp production had made up a significant portion of
kentucky s economy  before the   many slaves worked on
producing hemp 
in 1937  the
was passed in the united states  levying a tax on anyone who dealt commercially in cannabis  hemp  or marijuana  the passing of the act to destroy the us hemp industry has been disputed to involve businessmen  
and the  
one claim is that hearst believed     that his extensive timber holdings were threatened by the invention of the
which he feared would allow hemp to become a cheap substitute for the
used for newspaper  historical research indicates this fear was unfounded because improvements of the
in the 1930s  machines that separated the fibers from the hemp stem  could not make hemp fiber a cheaper substitute for fibers from other sources  further  decorticators did not perform satisfactorily in commercial production 
another claim is that mellon 
and the wealthiest man in america at that time  had invested heavily in  s new synthetic fiber    and believed     that the replacement of the traditional resource  hemp  was integral to the new product s success  the company dupont and many industrial historians dispute a link between
and hemp  nylon became immediately a scarce commodity    nylon had characteristics that could be used for
 sold from 1938  and very thin nylon fiber could compete with
and
in various textiles normally not produced from hemp fiber  such as very thin stockings for women 
hemp for victory  a short documentary produced by the
during
hemp was used extensively by the united states during world war ii to make uniforms  canvas  and rope  much of the hemp used was cultivated in
and the   during world war ii  the u s  produced a short 1942 film    promoting hemp as a necessary crop to win the war 
historical cultivation  
hemp has been grown for millennia in asia and the middle east for its fibre  commercial production of hemp in the west took off in the eighteenth century  but was grown in the sixteenth century in eastern england  because of colonial and naval expansion of the era  economies needed large quantities of hemp for rope and   in the early 1940s  world production of hemp fiber ranged from 250 000 to 350 000 metric tonnes 
was the biggest producer 
in western europe  the cultivation of hemp was not legally banned by the 1930s  but the commercial cultivation stopped by then  due to decreased demand compared to increasingly popular artificial fibers  speculation about the potential for commercial cultivation of hemp in large quantities has been criticized due to successful competition from other fibers for many products  the world production of hemp fiber fell from over 300,000 metric tons 1961 to about 75,000 metric tons in the early 1990s and has after that been stable at that level 
japan  
japanese
with rope made of hemp
in   hemp was historically used as paper and a fiber crop  there is archaeological evidence cannabis was used for clothing and the seeds were eaten in japan back to the
 10,000 to 300 bce   many
designs portray hemp  or asa       as a beautiful plant  in 1948  marijuana was restricted as a narcotic drug  the ban on marijuana imposed by the united states authorities was alien to japanese culture  as the drug had never been widely used in japan before  though these laws against marijuana are some of the world s strictest  allowing five years imprisonment for possession of the drug  they exempt hemp growers  whose crop is used to make robes for
and
for   because marijuana use in japan has doubled in the past decade  these exemptions have recently been called into question 
portugal  
the cultivation of hemp in portuguese lands began around the fourteenth century onwards  it was raw material for the preparation of rope and plugs for the portuguese ships  colonies for factories for the production of flax hemp  such as the royal flax hemp factory in brazil 
after the restoration of independence in 1640  in order to recover the ailing portuguese naval fleet  were encouraged its cultivation as the royal decree of d  john iv in 1656  at that time its cultivation was carried out in trs-os-montes  zone tower moncorvo  more precisely in vilaria valley  fertile land for any crop irrigation  and a very large area  flat and very fertile culture still wide until the last century grew up tobacco  a plant that needs a large space to expand and grow  the area lies in the valley of serra de bornes 
in 1971  the cultivation of hemp became illegal  and the production was substantially reduced  because of eu regulations 1308/70  619/71 and 1164/89  this law was revoked  for some certified seed varieties
