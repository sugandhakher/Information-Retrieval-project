seawater  or salt water  is water from a sea or ocean  on average  seawater in the world s oceans has a
of about 3.5   35g l  or 0.600 m  this means that every kilogram  roughly one litre by volume  of seawater has approximately 35 grams  1.2oz  of
 predominantly
 na   and
 cl     average density at the surface is 1.025kg l  seawater is
than both
and pure water  density 1.0kg l at 4c  39f   because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume  the
of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases  at typical salinity  it freezes at about 2c  28f   the coldest seawater ever recorded  in a liquid state  was in 2010  in a stream under an
  and measured 2.6c  27.3f   seawater
is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4  however  there is no universally accepted reference ph-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units

examples of water salinity  values in parts per thousand 
although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 3.1  and 3.8   seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world  where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths or near melting glaciers  seawater can be substantially less saline  the most saline open sea is the   where high rates of   low
and river inflow  and confined circulation result in unusually salty water  the salinity in isolated bodies of water  for example  the   can be considerably greater still 
the
of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029kg m3  depending on the temperature and salinity  deep in the ocean  under high pressure  seawater can reach a density of 1050kg m3 or higher  seawater

seawater contains more dissolved
than all types of freshwater  however  the ratios of solutes differ dramatically  for instance  although seawater contains about 2.8 times more
than river water based on   the
of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved
is far lower than in river water  bicarbonate ions also constitute 48  of river water solutes but only 0.14  of all seawater ions  differences like these are due to the varying
of seawater solutes 
and
have very long residence times  while
 vital for
formation  tends to precipitate much more quickly  the most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium  chloride   
and calcium  its
is about 1000 mosm l 
small amounts of other substances are found including
at concentrations up to 2 micrograms of nitrogen atoms per liter  which are thought to have played a key role in the  
microbial components  
research in 1957 by the
sampled water in both
and
locations in the pacific ocean  direct microscopic counts and cultures were used  the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures  these differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates  selective effects of the culture media  and the presence of inactive cells  a marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the   but not by direct microscopic observation  large numbers of -like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation  the disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields  in the 1990s  improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of   enabled researchers taking part in the
to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers  this revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected  so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20,000 species  dr  mitchell sogin from the
feels that  the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million  
bacteria are found at all depths in the   as well as in the sediments  some being aerobic  others anaerobic  most are free-swimming  but some exist as
within other organisms  examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria 
played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes  enabling the development of
and oxygen in the atmosphere 
some bacteria interact with   and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean  one anaerobic species    plays an important part in the breakdown of
eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the namibian coast  and generated by high rates of phytoplankton growth in the
upwelling zone  eventually falling to the seafloor 
bacteria-like
surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments  such as the
on the ocean floor  alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as
and
spp  survive in a
range of 7.3 to 10.6  while some species will grow only at ph 10 to 10.6  archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean s   clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes  in 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of archaea that breaks down   an important
gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming  some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor  influencing seawater chemistry  oil spills  and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity  as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life  the protist
may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or   often after human-caused pollution  the process may produce
known as biotoxins  which move along the ocean food chain  tainting higher-order animal consumers 
  a species of very large virus  with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species  was discovered in 2013  like the other very large viruses
and   pandoravirus infects amoebas  but its genome  containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of dna  is twice as large as that of megavirus  and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure 
in 2013 researchers from
announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that have evolved in deep sea trenches  hoping to find  the next generation  of antibiotics  anticipating an  antibiotic apocalypse  with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs  the eu-funded research will start in the
and then move on to search trenches off new zealand and antarctica 
the ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material  while this may be true on a small scale  the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems  and rendered them life-threatening  pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters  such as  
the cause of    
and   along with protozoans causing
and   these pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels  and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged

behind the origins of sea salt started with sir
in 1715  who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground  upon reaching the ocean  these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time  see    halley noted that most lakes that don t have ocean outlets  such as the
and the   see    have high salt content  halley termed this process  continental weathering  
halley s theory was partly correct  in addition  sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed  the presence of salt s other dominant ion  chloride  results from
of chloride  as   with other gases from earth s interior via
and   the sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt 
ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years  most likely as a consequence of a chemical  system which removes as much salt as is deposited  for instance  sodium and chloride sinks include
deposits  pure water burial  and reactions with seafloor   133
human impacts  
  rising atmospheric   excess nutrients  and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry  rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record  major trends include an increasing   reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters  rising coastal nitrogen levels  and widespread increases in
and persistent organic pollutants  most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion  fertilizer  and industrial activity  concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades  with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources

accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful  especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water  however  drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive  more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt  via   than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself 
the
actively regulates sodium chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 g l  0.9  by weight  
in most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 3.5   far higher than the body can tolerate and most beyond what the kidney can process  a point frequently overlooked    in claims that the kidney can excrete nacl in baltic concentrations  2    is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations  so that there is no benefit in drinking such water  drinking seawater temporarily increases blood s nacl concentration  this signals the
to excrete sodium  but seawater s sodium concentration is above the kidney s maximum concentrating ability  eventually the blood s sodium concentration rises to toxic levels  removing water from cells and interfering with
conduction  ultimately producing fatal
and    
consistently advise against drinking seawater  a summary of 163
voyages estimated the risk of death at 39  for those who drank seawater  compared to 3  for those who did not  the effect of seawater intake on rats confirmed the negative effects of drinking seawater when dehydrated 
the temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water  and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking  this frustration was described famously by a line from  s  
 water  water  everywhere 
and all the boards did shrink 
water  water  everywhere 
nor any drop to drink  
although humans cannot survive on seawater  some people claim that up to two cups a day  mixed with fresh water in a 2 3 ratio  produces no ill effect  the french physician
survived an ocean crossing in a small zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat  which contains about 40 percent water  like most living tissues   as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean  his findings were challenged  but an alternative explanation was not given  in his 1948 book   
reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 2 3 ratio during the 1947 expedition  a few years later  another adventurer    claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply

advocated the practice s medical use in the uk  and
expanded the advocation of the practice other countries  notably france  in the 20th century  currently  the practice is widely used in nicaragua and other countries  supposedly taking advantage of the latest medical discoveries
