engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the wedge  lever  wheel  and pulley  each of these inventions is essentially consistent with the modern definition of engineering 
the term engineering is derived from the word engineer  which itself dates back to 1390  when an engine er  literally  one who operates an engine  originally referred to  a constructor of military engines   in this context  now obsolete  an  engine  referred to a military machine  i e   a mechanical contraption used in war  for example  a    notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps  e g   the  
the word  engine  itself is of even older origin  ultimately deriving from the
ingenium  c  1250   meaning  innate quality  especially mental power  hence a clever invention  
later  as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline  the term
entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline of

the design of a modern auditorium involves many branches of engineering  including  
and  
engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines  these disciplines concern themselves with differing areas of engineering work  although initially an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline  throughout an engineer s career the engineer may become multi-disciplined  having worked in several of the outlined areas  engineering is often characterized as having four main branches 
 the application of physics  chemistry  biology  and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale  such as       and  
 the design and construction of public and private works  such as
       water supply and treatment etc      dams  and buildings 
 the design  study and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems  such as         devices         
systems    instrumentation  controls  and  
 the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems  such as power and
systems    products   
products          vacuum technology 
equipment    and  
beyond these four  a number of other branches are recognized  historically 
and
were major branches  other engineering fields sometimes included as major branches   are                                         and
engineering  these and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the uk  
new specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches  for example
involves a wide range of subject areas including      
and   a new or emerging area of application will commonly be defined temporarily as a permutation or subset of existing disciplines  there is often gray area as to when a given sub-field warrants classification as a new  branch   one key indicator of such emergence is when major universities start establishing departments and programs in the new field 
for each of these fields there exists considerable overlap  especially in the areas of the application of fundamental sciences to their disciplines such as physics  chemistry  and mathematics  as a result  there are many different types of engineering degrees available  in the past  engineering could be divided into four major branches  mechanical  chemical  civil and electrical  with sub branches of each discipline  today however  the number of engineering degrees available have increased dramatically 
practice  
one who practices engineering is called an   and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as           or   in the uk many trades are called  engineer  including gas  telephone  photocopy  maintenance  plumber-heating  drainage  sanitary  auto mechanic  tv  refrigerator  electrician  washing machine  tv antenna installer  satellite  and many others

design of a
requires collaboration of engineers from many fields  as the system involves mechanical  electro-magnetic and chemical processes  the  
as well as the
all need to be carefully designed and optimized 
engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find suitable solutions to problems or to make improvements to the status quo  more than ever  engineers are now required to have knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects  as a result  they keep on learning new material throughout their career 
if multiple options exist  engineers weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements  the crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify  understand  and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result  it is usually not enough to build a technically successful product  it must also meet further requirements 
constraints may include available resources  physical  imaginative or technical limitations  flexibility for future modifications and additions  and other factors  such as requirements for cost    marketability  productivity  and   by understanding the constraints  engineers derive
for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated 
a general methodology and epistemology of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by walter vincenti  though vincenti s case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering  his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering  too 
according to billy vaughn koen  the  engineering method is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources   koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what he produces  but rather how he goes about it

a drawing for a booster engine for   engineering is applied to   with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science 
engineers use their knowledge of         and
or
to find suitable solutions to a problem  creating an appropriate
of a problem allows them to analyze it  sometimes definitively   and to test potential solutions 
usually multiple reasonable solutions exist  so engineers must evaluate the different
on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements    after gathering statistics on a large number of   suggested that
are at the heart of    engineering designs  while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem 
engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production  they use  among other things            and   testing ensures that products will perform as expected 
engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large  engineers typically include a
in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure  however  the greater the safety factor  the less efficient the design may be

one of the most widely used
in the profession is
 cad  software like     dss

 dmu  and
software such as
or
allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes 
these allow products and components to be checked for flaws  assess fit and assembly  study ergonomics  and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses  temperatures  electromagnetic emissions  electrical currents and voltages  digital logic levels  fluid flows  and kinematics  access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of
software 
there are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as

engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained  compared with the number retiring  this problem is very prominent in the uk where engineering has a poor image and low status  there are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause  as well as ethical issues it is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an  image crisis   rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career  much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the uk and other western economies 
relationships with other disciplines  
science  
scientists study the world as it is  engineers create the world that has never been 

engineers  scientists and technicians works on target positioner inside
 nif  target chamber 
there exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice  in engineering  one applies science  both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena  both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations   
scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks  such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes  conversely  in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena  thus becoming  for the moment  scientists or more precisely  engineering scientists    
in the book   walter vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research  first  it often deals with areas in which the basic
or
are well understood  but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner 
of
works on the capillary flow experiment aboard the  
examples are the use of numerical approximations to the
to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft  or the use of
to calculate fatigue damage  second  engineering research employs many semi- that are foreign to pure scientific research  one example being the method of parameter variation   
as stated by fung et al  in the revision to the classic engineering text foundations of solid mechanics 
engineering is quite different from science  scientists try to understand nature  engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature  engineers stress innovation and invention  to embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms  and design something that people can use  that something can be a complex system  device  a gadget  a material  a method  a computing program  an innovative experiment  a new solution to a problem  or an improvement on what already exists  since a design has to be realistic and functional  it must have its geometry  dimensions  and characteristics data defined  in the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions  most often  they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge  thus they studied mathematics  physics  chemistry  biology and mechanics  often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession  thus engineering sciences were born 
although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles  engineers must also take into account safety  efficiency  economy  reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment  ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution

modern medicine can replace several of the body s functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as  for example 
and   the fields of
and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems 
conversely  some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying  and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing
with technology  this has led to fields such as       and   there are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine 
both fields provide solutions to real world problems  this often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and
knowledge is an integral part of both 
medicine  in part  studies the function of the human body  the human body  as a biological machine  has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods 
the heart for example functions much like a pump  the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers  the brain produces
etc  these similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine  led to the development of the field of
that uses concepts developed in both disciplines 
newly emerging branches of science  such as   are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering  such as systems modeling and computational analysis  to the description of biological systems 
art  
there are connections between engineering and art  they are direct in some fields  for example   
and

is a specialized field of management concerned with the engineering sector  the demand for management-focused engineers  or from the opposite perspective  managers with an understanding of engineering   has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles  during an engineering management course  students will develop
skills  knowledge and expertise  alongside knowledge of business administration  management techniques  and strategic thinking  engineers specializing in change management must have in depth knowledge of the application of
