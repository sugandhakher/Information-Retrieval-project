there has been debate on the role that increased international trade has played in increasing pollution  while some maintain that increases in pollution which result in both local
and a global
are intimately linked to increases in international trade  others have argued that as citizens become more affluent they ll also advocate for cleaner environments  according to a
paper 
 since freer trade raises income  it directly contributes to increasing pollution levels via the scale effect  however  it thereby induces the composition  and  technique effects of increased income  both of which tend to reduce pollution levels  
early tariff implementation proposal  
although the
has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on implementing tough new anti-pollution measures  it was the originator of a legislative proposal suggesting an environmental tariff be applied against exporting countries whose exports gained significant cost advantages due to less stringent environmental regulations  the proposed legislation was tabled as the international pollution deterrence act of 1991 and was introduced in its senate in april of that year 
proposed international pollution control index  
a notable feature of the proposed u s  international pollution deterrence act was the international pollution control index it cited within its section 5  which read 
international pollution control index
section 8002 of the solid waste disposal act  42 u s c  6982  is amended by adding the following new subsections at the end thereof 
  t  the administrator shall prepare  within one hundred and twenty days of the enactment of this section and yearly thereafter  a pollution control index for each of the top fifty countries identified by the office of trade and investment of the department of commerce based on the value of exports to the united states from that country s attainment of pollution control standards in the areas of air  water  hazardous waste and solid waste as compared to the united states  the purpose of this index is to measure the level of compliance within each country with standards comparable to or greater than those in the united states  the administrator shall analyze  in particular  the level of technology employed and actual costs incurred for pollution control in the major export sectors of each country in formulating the index 
agitation against use of environmental tariffs  
environment tariffs were not implemented in the past  in part  because they were not sanctioned by multilateral trade regimes such as the
and within the
 gatt   a fact which generated considerable criticism and calls for reform 
additionally  many foreign factory owners in
and underdeveloped countries saw the attempts to impose pollution controls on them as suspicious   
    seeing it as a threat to their growth and fearing that developed countries would attempt to export their preferences for pollution control or to place  environmental  tariffs on imports from countries with lower standards
