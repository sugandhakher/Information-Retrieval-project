and
is believed to be the first federation to have introduced a formal system of
 hfe  which was introduced in 1933 to compensate
which have a lower capacity to raise revenue  many federations use fiscal equalisation to reduce the inequalities in the fiscal capacities of sub-national governments arising from the differences in their geography  demography  natural endowments and economies  however the level of equalisation sought varies  in australia  the objective is full equalisation 
full equalisation means that  after hfe  each of the six states  the australian capital territory and the northern territory would have the capacity to provide services and the associated infrastructure at the same standard  if each state or territory made the same effort to raise revenue from its own sources and operated at the same level of efficiency 
currently the funds distributed to achieve hfe are the revenues raised from the
 gst   currently about aud50bn a year  the distribution of gst required to achieve hfe is decided by the federal treasurer each year  on the basis of advice provided by the
 cgc  
achieving hfe does not mean that the states and territories are directed how to raise revenue or how to spend their funds  gst revenue grants from the commonwealth are unencumbered and available for any purpose  accordingly  hfe equalises fiscal capacity  not fiscal policies which remain for the states and territories to decide for themselves  it does not result in the same level of services or taxes in all states and territories  direct that the states and territories must achieve any specified level of service in any area  nor impose actual budget outcomes in accordance with the commission s calculations 
at its meeting on 13 december 2013  coag agreed to streamline the coag council system and refocus on coag s priorities over the next 12 to 18 months
