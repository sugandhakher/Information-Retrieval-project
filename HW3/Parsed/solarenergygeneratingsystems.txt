solar energy generating systems  segs  in   with the combined capacity from three separate locations at 354
 mw  474,700hp   is now the world s
generating facility  after the commissioning of the even larger
in 2014  it consists of nine
in california s   where
is among the best available in the united states  segs iii  44mw  are located at
    segsiiivii  150mw  are installed at
    and segs viiiix  160mw  are placed at
   
operates and partially owns the plants located at kramer junction and harper lake  a tenth plant  segs x  80mw  had been in construction and segs xi and segs xii had been planned by   but the developer filed for bankruptcy in 1992  because it was unable to secure construction financing

plants  scale and operations  
the plants have a 354 mw net  394 mw gross  installed capacity  the nameplate capacity  which operating continuously  would dliver the sam net power output  coming only from the solar source is around 75
  representing a 21    in addition  the turbines can be utilized at night by burning  
nextera claims that the solar plants power 232,500 homs  during the day  at peak power  and displace 3,800tons of pollution pr year that would have been produced if the electricity had bn providd by fossil fuels  such as oil 
the facilities have a total of 936,384 mirrors and cover more than 1,600 acres  647.5ha   lined up  the parabolic mirrors would extend over 229 miles  369km  
as an example of cost  in 2002  one of the 30 mw kramer junction sites required  90 million to construct  and its operation and maintenance cost was about  3 million per year  4.6 cents per kilowatt hour   with a considered lifetime of 20 years  the operation  maintenance and investments interest and depreciation triples the price  to approximately 14 cents per kilowatt hour   
principle of operation  
sketch of a parabolic trough collector
the installation uses  
technology along with
to generate   about 90  of the electricity is produced by the     natural gas is only used when the solar power is insufficient to meet the demand from   the distributor of power in southern california 
mirrors  
the parabolic mirrors are shaped like quarter-pipes  the sun shines onto the panels made of glass  which are 94 reflective  unlike a typical mirror  which is only 70 reflective  the mirrors automatically track the sun throughout the day  the greatest source of mirror breakage is wind  with 3,000 mirrors typically replaced each year  operators can turn the mirrors to protect them during intense wind storms  an automated washing mechanism is used to periodically clean the parabolic reflective panels 
heat transfer  
the sunlight bounces off the mirrors and is directed to a central tube filled with   which heats to over 400c  750f   the reflected light focused at the central tube is 71 to 80times more intense than the ordinary sunlight  the synthetic oil transfers its heat to water  which boils and drives the
steam turbine  thereby generating electricity  synthetic oil is used to carry the heat  instead of water  to keep the pressure within manageable parameters 
individual locations  
the segs power plants were built by   and commissioned between december 20  1984 and october 1  1990  after luz industries 
in 1991 plants were sold to various investor groups as individual projects  and expansion including three more plants was halted 
kramer junction employs about 95people and 45people work at harper lake

segs viii and segs ix  located at   until
commissioning in 2014  were the largest solar thermal power plants individually and collectively in the world  they were the last  the largest  and the most advanced of the nine plants at segs  designed to take advantage of the economies of scale  construction of the tenth plant in the same locality was halted because of the bankruptcy of luz industries  construction of the approved eleventh and twelfth plants never started  each of the three planned plants had 80 mw of installed capacity 
recently constructed the 280mw
 msp  adjacent to the segs viii and segs ix plants  the msp also uses concentrating solar thermal trough technology 
kramer junction  
the reflectors at kramer junction site facing the western sky to focus the late afternoon sunlight at the absorber tubes partially seen in the picture as bright white spots 
this location    receives an average of 340days of sunshine per year  which makes it an ideal place for solar power generation  the average
 dnr  is 7.44 m day  310w m   one of the best in the nation

accidents and incidents  
in february 1999  a 900,000-us-gallon  3,400m3 
storage tank exploded at the segs i  daggett  solar power plant  sending flames and smoke into the sky  authorities were trying to keep flames away from two adjacent containers that held
