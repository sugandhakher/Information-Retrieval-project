the international electrotechnical commission  iec  in   commission lectrotechnique internationale  cei   is a  
international
that prepares and publishes international standards for all  
and related technologies  collectively known as     iec standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation  transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment  semiconductors  fibre optics  batteries   
and marine energy as well as many others  the iec also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment  system or components conform to its international standards 
the iec charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution  electronics  magnetics and      
and   as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols  electromagnetic compatibility  by its advisory committee on   acec   measurement and performance  dependability  design and development  safety and the environment

history  
the iec held its inaugural meeting on 26 june 1906  following discussions between the british   the   and others  which began at the 1900   and continued with
playing a key role 
the iec was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement  particularly     and     it also first proposed a system of standards  the   which ultimately became the   or systme international dunits  in english  the international system of units  
in 1938  it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical  electronic and related technologies  this effort continues  and the
 the on-line version of which is known as the electropedia  remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries 
the
    in english  the international special committee on radio interference  is one of the groups founded by the iec 
currently  82 countries are members while another 82 participate in the affiliate country programme  which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the iec  originally located in   the commission moved to its current headquarters in
in 1948  it has regional centres in asia-pacific     latin america    brazil  and north america    united states  
today  the iec is the world s leading international organization in its field  and its standards are adopted as national standards by its members  the work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry  government  academia  test labs and others with an interest in the subject

iec standards have numbers in the range 6000079999 and their titles take a form such as iec 60417  graphical symbols for use on equipment  the numbers of older iec standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000  for example iec 27 became iec 60027 
the iec cooperates closely with the
and the   in addition  it works with several major standards development organizations  including the
with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002  which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work 
standards developed jointly with iso such as iso iec 26300  open document format for office applications  opendocument  v1.0 carry the acronym of both organizations  the use of the iso iec prefix covers publications from   as well as conformity assessment standards developed by iso casco and iec cab  conformity assessment board   other standards developed in cooperation between iec and iso are assigned numbers in the 80000 series  such as iec 82045-1 
the 60000 series of standards are also found preceded by en to indicate the iec standards harmonized as european standards  for example iec 60034 would be en 60034 
iec standards are also being adopted as harmonized standards by other certifying bodies such as
 united kingdom  
 canada  
     united states  
 south africa  
 australia      china  and
 germany   iec standards harmonized by other certifying bodies generally have some noted differences from the original iec standard

the iec is made up of members  called national committees  and each nc represents its nation s electrotechnical interests in the iec  this includes manufacturers  providers  distributors and vendors  consumers and users  all levels of governmental agencies  professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies  national committees are constituted in different ways  some ncs are public sector only  some are a combination of public and private sector  and some are private sector only  about 90  of those who prepare iec standards work in industry
