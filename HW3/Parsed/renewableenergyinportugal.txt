renewable energy in portugal was the source for 25.7  of energy consumption in 2013 
in 2014  63  of portugal s electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources 
in 2015  50.4  of power produced in portugal came from renewable sources  the decrease from the year before was caused by lower productivity in the hydroelectric sector because of a dry year 
in 2001  the portuguese government launched a new
instrument  the e4 programme  energy efficiency and endogenous energies   consisting of a set of multiple  diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent  integrated approach to energy supply and demand  by promoting
and the use of
 endogenous  sources  the programme sought to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the countrys social fabric  while preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions  especially the  
while from 2002-2007 the main priorities were focused on the introduction of
 aiming at progressively replacing oil and coal in the energy balance  and liberalization of the
 by opening this former state-owned sector to competition and private investment   the emphasis shifted for the next 5 years was on energy efficiency  supply and demand sides  and use of endogenous  renewable  energy 
during february 2016  an equivalent to 95  of electricity consumed in portugal was produced by renewable sources such as biomass  hydropower  wind power and solar power  a total of 4139 gwh was produced by these sources  in may 2016  all of portugal s electricity was produced renewably for a period of over four days  a landmark achievement for a modern european country

hydro power  
alto lindoso dam  serving the largest hydroelectric power station in the country
the largest hydroelectric power station is at the alto lindoso dam  with a capacity of 630 mw  portugal has about 100
systems  with a capacity of 256 mw  which produce 815 gwh year 
wind power  
main article 
from march 2007 to december 2010 
nameplate capacity grew from 1,874 to 3,937 mw in  excluding madeira and azores  portugal  the major
manufacturers in the portuguese market are  
and  
the 240 mw
in the
district became fully operational in november  2008  at the time of completion it was europe s largest on-shore wind farm 
other major
which are operating  or under construction  include 
 112 mw  
 106 mw  
 144 mw  and
 240 mw  
portugal combines wind and hydropower by using nighttime winds to pump water uphill and sending the water back through generators to produce power the next day  the so-called  
solar power  
serpa solar power plant
main article 
a large
power project  the   was completed in portugal  one of europe s sunniest areas  the 11 megawatt plant covered 150 acres  0.61km2  and employs 52,000 pv panels  the panels are raised 2 metres off the ground allowing grazing to continue  the plant provides enough energy for 8,000 homes and saves an estimated 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year 
not far from there 
is under construction  with more than 376,000 solar modules  it will have an installed capacity of 62mwp when finished  the first stage of construction is scheduled for completion in 2008  a solar panel factory is also being built in the city of   where there are plans to build a research lab   
geothermal power  
main article 
 s main investment for the use of this type of energy is in the   small scale use of this energy source began in the 1980s in
and  
providing 3 mwt 
in the
the use of
is widespread  with production in 8 of the 9 islands  collectively producing some 235.5 mwt  in 2003  25  of the electricity consumed in
was produced by geothermal energy 
wave power  
1 of 3 pelamis machines at the aguadoura wave park
was the world s first commercial
when it opened on 23 september 2008  it was located three miles  5km  offshore near
north of porto  the farm used three
wave energy converters to convert the motion of the
into electricity  the wave farm was shut down in november 2008  just over two months after the official opening 
biogas  
in 2011  portugal produced 45
 kiloton of oil equivalent  of biogas
