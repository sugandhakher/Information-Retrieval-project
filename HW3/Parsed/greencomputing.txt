green computing  green ict as per ifg international federation of green ict and ifg standard  green it  or ict sustainability  is the study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing or it  san murugesan notes that this can include  designing  manufacturing  using  and
of computers  servers  and associated subsystemssuch as monitors  printers  storage devices  and networking and communications systems  efficiently and effectively with minimal or no effect on the environment  
the goals of green computing are similar to   reduce the use of hazardous materials  maximize
during the product s lifetime  and promote the
or
of defunct products and factory waste  green computing is important for all classes of systems  ranging from handheld systems to large-scale data centers 
many corporate it departments have green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their it operations

origins  
energy star logo
in 1992  the
launched   a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize energy-efficiency in monitors  climate control equipment  and other technologies  this resulted in the widespread adoption of
among consumer electronics  concurrently  the swedish organization tco development launched the
program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from -based   this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption    and the use of hazardous materials in construction 
regulations and industry initiatives  
the
 oecd  has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on  green icts   i e  information and communication technologies  the environment and climate change  the report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening icts themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation  in general  only 20  of initiatives have measurable targets  with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations 
government  
many
agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing  the
program was revised in october 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment  along with a tiered ranking system for approved products 
by 2008  26 us states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment  the statutes either impose an  advance recovery fee  for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal 
in 2010  the
 arra  was signed into legislation by president obama  the bill allocated over  90 billion to be invested in green initiatives  renewable energy  smart grids  energy efficiency  etc   in january 2010  the u s  energy department granted  47 million of the arra money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers  the projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software  improve power supply chain  and  
industry  
 csci  is an effort to reduce the electric power consumption of pcs in active and inactive states  the csci provides a catalog of green products from its member organizations  and information for reducing pc power consumption  it was started on 2007-06-12  the name stems from the  s climate savers program  which was launched in 1999  the wwf is also a member of the computing initiative 
the
offers the
 epeat  to assist in the purchase of  greener  computing systems  the council evaluates computing equipment on 51 criteria - 23 required and 28 optional - that measure a product s efficiency and sustainability attributes  products are rated gold  silver  or bronze  depending on how many optional criteria they meet  on 2007-01-24  president
issued executive order 13423  which requires all united states federal agencies to use epeat when purchasing computer systems 
is a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems  it was founded in february 2007 by several key companies in the industry                
 purchased in 2010 by   
and   the green grid has since grown to hundreds of members  including end-users and government organizations  all focused on improving
 dcie  
the
list rates supercomputers by energy efficiency      encouraging a focus on efficiency rather than absolute performance 
is an organization that promotes the development of energy conservation technology and practices in the field of information and communications technology  ict  
the
 tpc  energy specification augments existing tpc benchmarks by allowing optional publications of energy metrics alongside performance results 
is the first industry standard benchmark that measures power consumption in relation to performance of satveer for server-class computers  other benchmarks which measure energy efficiency include     and  
approaches  
in a 2008 article san murugesan defined green computing as  the study and practice of designing  manufacturing  using  and disposing of computers  servers  and associated subsystems  such as monitors  printers  storage devices  and networking and communications systems  efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment   murugesan lays out four paths along which he believes the environmental effects of computing should be addressed  green use  green disposal  green design  and green manufacturing  green computing can also develop solutions that offer benefits by  aligning all it processes and practices with the core principles of sustainability  which are to reduce  reuse  and recycle  and finding innovative ways to use it in business processes to deliver sustainability benefits across the enterprise and beyond  
modern
systems rely upon a complicated mix of people  networks  and hardware  as such  a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well  a solution may also need to address end user satisfaction  management restructuring  regulatory compliance  and return on investment  roi   there are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption   of the power management tools available  one of the most powerful may still be simple  plain  common sense  
product longevity  
maintains that the pc manufacturing process accounts for 70  of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a pc  more recently  fujitsu released a life cycle assessment  lca  of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop s ecological footprint  therefore  the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment s lifetime  another report from gartner recommends to  look for product longevity  including upgradability and modularity  
for instance  manufacturing a new pc makes a far bigger
than manufacturing a new
module to upgrade an existing one 
data center design  
data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy  accounting for between 1.1  and 1.5  of the worlds total energy use in 2010  1   the u s  department of energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings 
energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center  from the it equipment to the hvac equipment to the actual location  configuration and construction of the building 
the u s  department of energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices 
information technology  it  systems
environmental conditions
air management
cooling systems
electrical systems
additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the u s  department of energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat 
energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data centers space  and increase performance and efficiency 
software and deployment optimization  
algorithmic efficiency  
main article 
further information 
the efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs  algorithm changes  such as switching from a slow  e g  linear  search algorithm to a fast  e g  hashed or indexed  search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero  in 2009  a study by a physicist at
estimated that the average google search released 7grams of carbon dioxide  co   however  google disputed this figure  arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2grams of co 
resource allocation  
main article 
algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive  researchers from mit  carnegie mellon university  and akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs  the researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed  however  this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used  it reduces only the cost to the company using it  nonetheless  a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way  a similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather  this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning 
larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available  local availability of renewable energy  climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling  or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions 
approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper network device management techniques are surveyed in  the authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies  namely  i  adaptive link rate  alr    ii  interface proxying   iii  energy aware infrastructure  and  iv  energy aware applications 
virtualizing  
main article 
see also 
computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources  such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware  the concept originated with the ibm
operating systems of the 1960s  but was commercialized for -compatible computers only in the 1990s  with virtualization  a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single  powerful system  thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption  virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state  several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing 
and
have also built proprietary
to the x86
into each of their cpu product lines  in order to facilitate virtual computing 
terminal servers  
main article 
terminal servers have also been used in green computing  when using the system  users at a terminal connect to a central server  all of the actual computing is done on the server  but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal  these can be combined with   which use up to 1/8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation  resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption    there has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs  examples of terminal server software include
for windows and the
 ltsp  for the  
power management  
main article 
the
 acpi   an open industry standard  allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware  this allows a system to automatically turn off components such as
and
after set periods of inactivity  in addition  a system may   when most components  including the
and the system ram  are turned off  acpi is a successor to an earlier intel-microsoft standard called   which allows a computer s
to control power management functions   
some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the cpu  which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed  this process is called   some cpus can automatically undervolt the processor  depending on the workload  this technology is called    on intel processors        on amd chips 
on
cpus  and
with
processors 
data center power  
data centers  which have been criticized for their extraordinarily high energy demand  are a primary focus for proponents of green computing  data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization  many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers  which results in lower energy usage  the first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators  the u s  federal government has set a minimum 10  reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011  with the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology  google inc  has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50  of that of the industry average 
operating system support  
microsoft windows  has included limited
features since windows 95  these initially provided for stand-by  suspend-to-ram  and a monitor low power state  further iterations of windows added hibernate  suspend-to-disk  and support for the
standard  windows 2000 was the first nt-based operating system to include power management  this required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model  windows 2000 also introduced   a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most windows features  however  power management was not one of those features  this is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values  effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings 
this approach  which is not compatible with windows group policy  was repeated in windows xp  the reasons for this design decision by microsoft are not known  and it has resulted in heavy criticism  microsoft significantly improved this in windows vista by redesigning the power management system to allow basic configuration by group policy  the support offered is limited to a single per-computer policy  the most recent release  windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for     and display panel brightness  the most significant change in windows 7 is in the user experience  the prominence of the default high performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power 
there is a significant market in third-party
software offering features beyond those present in the windows operating system  available  most products offer
integration and per-user per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans  scheduled power plans  anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting  notable vendors include

certifies psus that are at least 80  efficient  typically these models are drop-in replacements for older  less efficient psus of the same form factor  as of july 20  2007  all new energy star 4.0-certified desktop psus must be at least 80  efficient 
storage  
smaller form factor  e g   2.5inch 
often consume less power per gigabyte than physically larger drives  unlike hard disk drives 
store data in flash memory or   with no moving parts  power consumption may be reduced somewhat for low-capacity flash-based devices 
in a recent case study    manufacturer of solid state storage devices  managed to reduce the energy use and operating costs of
data centers by 80  while increasing performance speeds beyond that which had been attainable via multiple hard disk drives in raid 0  in response  myspace was able to retire several of their servers 
as hard drive prices have fallen  storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online  this includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage  the increase in online storage has increased power consumption  reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays  while still providing the benefits of online storage  is a subject of ongoing research

materials recycling  
main articles      and
recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead  mercury  and hexavalent chromium out of   and can also replace equipment that otherwise would need to be manufactured  saving further energy and emissions  computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed  or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations  however  many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment  additionally  parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets and municipal or private recycling centers  computing supplies  such as     and
may be recycled as well 
a drawback to many of these schemes is that computers gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to
where environmental standards are less strict than in north america and europe  the
estimates that 80  of the post-consumer e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as
and  
in 2011  the collection rate of e-waste is still very low  even in the most ecology-responsible countries like france  in this country  e-waste collection is still at a 14  annual rate between electronic equipment sold and e-waste collected for 2006 to 2009 
the recycling of old computers raises an important privacy issue  the old storage devices still hold private information  such as emails  passwords  and credit card numbers  which can be recovered simply by someone s using software available freely on the internet  deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive  before recycling a computer  users should remove the hard drive  or hard drives if there is more than one  and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe  there are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling  and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement 
cloud computing  
main article 
cloud computing addresses two major ict challenges related to green computing  energy usage and resource consumption      multi-tenancy  green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up to a great extent  large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30  and 90  respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud  one common example includes
that helps people purchase products and services over the internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel to reach out to the physical shop  which  in turn  reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel 
telecommuting  
main article 
and
technologies are often implemented in green computing initiatives  the advantages are many  increased worker satisfaction  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel  and increased profit margins as a result of lower overhead costs for office space  heat  lighting  etc  the savings are significant  the average annual energy consumption for u s  office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot  with heat  air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70  of all energy consumed  other related initiatives  such as   reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it  many types of jobs  such as sales  consulting  and field service  integrate well with this technique 
reduces the telephony wiring infrastructure by sharing the existing ethernet copper  voip and phone extension mobility also made
more practical 
telecommunication network devices energy indices  
the information and communication technologies  icts  energy consumption  in the usa and worldwide  has been estimated respectively at 9.4  and 5.3  of the total electricity produced  the energy consumption of icts is today significant even when compared with other industries  some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices  network elements   this analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself  the target was to allow an immediate perception of the relationship between the network technology and the environmental effect  these studies are at the start and the gap to fill in this sector is still huge and further research will be necessary 
supercomputers  
the inaugural green500 list was announced on november 15  2007 at sc 07  as a complement to the top500  the unveiling of the green500 ushered in a new era where supercomputers can be compared by performance-per-watt 
the
by tokyo institute of technology  made in japan was with a great advantage to the second  the top 1 supercomputer in the world with 4,503.17 mflops w and 27.78 total power  kw   
today a new supercomputer 
from the   made in germany emerged as the most energy-efficient  or greenest  supercomputer in the world  the l-csc cluster was the first and only supercomputer on the list to surpass 5 gigaflops watt  billions of operations per second per watt   l-csc is a heterogeneous supercomputer that is powered by dual intel xeon e5-260 and gpu accelerators  namely amd firepro s9150 gpus  it marks the first time that a supercomputer using amd gpus has held the top spot  each server has a memory of 256 gigabytes  connected  the server via an infiniband fdr network 
education and certification  
green computing programs  
degree and postgraduate programs that provide training in a range of information technology concentrations along with sustainable strategies in an effort to educate students how to build and maintain systems while reducing its harm to the environment  the
 anu  offers  ict sustainability  as part of its information technology and engineering masters programs 
offer a similar course  green ict strategies   adapted from the anu course notes by tom worthington  in the uk 
offers an msc sustainable computing program in both full and part-time access modes 
green computing certifications  
some certifications demonstrate that an individual has specific green computing knowledge  including 
green computing initiative - gci offers the certified green computing user specialist  cgcus   certified green computing architect  cgca  and certified green computing professional  cgcp  certifications 
strata green it is designed for it managers to show that they have good knowledge of green it practices and methods and why it is important to incorporate them into an organization
