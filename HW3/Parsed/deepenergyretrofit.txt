a deep energy retrofit is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses  integrative design  to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional   deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential  commercial  buildings  a deep energy retrofit typically results in savings of 30 percent or more  perhaps spread over several years  and may significantly improve the building value 
the term  deep energy retrofit  is often used interchangeably with  deep green retrofit  and  deep retrofit   a deep green retrofit may have less focus on energy efficiency and may emphasize obtaining certification from a green building rating system  such as   the definition of the term continues to be refined and debated

deep energy v  conventional energy retrofits  
conventional energy retrofits focus on isolated system upgrades  i e  lighting and hvac equipment   these retrofits are generally simple and fast  but they often miss opportunity for saving more energy cost-effectively 
deep energy retrofits achieve much greater energy efficiency by taking a whole-building approach  addressing many systems at once  it is most economical and convenient to take this approach on buildings with overall poor efficiency performance  with multiple systems nearing the end of useful life  and perhaps other reasons 
energy efficiency measures  
a deep energy retrofit combines energy efficiency measures such as energy efficient equipment  air sealing  moisture management  controlled ventilation  insulation  and solar control so that dramatic energy savings are achieved alongside optimal building performance 
durability  good interior air quality and energy efficiency are attained by sound building science practices  in a deep energy retrofit  filling a wall cavity with effective insulation also requires careful consideration of how that wall will dry if moisture does happen to get past its skin  using very high r-value insulation systems on the exterior of the building enclosure is often one of the hallmarks of a deep energy retrofit  where exactly the dewpoint will fall in  or out  of those thickened wallsand in what climate zonebecomes crucial  careful detailing  flashing and air sealing of windows and other building penetrations is also key to a successful deep energy retrofit 
systems thinking is required for these kinds of retrofits  where highly efficient windows are  tuned  to their orientation  and mechanical systems and
units are sized and integrated with how the walls  roof and basement are being air sealed  moisture-managed and insulated 
process  
a level iii   as defined by   is required in order to complete a commercial building deep energy retrofit  also known as an   this type of energy audit features analysis of the interactions between efficiency strategies and their life cycle cost  upon selection and implementation of measures  the energy savings are verified using the international performance measurement and verification protocol 
tools  
deep energy retrofits make use of energy modeling tools that integrate with an organization s pro forma or other financial decision making mechanisms 
technologies have simplified the retrofit process as a number of audit and retrofit tools have appeared over the last 5 years to speed up retrofits and maximize efficiency in the field 
ratings  
a building that has undergone a deep energy retrofit is well positioned for a green building rating such as  
benefits  
there have been a number of studies done to determine and quantify the benefits afforded to owners  tenants  and various other stakeholders from the successful completion of deep energy retrofits 
common owner related benefits include 
reduced costs through energy savings
higher rent premiums
increased occupancy rates
common benefits to tenants include 
increased productivity
reduced employee sick days
notable case studies  
the empire state building  
the
is undergoing a deep energy retrofit process that is projected to be completed in 2013  upon completion  the project team  consisting of representatives from         and nyserda will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38  and  4.4 million 
a notable achievement of the project is that instead of replacing the chillers as originally planned  the design team were able to first reduce the buildings required cooling capacity by 1600 tons  allowing for a chiller retrofit instead of replacement which would have been  17.3 million more in capital costs 
the indianapolis city-county building  
the city-county building recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process that is projected to be completed in september 2011  upon completion  the project team  consisting of representatives from the indianapolis marion county building authority  indianapolis office of sustainability  rocky mountain institute  and performance services will have achieved an annual energy reduction of 46  and  750,000 annual energy savings
