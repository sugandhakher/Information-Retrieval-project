commercial
power stations are usually constructed on a large scale and designed for continuous operation  virtually all electric power plants use
to produce alternating current  ac  electric power at a
of 50hz or 60   large companies or institutions may have their own power plants to supply
or electricity to their facilities  especially if steam is created anyway for other purposes  steam-driven power plants have been used to drive most ships in most of the 20th century until recently  steam power plants are now only used in large nuclear
ships  shipboard power plants usually directly couple the turbine to the ship s propellers through gearboxes  power plants in such ships also provide steam to smaller turbines driving electric generators to supply electricity

history  
the initially developed
has been used to produce mechanical power since the 18th century  with notable improvements being made by   when the first commercially developed central electrical power stations were established in 1882 at
in new york and
in london  reciprocating steam engines were used  the development of the
in 1884 provided larger and more efficient machine designs for central generating stations  by 1892 the turbine was considered a better alternative to reciprocating engines  turbines offered higher speeds  more compact machinery  and stable speed regulation allowing for parallel synchronous operation of generators on a common bus  after about 1905  turbines entirely replaced reciprocating engines in large central power stations 
the largest reciprocating engine-generator sets ever built were completed in 1901 for the manhattan elevated railway  each of seventeen units weighed about 500 tons and was rated 6000 kilowatts  a contemporary turbine set of similar rating would have weighed about 20  as much

the energy efficiency of a conventional thermal power station  considered salable energy produced as a percent of the
of the fuel consumed  is typically 33  to 48     as with all heat engines  their efficiency is limited  and governed by the laws of   by comparison  most
in the united states are about 90 percent efficient in converting the energy of falling water into electricity 
the energy of a thermal not utilized in power production must leave the plant in the form of heat to the environment  this

facilities  these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of
and in these plants  freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products 
the
dictates that higher efficiencies can be attained by increasing the temperature of the steam  sub-critical fossil fuel power plants can achieve 3640  efficiency 
designs have efficiencies in the low to mid 40  range  with new  ultra critical  designs using pressures of 4400 psi  30.3 mpa  and multiple stage reheat reaching about 48  efficiency  above the
for
of 705f  374c  and 3212 psi  22.06 mpa   there is no
from water to steam  but only a gradual decrease in  
currently most of the nuclear power plants must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal-fired plants do  in order to provide more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel rods  this  in turn  limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 3032   some advanced reactor designs being studied  such as the  
and   would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants  producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency

boiler and steam cycle  
in the
field 
refers to a specific type of large
used in a
 pwr  to thermally connect the primary  reactor plant  and secondary  steam plant  systems  which generates steam  in a nuclear reactor called a
 bwr   water is boiled to generate steam directly in the reactor itself and there are no units called steam generators 
in some industrial settings  there can also be steam-producing heat exchangers called
 hrsg  which utilize heat from some industrial process  most commonly utilizing hot exhaust from a gas turbine  the steam generating boiler has to produce steam at the high purity  pressure and temperature required for the steam turbine that drives the electrical generator 
need no boiler since they use naturally occurring steam sources  heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids 
a fossil fuel steam generator includes an   a   and the
with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils  necessary
are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure  the air and
path equipment include  forced draft  fd   
 ap   boiler furnace  induced draft  id  fan  fly ash collectors   or   and the  
feed water heating and deaeration  
the
used in the
boiler is a means of transferring heat energy from the burning fuel to the mechanical energy of the spinning   the total feed water consists of recirculated condensate water and purified makeup water  because the metallic materials it contacts are subject to
at high temperatures and pressures  the makeup water is highly purified before use  a system of
and
demineralizers produces water so pure that it coincidentally becomes an electrical   with
in the range of 0.31.0
per centimeter  the makeup water in a 500mwe plant amounts to perhaps 120 us gallons per minute  7.6 l s  to replace water drawn off from the boiler drums for water purity management  and to also offset the small losses from steam leaks in the system 
the feed water cycle begins with condensate water being pumped out of the
after traveling through the steam turbines  the condensate flow rate at full load in a 500mw plant is about 6,000 us gallons per minute  400 l s  
diagram of boiler feed water deaerator  with vertical  domed aeration section and horizontal water storage section  
the water is pressurized in two stages  and flows through a series of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters  heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage  typically  in the middle of this series of feedwater heaters  and before the second stage of pressurization  the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a
that removes dissolved air from the water  further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness  the water may be dosed following this point with   a chemical that removes the remaining
in the water to below 5
 ppb     it is also dosed with
control agents such as
or
to keep the residual
low and thus non-corrosive 
boiler operation  
the boiler is a rectangular
about 50 feet  15m  on a side and 130 feet  40m  tall  its walls are made of a web of high pressure steel tubes about 2.3 inches  58mm  in diameter 
is air-blown into the furnace through burners located at the four corners  or along one wall  or two opposite walls  and it is ignited to rapidly burn  forming a large fireball at the center  the
of the fireball heats the water that circulates through the boiler tubes near the boiler perimeter  the water circulation rate in the boiler is three to four times the throughput  as the water in the
circulates it absorbs heat and changes into steam  it is separated from the water inside a drum at the top of the furnace  the saturated steam is introduced into
pendant tubes that hang in the hottest part of the combustion gases as they exit the furnace  here the steam is superheated to 1,000f  540c  to prepare it for the turbine 
plants designed for
 brown coal  are increasingly used in locations as varied as  
and   lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal  it has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output  such coals may contain up to 70  water and   yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans  the firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler 
plants that use gas turbines to heat the water for conversion into steam use boilers known as
 hrsg   the exhaust heat from the gas turbines is used to make superheated steam that is then used in a conventional water-steam generation cycle  as described in
section below 
boiler furnace and steam drum  
the water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the   from the economizer it passes to the
and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers at the bottom of the water walls  from these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum  this process may be driven purely by
 because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water steam mixture in the water walls  or assisted by pumps  in the steam drum  the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of
and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam  the dry steam then flows into the superheater coils 
the boiler furnace auxiliary equipment includes
feed nozzles and igniter guns    water lancing and observation ports  in the furnace walls  for observation of the furnace interior  furnace
due to any accumulation of combustible gases after a trip-out are avoided by flushing out such gases from the combustion zone before igniting the coal 
the steam drum  as well as the
coils and headers  have air vents and drains needed for initial start up 
superheater  
fossil fuel power plants often have a
section in the steam generating furnace    the steam passes through drying equipment inside the steam drum on to the superheater  a set of tubes in the furnace  here the steam picks up more energy from hot flue gases outside the tubing and its temperature is now superheated above the saturation temperature  the superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves before the high pressure turbine 
nuclear-powered steam plants do not have such sections but produce steam at essentially saturated conditions  experimental nuclear plants were equipped with fossil-fired super heaters in an attempt to improve overall plant operating cost   
steam condensing  
the condenser condenses the steam from the exhaust of the turbine into liquid to allow it to be pumped  if the condenser can be made cooler  the pressure of the exhaust steam is reduced and efficiency of the
increases 
diagram of a typical water-cooled surface condenser 
the surface condenser is a
in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes  the exhaust steam from the low pressure turbine enters the shell where it is cooled and converted to condensate  water  by flowing over the tubes as shown in the adjacent diagram  such condensers use
or -driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain  
for best efficiency  the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam  since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100c where the
of water is much less than atmospheric pressure  the condenser generally works under   thus leaks of non-condensible air into the closed loop must be prevented 
typically the cooling water causes the steam to condense at a temperature of about 25c  77f  and that creates an
in the condenser of about 27kpa  0.592.07inhg   i e  a
of about 95kpa  28inhg  relative to atmospheric pressure  the large decrease in volume that occurs when water vapor condenses to liquid creates the low vacuum that helps pull steam through and increase the efficiency of the turbines 
the limiting factor is the temperature of the cooling water and that  in turn  is limited by the prevailing average climatic conditions at the power plant s location  it may be possible to lower the temperature beyond the turbine limits during winter  causing excessive condensation in the turbine   plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer  unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for  
the condenser generally uses either circulating cooling water from a
to reject waste heat to the atmosphere  or once-through water from a river  lake or ocean 
a marley mechanical induced draft cooling tower
the heat absorbed by the circulating cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain the ability of the water to cool as it circulates  this is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either natural draft  forced draft or induced draft
 as seen in the image to the right  that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation  by about 11to17c  20to30f expelling
to the atmosphere  the circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500
unit is about 14.2 m s  500ft s or 225,000 us gal min  at full load 
the condenser tubes are made of
or
to resist corrosion from either side  nevertheless  they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling  all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce   many plants include an automatic cleaning system that circulates sponge rubber balls through the tubes to scrub them clean without the need to take the system off-line   
the cooling water used to condense the steam in the condenser returns to its source without having been changed other than having been warmed  if the water returns to a local water body  rather than a circulating cooling tower   it is often tempered with cool  raw  water to prevent thermal shock when discharged into that body of water  
another form of condensing system is the air-cooled condenser  the process is similar to that of a
and fan  exhaust heat from the low pressure section of a steam turbine runs through the condensing tubes  the tubes are usually finned and ambient air is pushed through the fins with the help of a large fan  the steam condenses to water to be reused in the water-steam cycle  air-cooled condensers typically operate at a higher temperature than water-cooled versions  while saving water  the efficiency of the cycle is reduced  resulting in more carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity  
from the bottom of the condenser  powerful
recycle the condensed steam  water  back to the water steam cycle 
reheater  
power plant furnaces may have a reheater section containing tubes heated by hot flue gases outside the tubes  exhaust steam from the high pressure turbine is passed through these heated tubes to collect more energy before driving the intermediate and then low pressure turbines 
air path  
external fans are provided to give sufficient air for combustion  the primary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and  first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy  primary air then passes through the coal pulverizers  and carries the coal dust to the burners for injection into the furnace  the secondary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and  first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy  secondary air is mixed with the coal primary air flow in the burners 
the induced draft fan assists the fd fan by drawing out combustible gases from the furnace  maintaining a slightly negative pressure in the furnace to avoid leakage of combustion products from the boiler casing 
steam turbine generator  
main article 
rotor of a modern steam turbine  used in a power station
the turbine generator consists of a series of steam
interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft  there is usually a high pressure turbine at one end  followed by an intermediate pressure turbine  and finally one  two  or three low pressure turbines  and the generator  as steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy it expands in volume  requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy  the entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and 100 feet  30m  long  it is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down  at 3   so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced  this is so important that it is one of only six functions of blackout emergency power batteries on site  other functions are     station alarms  generator hydrogen seal system  and turbogenerator lube oil 
for a typical late 20th century power plant  superheated steam from the boiler is delivered through 1416-inch  360410mm  diameter piping at 2,400psi  17mpa  and 1,000f  540c  to the high pressure turbine where it falls in pressure to 600psi  4.1mpa  and to 600f  320c  in temperature through the stage  it exits via 2426-inch  610660mm  diameter cold reheat lines and passes back into the boiler where the steam is reheated in special reheat pendant tubes back to 1,000f  540c   the hot reheat steam is conducted to the intermediate pressure turbine where it falls in both
and
and exits directly to the long-bladed low pressure turbines and finally exits to the condenser 
the generator  30 feet  9m  long and 12 feet  3.7m  in diameter  contains a stationary
and a spinning   each containing miles of heavy
conductorno permanent

and
as the combustion
exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates  this is called the   the gas exiting the boiler is laden with   which are tiny spherical ash particles  the flue gas contains
along with combustion products     and   the fly ash is removed by
or   once removed  the fly ash byproduct can sometimes be used in the manufacturing of   this cleaning up of flue gases  however  only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology  still  the majority of coal-fired power plants in the world do not have these facilities    legislation in europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution  japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the us has been doing the same for over 25 years  china is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power plants 
where required by law  the sulfur and nitrogen oxide
are removed by
which use a pulverized
or other
wet slurry to remove those pollutants from the exit stack gas  other devices use catalysts to remove nitrous oxide compounds from the flue gas stream  the gas travelling up the
may by this time have dropped to about 50c  120f   a typical flue gas stack may be 150180 metres  490590ft  tall to disperse the remaining flue gas components in the atmosphere  the tallest flue gas stack in the world is 419.7 metres  1,377ft  tall at the
power plant in    
in the united states and a number of other countries 
studies are required to determine the flue gas stack height needed to comply with the local
regulations  the united states also requires the height of a flue gas stack to comply with what is known as the    gep   stack height  in the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the gep stack height  any air pollution dispersion modeling studies for such stacks must use the gep stack height rather than the actual stack height 
fly ash collection  
is captured and removed from the flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or fabric bag filters  or sometimes both  located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan  the fly ash is periodically removed from the collection hoppers below the precipitators or bag filters  generally  the fly ash is pneumatically transported to storage silos for subsequent transport by trucks or railroad cars 
bottom ash collection and disposal  
at the bottom of the furnace  there is a hopper for collection of   this hopper is always filled with water to quench the ash and clinkers falling down from the furnace  some arrangement is included to crush the clinkers and for conveying the crushed clinkers and bottom ash to a storage site  ash extractor is used to discharge ash from municipal solid wastefired boilers 
auxiliary systems  
boiler make-up water treatment plant and storage  
since there is continuous withdrawal of steam and continuous return of
to the boiler  losses due to
and leakages have to be made up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum  for this  continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system  impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of
and
salts which impart
to the water  hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes  thus  the salts have to be removed from the water  and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant  dm   a dm plant generally consists of cation  anion  and mixed bed exchangers  any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions  which recombine to form pure water  very pure dm water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen 
the capacity of the dm plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input  however  some storage is essential as the dm plant may be down for maintenance  for this purpose  a storage tank is installed from which dm water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up  the storage tank for dm water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water  such as   the piping and valves are generally of stainless steel  sometimes  a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided on top of the water in the tank to avoid contact with air  dm water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the
 i e   the vacuum side   this arrangement not only sprays the water but also dm water gets deaerated  with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser 
fuel preparation system  
conveyor system for moving coal  visible at far left  into a power plant
in coal-fired power stations  the raw feed coal from the coal storage area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal feed hoppers at the boilers  the coal is next
into a very fine powder  the pulverizers may be   rotating drum   or other types of grinders 
some power stations burn
rather than coal  the oil must kept warm  above its   in the fuel oil storage tanks to prevent the oil from congealing and becoming unpumpable  the oil is usually heated to about 100c before being pumped through the furnace fuel oil spray nozzles 
boilers in some power stations use
as their main fuel  other power stations may use processed natural gas as auxiliary fuel in the event that their main fuel supply  coal or oil  is interrupted  in such cases  separate gas burners are provided on the boiler furnaces 
barring gear  
 or  turning gear   is the mechanism provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft at a very low speed after unit stoppages  once the unit is  tripped   i e   the steam inlet valve is closed   the turbine coasts down towards standstill  when it stops completely  there is a tendency for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long  this is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in the top half of the casing  making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half  the shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches 
this small shaft deflection  only detectable by eccentricity meters  would be enough to cause damaging vibrations to the entire steam turbine generator unit when it is restarted  the shaft is therefore automatically turned at low speed  about one percent rated speed  by the barring gear until it has cooled sufficiently to permit a complete stop 
oil system  
an auxiliary oil system pump is used to supply oil at the start-up of the steam turbine generator  it supplies the hydraulic oil system required for steam turbine s main inlet steam stop valve  the governing control valves  the bearing and seal oil systems  the relevant hydraulic relays and other mechanisms 
at a preset speed of the turbine during start-ups  a pump driven by the turbine main shaft takes over the functions of the auxiliary system 
generator cooling  
while small generators may be cooled by air drawn through filters at the inlet  larger units generally require special cooling arrangements 
gas cooling  in an oil-sealed casing  is used because it has the highest known
of any gas and for its low
which reduces
losses  this system requires special handling during start-up  with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by
before filling with hydrogen  this ensures that the highly
hydrogen does not mix with
in the air 
the hydrogen pressure inside the casing is maintained slightly higher than
to avoid outside air ingress  the hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing  mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals  seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere 
the generator also uses water cooling  since the generator coils are at a potential of about 22   an insulating barrier such as teflon is used to interconnect the water line and the generator high-voltage windings  demineralized water of low conductivity is used  it is the importance of generator cooling 
generator high-voltage system  
the generator voltage for modern utility-connected generators ranges from 11 kv in smaller units to 30 kv in larger units  the generator high-voltage leads are normally large aluminium channels because of their high current as compared to the cables used in smaller machines  they are enclosed in well-grounded aluminium bus ducts and are supported on suitable insulators  the generator high-voltage leads are connected to step-up
for connecting to a high-voltage
 usually in the range of 115 kv to 765 kv  for further transmission by the local power grid 
the necessary
and metering devices are included for the high-voltage leads  thus  the steam turbine generator and the transformer form one unit  smaller units may share a common generator step-up transformer with individual circuit breakers to connect the generators to a common bus 
monitoring and alarm system  
most of the power plant operational controls are automatic  however  at times  manual intervention may be required  thus  the plant is provided with monitors and alarm systems that alert the plant operators when certain operating parameters are seriously deviating from their normal range 
battery-supplied emergency lighting and communication  
a central battery system consisting of
units is provided to supply emergency electric power  when needed  to essential items such as the power plant s control systems  communication systems generator hydrogen seal system  turbine lube oil pumps  and emergency lighting  this is essential for a safe  damage-free shutdown of the units in an emergency situation

the consumption of cooling water by inland power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 20402069 
transport of coal fuel to site and to storage  
main article 
most thermal stations use coal as the main fuel  raw coal is transported from
to a power station site by    
or
cars  generally  when shipped by railways  the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars  the coal received at site may be of different sizes  the railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary dumpers or side tilt dumpers to tip over onto conveyor belts below  the coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about 34 inch  19mm  size  the crushed coal is then sent by belt conveyors to a storage pile  normally  the crushed coal is compacted by bulldozers  as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition   
the crushed coal is conveyed from the storage pile to silos or hoppers at the boilers by another belt conveyor system
