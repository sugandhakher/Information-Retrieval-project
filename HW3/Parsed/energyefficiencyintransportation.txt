velomobile  the most efficient means of passenger transportation
energy
in transportation is  strictly speaking  useful output  kilometers  miles  etc   divided by total energy input  kilowatt-hour  amount of gasoline  etc    this is more precisely known as fuel economy  symbol fe   and may be measured in units of km l or mi gal  mpg  
energy efficiency in transportation is often  and confusingly  described in terms of fuel consumption  symbol fc   fuel consumption is the reciprocal of fuel economy and is occasionally known as energy intensity  it equals fuel  energy  divided by distance  and is often measured in units of liters per 100 kilometers  l 100km   joules per kilometer  j km   gallon-equivalent per 100 miles  gale 100mi   or kilowatt-hours per distance  kw-hr km or kw-hr mi  
the

units of measurement  
both fuel economy and fuel consumption are often given on a per-vehicle basis  more refined units of measurement exist  such as fuel consumption per passenger or fuel consumption per mass of cargo 
energy efficiency is expressed in terms of fuel economy 
distance per vehicle per unit fuel volume  e g   km l or  
distance per vehicle per unit fuel mass  e g   km kg 
distance per vehicle per unit energy  e g  
 mpg-e  
energy intensity  reciprocal efficiency  is expressed terms of fuel consumption 
volume of fuel  or total energy  consumed per unit distance per vehicle  e g  l 100km or mj 100km 
volume of fuel  or total energy  consumed per unit distance per passenger  e g   l  100passengerkm  
volume of fuel  or total energy  consumed per unit distance per unit mass of
transported  e g   l 100kgkm or mj tkm

walking  
a 68kg  150lb  person
at 4km h  2.5mph  requires approximately 210 kilocalories  880kj  of
per hour  which is equivalent to 4.55km mj  1usgal  3.8l  of gasoline contains about 114,000
 120mj  of energy  so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon  0.65l 100km

seem to have the highest energy efficiency in personal transportation  at a speed of 50km h  31mph  the waw manufacturer claims they need only 0.5kwh of
per 100km to transport the passenger  which is around 15  20   of a normal   and 150  2   of an average fossil fuel or electric car  this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon  2000km l  0.05l 100km   other sources give a figure of 13.4  29.5   of the energy use of a normal bicycle 
bicycling  
a chinese
bicycle
a relatively light and slow vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient
  the
is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport  compared with walking  a 64kg  140lb  cyclist riding at 16km h  10mph  requires about half the food energy per unit distance  43 mi  27 km or 3.1kwh  11mj  per 100km  this converts to about 732mpg-us  0.321l 100km  879mpg-imp   this figure depends on the speed and mass of the rider  greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance 
a
allows human power and the assistance of a 49cm3  3.0cuin  engine  giving a range of 160to 200mpg-us  1.51.2l 100km  190240mpg-imp     electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0kwh  3.6mj  per 100km    while maintaining speeds in excess of 30km h  19mph     these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70  of the work  with around 3.6mj  1.0kwh  per 100km coming from the motor 
human power  
to be thorough  a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing  transporting and packaging of fuel  food or fossil fuel   the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste  and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle  this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment  while automobiles  for example  require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans  in addition  any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity  in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40

is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres  l 100km   but in some countries  including the usa  uk and india  it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed  km l or miles per us or imperial gallon   this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel  the oak ridge national laboratory  ornl  states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 british thermal unit  btu  per us gallon  32mj l  compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon  36.4mj l  for diesel 
a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy  bio-fuels 
and   for instance  have significant energy inputs in their production  because of this  the 5070  efficiency of
has to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency 
a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle  as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases  however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger  we can compare  for instance  the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58 
finally  vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself  this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span  in other words  vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not  and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem  compare  for example  walking  which requires no special equipment at all  and an automobile  produced in and shipped from another country  and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again  and used for a limited number of years 
driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15

a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is   which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress 
is proportional to the
required for flight  which is equal to the weight of the aircraft  as induced drag increases with weight  mass reduction  with improvements in engine efficiency and reductions in   has been a principal source of efficiency gains in aircraft  with a rule-of-thumb being that a 1  weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75  reduction in fuel consumption 
flight altitude affects engine efficiency  jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the   the temperature minimum of the atmosphere  at lower temperatures  the
is higher  jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds  but above about mach 0.85 the airframe aerodynamic losses increase faster 
compressibility effects  beginning at
speeds of around mach 0.85  shockwaves form increasing drag 
for supersonic flight  it is difficult to achieve a
greater than 5  and fuel consumption is increased in proportion

passenger airplanes averaged 4.8 l 100km per passenger  1.4 mj passenger-km   49 passenger-miles per gallon  in 1998    note that on average 20  of seats are left unoccupied  jet aircraft efficiencies are improving  between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55  overall
gain  if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case   most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use  compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s  current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile  between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4

air france airbus a380-800
the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as  
and other composite plastics  expensive materials may be used  if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency  the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction  reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried  this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency  for example  the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials 
airbus has showcased
 sharklets or winglets  that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption  there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380  further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption  winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing smooth out the wing-tip vortex  reducing the aircraft s wing drag  and can be retrofitted to any airplane 
nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500lb  230kg     aircraft  this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift  not just the wings  the blended wing body  bwb  concept offers advantages in structural  aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today s more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs  these features translate into greater range  fuel economy  reliability and life cycle savings  as well as lower manufacturing costs  nasa has created a cruise efficient stol  cestol  concept 
fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research  ifam  have researched a
skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect  aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium
and
such as the shark skin imitating paint 
propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than
or   but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450mph  700km h   this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today  however  the decrease in speed reduces drag  with the current    high price for
and the emphasis on engine airframe efficiency to reduce emissions  there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the
and xwb  for instance  airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans  nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project  atp   where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds

queen elizabeth  
states that
travels 49.5 feet per imperial gallon of diesel oil  3.32m l or 41.2ft usgal   and that it has a passenger capacity of 1777  thus carrying 1777 passengers we can calculate an efficiency of 16.7 passenger miles per imperial gallon  16.9l 100pkm or 13.9pmpgus  
cruise ships

sailboats  
a   much like a solar car  can locomote without consuming any fuel  a sail boat such as a dinghy using just wind power requires no input energy in terms of fuel  however some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes  in addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion  such as cooking  heating or lighting  the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine  the speed at which it travels  and its displacement  due to the high viscosity of water  with a single passenger  the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car  train  or plane 
trains  
trains can be an efficient means of transport for freight and passengers  efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads  and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply  for electrified systems   and  importantly  end-to-end delivery  where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey 
actual consumption depends on gradients  maximum speeds  loading and stopping patterns  data produced for the european meet project  methodologies for estimating air pollutant emissions  illustrate the different consumption patterns over several track sections  the results show the consumption for a german ice high-speed train varied from around 19to 33kwh km  68119mj km  3153kwh mi   the data also reflects the weight of the train per passenger  for example 
double-deck duplex trains use lightweight materials  which keep axle loads down and reduce damage to track and also save energy

considering only the energy spent to move the train  and taking as example the urban area of   train seems to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobile for transportation of passengers  if we consider energy spent per passenger-km  considering an automobile which has a consumptions of around 6l 100km  47mpg-imp  39mpg-us  of gasoline  the fact the on average cars in europe have an occupation ratio of around 1.2 passengers per automobile and that one litre of gasoline   one gets on average 441wh  1,590kj  per passenger-km  on the other hand  a modern urban train with an average occupation of 20  of total capacity  which has a consumption of about 8.5kwh km  31mj km  13.7kwh mi   one gets 21.5 wh per passenger-km  20 times less than the automobile 
braking losses  
stopping is a considerable source of inefficiency  modern electric trains like the
 the bullet train  use
to return current into the
while they brake  a siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6  of the total energy consumed  the passenger rail  urban and intercity  and scheduled intercity and all charter bus industries technological and operational improvements  final report states that  commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops   and that  we estimate
to be 35 percent  but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent  of total energy consumed by commuter railways   having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite
which can recover typically around 20  of the energy wasted in braking  weight is a determinant of braking losses

international transport comparisons  
uk public transport  
rail and bus are generally required to serve  off peak  and rural services  which by their nature have lower loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines  moreover  due to their  walk on  ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers  as a consequence  the overall load factor on uk railways is 35  or 90 people per train 
conversely  air services work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are  pre-book  in nature  using
overall loads can be raised to around 7090   however  recently intercity train operators have been using similar techniques  with loads reaching typically 71  overall for
