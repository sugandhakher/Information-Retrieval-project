of all australians of voting age  and must receive a  double majority   a majority of all votes  and a majority of votes in a majority of states 
the commonwealth constitution also provides that the states can agree to refer any of their powers to the commonwealth  this may be achieved by way of an amendment to the constitution via referendum  a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the states to the commonwealth  or vice versa  should be implemented   more commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved  this  transfer  legislation may have a  sunset clause   a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period  at which point the original division of power is restored 
in addition  australia has several territories  three of which are self-governing  the
 act   the
 nt  and   the legislatures of these territories exercise powers delegated to them by the commonwealth  and the commonwealth parliament retains the power to override territorial legislation and to transfer powers to or from the territories  australian citizens living in the australian capital territory and the northern territory are directly represented in the commonwealth parliament  norfolk islanders are not represented federally per se  but residents of norfolk island are entitled to enrol in a

has 48 members while
has five  but the
is elected on a basis of equality among the states  all states elect 12 senators  regardless of population  this was intended to allow the senators of the smaller states to form a majority and amend or even reject bills originating in the house of representatives  the act and the nt also elect two senators each

and subsidiary federal courts 
the

the legislature proposes laws in the form of bills  and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms  the sovereign is formally a part of the parliament  but takes no active role in these matters
the executive enacts the laws by royal assent  administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation
the judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law  using both

the other arms cannot influence the judiciary
