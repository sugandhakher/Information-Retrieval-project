george stephenson
the institution of mechanical engineers was founded on 27 january 1847  in the queen s hotel next to
in
by the railway pioneer
and others  the founding of the institution is said to have been spurred by outrage that   the most famous mechanical engineer of the age  had been refused admission to the
unless he sent in  a probationary essay as proof of his capacity as an engineer   however this account has been challenged as an exaggeration  though there was certainly coolness between stephenson and the institution of civil engineers  it is more likely that the motivation behind the founding of the institution of mechanical engineers was simply the need for a specific home for the growing number of mechanical engineers employed in the burgeoning railway and manufacturing industries 
proposed that george stephenson become the institution s first president in 1847  followed by his son    in 1849  beyer became vice president and was one of the first to present papers to the institution 
was the imeche s first treasurer  throughout the 19th and 20th centuries some of britain s most notable engineers held the position of president  including  
and   it operated from premises in birmingham until 1877 when it moved to london  taking up its present headquarters on birdcage walk in 1899

engineering committees  
the institution of mechanical engineers has a number of committees that work to promote and develop thought leadership in different industry sectors  the institution has 8 divisions  - aerospace  automobile  biomedical engineering association  construction   building services  cross-sector technologies  manufacturing industries  power industries  process industries and railway 
biomedical engineering association  bmea  aims to bring together key workers from both medicine and engineering to discuss the latest advances and issues  to enable networking among different industry leaders  and to promote the field of medical engineering  also known as
or   to government  healthcare professionals and the wider public  this committee offers 
seminars  lectures and conferences every year 
the journal of engineering in medicine 
the annual student project competition 
the railway division was formed in 1969 when imeche amalgamated with the institution of locomotive engineers
