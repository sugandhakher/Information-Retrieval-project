map of population density in italy as at the 2011 census 
at the end of 2013  italy had 60,782,668 inhabitants  the resulting population density  at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre  520 sqmi   is higher than that of most western european countries  however  the distribution of the population is widely uneven  the most densely populated areas are the po valley  that accounts for almost a half of the national population  and the metropolitan areas of rome and naples  while vast regions such as the alps and apennines highlands  the plateaus of basilicata and the island of sardinia are very sparsely populated 
the population of italy almost doubled during the 20th century  but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural south to the industrial cities of the north  a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the
of the 19501960s  high fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s  after which they start to dramatically decline  leading to rapid population ageing  at the end of the 2000s  decade   one in five italians was over 65 years old  however  in recent years italy experienced a significant growth in birth rates  the total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008  the
is expected to reach 1.61.8 in 2030 
from the late 19th century until the 1960s italy was a country of mass   between 1898 and 1914  the peak years of   approximately 750,000 italians emigrated each year  the diaspora concerned more than 25 million italians and it is considered the biggest mass migration of contemporary times  as a result  today more than 4.1 million italian citizens are living abroad  while at least 60 million people of full or part italian ancestry live outside of italy  most notably in argentina  brazil  uruguay  venezuela  the united states  canada  australia  and france
