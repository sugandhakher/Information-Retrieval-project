a negative carbon dioxide emission or negative emission or a process that is carbon negative gives a permanent removal of the

negative emissions is different from reducing emissions  as the former produces an outlet of carbon dioxide from   whereas the latter decreases the inlet of   both have the same momentary net effect  but for achieving carbon dioxide concentration levels below present levels  such as   negative emissions are critical  also for meeting higher concentration levels  negative emissions are increasingly considered to be crucial as they provide the only possibility to fill the gap between needed reductions to meet

carbon dioxide sinks and negative carbon dioxide emissions  
a
such as a concentrated group of plants or any other primary producer that binds
into biomass  such as within forests and   is not carbon negative  as sinks are not permanent  a carbon dioxide sink of this type moves   in the form of carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere or hydrosphere to the biosphere  this process could be undone  for example by
or  
carbon dioxide sinks that store carbon dioxide in the earth s crust by   or in the form of insoluble
salts     are considered carbon negative  this is because they are removing carbon from the atmosphere and
it indefinitely and presumably for a considerable duration  thousands to millions of years
