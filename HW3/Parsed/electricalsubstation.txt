a substation is a part of an electrical     and
system  substations transform
from high to low  or the reverse  or perform any of several other important functions  between the generating station and consumer  electric power may flow through several substations at different voltage levels  a substation may include
to change voltage levels between high transmission voltages and lower distribution voltages  or at the interconnection of two different transmission voltages 
substations may be owned and operated by an electrical utility  or may be owned by a large industrial or commercial customer  generally substations are unattended  relying on
for remote supervision and control 
the word substation comes from the days before the distribution system became a   as central generation stations became larger  smaller generating plants were converted to distribution stations  receiving their energy supply from a larger plant instead of using their own generators  the first substations were connected to only one   where the generators were housed  and were subsidiaries of that power station

types  
substations may be described by their voltage class  their applications within the power system  the method used to insulate most connections  and by the style and materials of the structures used  these categories are not disjointed  for example  to solve a particular problem  a transmission substation may include significant distribution functions 
transmission substation  
a transmission substation connects two or more transmission lines  the simplest case is where all transmission lines have the same voltage  in such cases  substation contains high-voltage switches that allow lines to be connected or isolated for fault clearance or maintenance  a transmission station may have
to convert between two transmission voltages    devices such as capacitors  reactors or
and equipment such as
to control power flow between two adjacent power systems 
transmission substations can range from simple to complex  a small  switching station  may be little more than a
plus some   the largest transmission substations can cover a large area  several acres hectares  with multiple voltage levels  many circuit breakers  and a large amount of protection and control equipment   
and
systems   modern substations may be implemented using international standards such as  
distribution substation  
a distribution substation in  
disguised as a house  complete with a driveway  front walk and a mown lawn and shrubs in the front yard  a warning notice can be clearly seen on the  front door   disguises for substations are common in many cities 
a distribution substation transfers power from the transmission system to the distribution system of an area  it is uneconomical to directly connect electricity consumers to the main transmission network  unless they use large amounts of power  so the distribution station reduces voltage to a level suitable for local distribution 
the input for a distribution substation is typically at least two transmission or sub-transmission lines  input voltage may be  for example  115kv  or whatever is common in the area  the output is a number of feeders  distribution voltages are typically medium voltage  between 2.4kv and 33kv  depending on the size of the area served and the practices of the local utility  the feeders run along streets overhead  or underground  in some cases  and power the distribution transformers at or near the customer premises 
in addition to transforming voltage  distribution substations also isolate faults in either the transmission or distribution systems  distribution substations are typically the points of   although on long distribution circuits  of several miles kilometers   voltage regulation equipment may also be installed along the line 
the downtown areas of large cities feature complicated distribution substations  with high-voltage switching  and switching and backup systems on the low-voltage side  more typical distribution substations have a switch  one transformer  and minimal facilities on the low-voltage side 
collector substation  
in
projects such as a   a collector substation may be required  it resembles a distribution substation although power flow is in the opposite direction  from many
up into the transmission grid  usually for economy of construction the collector system operates around 35kv  and the collector substation steps up voltage to a transmission voltage for the grid  the collector substation can also provide
if it is needed  metering  and control of the wind farm  in some special cases a collector substation can also contain an hvdc converter station 
collector substations also exist where multiple thermal or hydroelectric power plants of comparable output power are in proximity  examples for such substations are
in germany and
in the czech republic  where power is collected from nearby -fired power plants  if no transformers are required for increasing the voltage to transmission level  the substation is a switching station 
converter substations  
converter substations may be associated with
converter plants    or interconnected non-synchronous networks  these stations contain power electronic devices to change the frequency of current  or else convert from alternating to direct current or the reverse  formerly
changed frequency to interconnect two systems  nowadays such substations are rare 
switching station  
switchyard at   usa  2006
a switching station is a substation without transformers and operating only at a single voltage level  switching stations are sometimes used as collector and distribution stations  sometimes they are used for switching the current to back-up lines or for parallelizing circuits in case of failure  an example is the switching stations for the
transmission line 
a switching station may also be known as a switchyard  and these are commonly located directly adjacent to or nearby a   in this case the generators from the power station supply their power into the yard onto the generator bus on one side of the yard  and the transmission lines take their power from a feeder bus on the other side of the yard 
former high-voltage substation in stuttgart  germany  now 110kv switching station  the 220kv level is eliminated for grid simplification 
an important function performed by a substation is   which is the connecting and disconnecting of transmission lines or other components to and from the system  switching events may be planned or unplanned  a transmission line or other component may need to be de-energized for maintenance or for new construction  for example  adding or removing a transmission line or a transformer  to maintain reliability of supply  companies aim at keeping the system up and running while performing maintenance  all work to be performed  from routine testing to adding entirely new substations  should be done while keeping the whole system running 
unplanned switching events are caused by a
in a transmission line or any other component  for example 
a line is hit by lightning and develops an  
a
is blown down by high wind 
the function of the switching station is to isolate the faulty portion of the system in the shortest possible time  de-energizing faulty equipment protects it from further damage  and isolating a fault helps keep the rest of the electrical grid operating with stability 
railways  
main article 
electrified railways also use substations  often distribution substations  in some cases a conversion of the current type takes place  commonly with
for
 dc  trains  or
for trains using
 ac  at frequencies other than that of the public grid  sometimes they are also transmission substations or collector substations if the railway network also operates its own grid and generators 
design  
the
substation in
is canada s oldest substation  in continuous operation since 1901  it has a facade in clay brick with grey stone ornaments  to blend in to its downtown environment 
elements of a substation  
substations generally have switching  protection and control equipment  and transformers  in a large substation 
are used to interrupt any
or overload currents that may occur on the network  smaller distribution stations may use
or
for protection of distribution circuits  substations themselves do not usually have generators  although a
may have a substation nearby  other devices such as
and
may also be located at a substation 
substations may be on the surface in fenced enclosures  underground  or located in special-purpose buildings  high-rise buildings may have several indoor substations  indoor substations are usually found in urban areas to reduce the noise from the transformers  for reasons of appearance  or to protect switchgear from extreme climate or pollution conditions 
a
 earthing  system must be designed  the total   and the gradients in potential during a fault  called touch and step potentials   must be calculated to protect passers-by during a short-circuit in the transmission system  earth faults at a substation can cause a   currents flowing in the earth s surface during a fault can cause metal objects to have a significantly different voltage than the ground under a person s feet  this touch potential presents a hazard of electrocution  where a substation has a metallic fence  it must be properly grounded to protect people from this hazard 
the main issues facing a
are reliability and cost  a good design attempts to strike a balance between these two  to achieve reliability without excessive cost  the design should also allow expansion of the station  when required 
location selection  
selection of the location of a substation must consider many factors  sufficient land area is required for installation of equipment with necessary clearances for electrical safety  and for access to maintain large apparatus such as transformers 
where land is costly  such as in urban areas  gas insulated
may save money overall  substations located in coastal areas affected by flooding and tropical storms may often require an elevated structure to keep equipment sensitive to surges hardened against these elements  the site must have room for expansion due to load growth or planned transmission additions  environmental effects of the substation must be considered  such as   noise and road traffic effects 
the substation site must be reasonably central to the distribution area to be served  the site must be secure from intrusion by passers-by  both to protect people from injury by electric shock or arcs  and to protect the electrical system from misoperation due to vandalism 
design diagrams  
tottenham substation  set in wild parkland in north london 
the first step in planning a substation layout is the preparation of a   which shows in simplified form the switching and protection arrangement required  as well as the incoming supply lines and outgoing feeders or transmission lines  it is a usual practice by many electrical utilities to prepare one-line diagrams with principal elements  lines  switches  circuit breakers  transformers  arranged on the page similarly to the way the apparatus would be laid out in the actual station 
in a common design  incoming lines have a disconnect switch and a   in some cases  the lines will not have both  with either a switch or a circuit breaker being all that is considered necessary  a disconnect switch is used to provide isolation  since it cannot interrupt load current  a circuit breaker is used as a protection device to interrupt fault currents automatically  and may be used to switch loads on and off  or to cut off a line when power is flowing in the  wrong  direction  when a large fault current flows through the circuit breaker  this is detected through the use of   the magnitude of the current transformer outputs may be used to trip the circuit breaker resulting in a disconnection of the load supplied by the circuit break from the feeding point  this seeks to isolate the fault point from the rest of the system  and allow the rest of the system to continue operating with minimal impact  both switches and circuit breakers may be operated locally  within the substation  or remotely from a supervisory control center 
with   the propagation of
and switching
can cause
failures into substation equipment  line entrance
are used to protect substation equipment accordingly  insulation coordination studies are carried out extensively to ensure equipment failure  and associated   is minimal 
once past the switching components  the lines of a given voltage connect to one or more   these are sets of   usually in multiples of three  since
electrical power distribution is largely universal around the world 
the arrangement of switches  circuit breakers  and buses used affects the cost and reliability of the substation  for important substations a ring bus  double bus  or so-called  breaker and a half  setup can be used  so that the failure of any one circuit breaker does not interrupt power to other circuits  and so that parts of the substation may be de-energized for maintenance and repairs  substations feeding only a single industrial load may have minimal switching provisions  especially for small installations 
this single-line diagram illustrates the breaker and a half concept often used in switchyards 
once having established buses for the various voltage levels  transformers may be connected between the voltage levels  these will again have a circuit breaker  much like transmission lines  in case a transformer has a fault  commonly called a  short circuit   
along with this  a substation always has control circuitry needed to command the various circuit breakers to open in case of the failure of some component 
automation  
main article 
early electrical substations required manual switching or adjustment of equipment  and manual collection of data for load  energy consumption  and abnormal events  as the complexity of distribution networks grew  it became economically necessary to automate supervision and control of substations from a centrally attended point  to allow overall coordination in case of emergencies and to reduce operating costs  early efforts to remote control substations used dedicated communication wires  often run alongside power circuits     
cables as well as dedicated wired remote control circuits have all been applied to
 scada  for substations  the development of the
made for an exponential increase in the number of points that could be economically controlled and monitored  today  standardized communication protocols such as  
and   to list a few  are used to allow multiple intelligent electronic devices to communicate with each other and supervisory control centers  distributed automatic control at substations is one element of the so-called  
insulation  
switches  circuit breakers  transformers and other apparatus may be interconnected by air-insulated bare conductors strung on support structures  the air space required increases with system voltage and with the lightning surge voltage rating  for medium-voltage distribution substations  metal-enclosed switch gear may be used and no live conductors exposed at all  for higher voltages  gas-insulated switch gear reduces the space required around live bus  instead of bare conductors  bus and apparatus are built into pressurized tubular containers filled with
 sf6  gas  this gas has a higher insulating value than air  allowing the dimensions of the apparatus to be reduced  in addition to air or sf6 gas  apparatus will use other insulation materials such as   paper  porcelain  and polymer insulators 
structure  
outdoor  above-ground substation structures include wood pole  lattice metal tower  and tubular metal structures  although other variants are available  where space is plentiful and appearance of the station is not a factor  steel lattice towers provide low-cost supports for transmission lines and apparatus  low-profile substations may be specified in suburban areas where appearance is more critical  indoor substations may be gas-insulated switchgear  at high voltages   or metal-enclosed or metal-clad switchgear at lower voltages  urban and suburban indoor substations may be finished on the outside so as to blend in with other buildings in the area 
a compact substation is generally an outdoor substation built in a metal enclosure  in which each item of the electrical equipment is located very near to each other to create a relatively smaller footprint size of the substation
