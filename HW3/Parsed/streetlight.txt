history  
main articles 
and
preindustrial era  
early lamps were used by greek and roman civilizations    where light primarily served the purpose of   both to protect the wanderer from tripping on the path over something or keeping the potential robbers at bay    at that time oil lamps were used predominantly as they provided a long-lasting and moderate flame  the romans had a word  lanternarius   which was a term for a slave responsible for lighting the oil lamps in front of their villas  this task remained the responsibility of a designated person up to the middle ages where the so-called    escorted people from one place to another through the murky winding streets of medieval towns 
before
lamps 
was employed in cities  the earliest lamps required that a
tour the town at dusk  lighting each of the lamps  according to some sources  illumination was ordered in
in 1417 by sir  
though there is no firm evidence of this 
in 1524  paris house owners were required to have lanterns with candles lit in front of their houses at night  but the law was often ignored  following the invention of lanterns with glass windows  which greatly improved the quantity of light  in 1594 the police of paris took charge of installing lanterns in each city neighborhood  still  in 1662  it was a common practice for travelers to hire a lantern-bearer if they had to move at night through the dark  winding streets  lantern bearers were still common in paris until 1789  in 1667  under king   the royal government began installing lanterns on all the streets  there were three thousand in place by 1669  and twice as many by 1729  lanterns with glass windows were suspended from a cord over the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet and were placed twenty yards apart  a much-improved oil lantern  called a rverbre  was introduced between 1745 and 1749  these lamps were attached to the top of lampposts  by 1817  there were 4694 lamps on the paris streets  during the
 1789-1799   the revolutionaries found that the lampposts were a convenient place to hang aristocrats and other opponents 
gas lamp lighting  
main article 
the first widespread system of street lighting used piped
as fuel 
was the first person who procured a flammable fluid from the actual distillation of coal in 1726 and john clayton  in 1735  called gas the  spirit  of coal and discovered its flammability by accident 
 s house in   uk  the first domestic house lit by gas in the world
 sometimes spelled  murdock   was the first to use the flammability of gas for the practical application of lighting  in the early 1790s  while overseeing the use of his company s steam engines in tin mining in cornwall  murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas  finally settling on coal-gas as the most effective  he first lit his own house in  
in 1792  in 1798  he used gas to light the main building of the soho foundry and in 1802 lit the outside in a public display of gas lighting  the lights astonishing the local population 
in paris  gas lighting was first demonstrated in november 1800 at a private residence on the rue saint-dominique  and was installed on a covered shopping street  the   in 1817  the first gas lamps on the streets of paris appeared in january 1829 on the place du carrousel and the rue de rivoli  then on rue de la paix  place vendme  rue de castiglione  by 1857 the grands boulevards were all lit with gas  a parisian writer enthused in august  1857   that which most enchants the parisians is the new lighting by gas of the boulevards   from the church of the madeleine all the way to rue montmartre  these two rows of lamps  shining with a clarity white and pure  have a marvelous effect   the gaslights installed on the boulevards and city monuments in the 19th century gave the city the nickname  the city of light  
the first public street lighting with gas was demonstrated in
on january 28  1807 by     in 1812 
granted a charter to the london and westminster   and the first gas company in the world came into being  less than two years later  on december 31  1813  the
was lit by gas   
following this success  gas lighting spread to other countries  the use of gas lights in  s museum in
in 1816 was a great success  baltimore was the first american city with gas streetlights  provided by peale s gas light company of baltimore 
the first place outside
in
to have gas lighting  was
in 1825  this was due to the preston gaslight company run by revolutionary   who found the most improved way of brighter gas lighting 
appeared in the field as a rival of coal-gas guff  in 1815 
patented an apparatus for the decomposition of  oil  and other animal substances  public attention was attracted to  oil-gas  by the display of the patent apparatus at   by  
the first modern street lamps to use kerosene were introduced in
in what was then the
in 1853  in   street lighting with
reappeared in 2009 in the shopping street as a tourist attraction 
farola fernandina  
farola fernandina is a traditional design of street light which remains popular in spain  essentially it is a neo-classical french gas lamp style dating from the late 18th century  it may be either a wall-bracket or standard lamp  the standard base is cast metal with an escutchion bearing two intertwined letters  f   the
of king
and commemorates the date of the birth of his daughter  the

on the avenue de l opera in paris  1878   the first form of electric street lighting
heritage lamp post in the  
the first electric street lighting employed   initially the  electric candle    jablotchkoff candle  or    developed by the russian
in 1875  this was a carbon arc lamp employing alternating current  which ensured that both electrodes were consumed at equal rates  in 1876  the common council of the city of los angeles ordered four arc lights installed in various places in the fledgling town for street lighting 
on may 30  1878  the first electric street lights in paris were installed on the avenue de l opera and the place d etoile  around the   to celebrate the opening of the   in 1881  to coincide with the paris international exposition of electricity  street lights were installed on the major boulevards 
the first streets in london lit with the electrical arc lamp were by the
and the
in 1878  more than 4,000 were in use by 1881  though by then an improved differential arc lamp had been developed by
of   the
was quick in adopting arc lighting  and by 1890 over 130,000 were in operation in the us  commonly installed in exceptionally tall  
arc lights had two major disadvantages  first  they emit an intense and harsh light which  although useful at industrial sites like dockyards  was discomforting in ordinary city streets  second  they are maintenance-intensive  as carbon electrodes burn away swiftly  with the development of cheap  reliable and bright
at the end of the 19th century  arc lights passed out of use for street lighting  but remained in industrial use longer 
the first street to be lit by an
was mosley street  in   the street was lit by  s incandescent lamp on 3 february 1879  consequently  newcastle was the first city in the world to be fully lit up by lighting  the first street to be lit with modern electricity as we know it was electric avenue in london s brixton in 1880  the first city in the united states  and second overall after newcastle  england   was the

and in
to have electric street lights - first lit on 1 september 1882   in central america   
was the first city  the system was launched on august 9  1884  with 25 lamps powered by a hydroelectric plant 
old street light in   brandenburg
  in present-day   was the first city in
to have electric public lighting on 12 november 1884  731 lamps were used  in 1886  the tiny  isolated mining town of waratah in nw tasmania was the first to have electrically powered street lighting in australia  on 9 december 1882    queensland  australia was introduced to electricity by having a demonstration of using eight arc lights  erected along   the power to supply these arc lights was taken from a 10hp crompton dc generator driven by a robey steam engine in a small foundry in adelaide street and occupied by
the lamps were erected on cast iron standards  20ft in height  in 1888    
became the first location in new south wales to have electric street lighting  for which that city erroneously maintains the title of  first city of light  
incandescent lamps were primarily used for street lighting until the advent of high-intensity discharge lamps  they were often operated at high-voltage   series circuits were popular since the higher voltage in these circuits produced more light per watt consumed  furthermore  before the invention of photoelectric controls  a single switch or clock could control all the lights in an entire district 
to avoid having the entire system go dark if a single lamp burned out  each street lamp was equipped with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact  early series street lights were equipped with isolation transformers  that would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not  later the film cutout was invented  the film cutout was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp  if the lamp failed  an    the
through the string became zero  causing the voltage of the circuit  thousands of volts  to be imposed across the insulating film  penetrating it  see    in this way  the failed lamp was bypassed and power restored to the rest of the district  the street light circuit contained an automatic current regulator  preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out  preserving the life of the remaining lamps  when the failed lamp was replaced  a new piece of film was installed  once again separating the contacts in the cutout  this system was recognizable by the large
insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the mounting arm  this was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp s base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground earth

low energy prismatic street lighting
today  street lighting commonly uses   often hps   such lamps provide the greatest amount of
illumination for the least consumption of electricity  however  white light sources have been shown to double driver peripheral vision and improve driver brake reaction time by at least 25   to enable pedestrians to better detect pavement trip hazards and to facilitate visual appraisals of other people associated with interpersonal judgements  studies comparing metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps have shown that at equal photopic light levels  a street scene illuminated at night by a metal halide lighting system was reliably seen as brighter and safer than the same scene illuminated by a high pressure sodium system 
two national standards now allow for variation in illuminance when using lamps of different spectra  in australia  hps lamp performance needs to be reduced by a minimum value of 75   in the uk  illuminances are reduced with higher values s p ratio
new street lighting technologies  such as
or   emit a white light that provides high levels of scotopic lumens allowing street lights with lower wattages and lower photopic lumens to replace existing street lights  however  there have been no formal specifications written around photopic scotopic adjustments for different types of light sources  causing many municipalities and street departments to hold back on implementation of these new technologies until the standards are updated  eastbourne in east sussex uk is currently undergoing a project to see 6000 of its street lights converted to led and will be closely followed by hastings in early 2014 
  is the first major city to have entirely switched to led lighting 
in north america  the city of
 canada  was one of the first and biggest led conversion projects with over 46,000 lights converted to led technology between 2012 and 2014  it is also one of the first cities in north america to use
technology to control the lights    a company based in   was chosen as a smart city partner for this project 
are gaining wider acceptance  preliminary field tests show that some led luminaires are energy-efficient and perform well in testing environments 
in 2007  the civil twilight collective created a variant of the conventional led streetlight  namely the lunar-resonant streetlight  these lights increase or decrease the intensity of the streetlight according to the
light  this streetlight design thus reduces energy consumption as well as light pollution 
measurement  
old style street light with lamps near the hunting lodge moenchbruch 
a street light during a snowfall
two very similar measurement systems were created to bridge the scotopic and photopic luminous efficiency functions  creating a unified system of photometry  this new measurement has been well-received because the reliance on v   alone for characterizing night-time light illuminations requires more electric energy  the cost-savings potential of using a new way to measure mesopic lighting scenarios is tremendous 
outdoor site-lighting performance  osp  is a method for predicting and measuring three different aspects of light pollution  glow  trespass and glare  using this method  lighting specifiers can quantify the performance of existing and planned lighting designs and applications to minimize excessive or obtrusive light leaving the boundaries of a property 
advantages  
major advantages of street lighting include prevention of accidents and increase in safety  studies have shown that darkness results in a large number of crashes and fatalities  especially those involving pedestrians  pedestrian fatalities are 3 to 6.75 times more likely in the dark than in daylight  street lighting has been found to reduce pedestrian crashes by approximately 50  
furthermore  lighted intersections and highway interchanges tend to have fewer crashes than unlighted intersections and interchanges 
towns  cities  and villages use the unique locations provided by lampposts to hang decorative or commemorative banners 
many communities in the us use lampposts as a tool for fund raising via lamppost banner sponsorship programs first designed by a us based lamppost banner manufacturer 
disadvantages  
the major criticisms of street lighting are that it can actually cause accidents if misused  and cause  
dangers  
there are two optical phenomena that need to be recognized in street light installations 
the loss of
because of the
of drivers  eyes is the greatest danger  as drivers emerge from an unlighted area into a pool of light from a street light their
quickly constrict to adjust to the brighter light  but as they leave the pool of light the dilation of their pupils to adjust to the dimmer light is much slower  so they are driving with impaired vision  as a person gets older the eye s recovery speed gets slower  so driving time and distance under impaired vision increases 
oncoming headlights are more visible against a black background than a grey one  the contrast creates greater awareness of the oncoming vehicle 
is also a concern in many cities  stray voltage can accidentally electrify lampposts and has the potential to injure or kill anyone who comes into contact with the post 
 the american medical association  ama  has just adopted anofficial policy statementabout street lighting  cool it and dim it  the statement  adopted unanimously at the ama s annual meeting     comes in response to the rise of new led street lighting sweeping the country  
 municipalities are replacing existing streetlights with efficient and long-lasting leds to save money on energy and maintenance  although the streetlights are delivering these benefits  the ama s stance reflects     the close connection between light and human health 
the new  white  led street lighting     has two problems  the first is discomfort and glare  because led light is so concentrated and has high blue content  it can cause severe glare     and sufficient levels can damage the retina  this can cause problems seeing clearly for safe driving or walking at night 
the other issue addressed by the ama statement is the impact on human circadian rhythmicity  lighting affects our normalcircadian physiology  this could lead to someserious health consequences  white led light     is estimated to be five times more effective atsuppressing melatoninat night than the high pressure sodium lamps  given the same light output  which have been the mainstay of street lighting for decades  melatonin suppression is a marker of circadian disruption  which includes disrupted sleep 
the ama  encourage s  minimizing and controlling blue-rich environmental lighting by using the lowest emission of blue light possible to reduce glare   all led lighting should be properly shielded  
there are also physical dangers other than children climbing them for recreational purposes  street light stanchions  lampposts  pose a collision risk to motorists and pedestrians  particularly those affected by poor eyesight or under the influence of alcohol  this can be reduced by designing them to break away when hit   or collapsible supports   protecting them by guardrails  or marking the lower portions to increase their visibility  high winds or accumulated
also occasionally topple street lights 
light pollution

in urban areas
can hide the stars and interfere with
and the migration of many bird species    in settings near astronomical
and   low pressure
may be used  these lamps are advantageous over other lamps such as
and
because low pressure sodium lamps emit lower intensity 
light  observatories can filter the sodium
out of their observations and virtually eliminate the interference from nearby urban lighting  full cutoff streetlights also reduce light pollution by reducing the amount of light that is directed at the sky which also improves the luminous efficiency of the light 
energy consumption  
globally 70  of all electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels  a source of air pollution including greenhouse gases  and also globally there are approximately 300 million street lights using that electricity  cities are exploring more   reducing street light power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours and switching to high-efficiency led lamps  a british county council has turned off 5  of its street lights on a trial basis 
street light control systems  
a number of street light control systems have been developed to control and reduce energy consumption of a town s public lighting system  these range from controlling a circuit of street lights and or individual lights with specific ballasts and network operating protocols  these may include sending and receiving instructions via separate data networks at high frequency over the top of the low voltage supply or wireless 
image-based street light control  
a number of companies are now manufacturing
that adjust light output based on usage and occupancy  i e  automating classification of pedestrian versus cyclist  versus automotive  sensing also velocity of movement and illuminating a certain number of streetlights ahead and fewer behind  depending on velocity of movement  also the lights adjust depending on road conditions  for example  snow produces more reflectance therefore reduced light is required 
purpose  
there are three distinct main uses of street lights  each requiring different types of lights and placement  misuse of the different types of lights can make the situation worse by compromising visibility or safety 
beacon lights  
decorative but functional lamps in the plaza at sunset 
a modest steady light at the intersection of two roads is an aid to navigation because it helps a driver see the location of a side road as they come closer to it and they can adjust their braking and know exactly where to turn if they intend to leave the main road or see vehicles or pedestrians  a beacon light s function is to say  here i am  and even a dim light provides enough contrast against the dark night to serve the purpose  to prevent the dangers caused by a car driving through a pool of light  a beacon light must never shine onto the main road  and not brightly onto the side road  in residential areas  this is usually the only appropriate lighting  and it has the bonus side effect of providing spill lighting onto any sidewalk there for the benefit of pedestrians  on interstate highways this purpose is commonly served by placing reflectors at the sides of the road 
roadway lights  
high mast lighting along
in    
conventional streetlights are used instead of high mast lighting near airport runway approaches due to the negative effects they cause 
because of the dangers discussed above  roadway lights are properly used sparingly and only when a particular situation justifies increasing the risk  this usually involves an intersection with several turning movements and much signage  situations where drivers must take in much information quickly that is not in the headlights  beam  in these situations  a freeway junction or exit ramp  the intersection may be lit so that drivers can quickly see all hazards  and a well designed plan will have gradually increasing lighting for approximately a quarter of a minute before the intersection and gradually decreasing lighting after it  the main stretches of highways remain unlighted to preserve the driver s night vision and increase the visibility of oncoming headlights  if there is a sharp curve where headlights will not illuminate the road  a light on the outside of the curve is often justified 
if it is desired to light a roadway  perhaps due to heavy and fast multi-lane traffic   to avoid the dangers of casual placement of street lights it should not be lit intermittently  as this requires repeated eye readjustment which implies
and temporary blindness when entering and leaving light pools  in this case the system is designed to eliminate the need for headlights  this is usually achieved with bright lights placed on high poles at close regular intervals so that there is consistent light along the route  the lighting goes from curb to curb

maintenance  
new york city street light status indicator
street lighting systems require ongoing maintenance  which can be classified as either reactive or preventative  reactive maintenance is a direct response to a lighting failure  such as replacing a discharge lamp after it has failed  or replacing an entire lighting unit after it has been hit by a vehicle  preventative maintenance is scheduled replacement of lighting components  for example replacing all of the discharge lamps in an area of the city when they have reached 85  of their expected life  in the united kingdom the roads liaison group has issued a
recommending specific reactive and preventative maintenance procedures 
some street lights in new york city have an orange or red light on top of the luminair  light fixture  or a red light attached to the lamppost  this indicates that near to this lighting pole or in the same intersection  there is a fire alarm pull box  other street lights have a small red light next to the street light bulb  when the small light flashes  it indicates an issue with the electrical current
