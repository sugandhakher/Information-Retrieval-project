this article is about the system to generate  transmit  distribute and use electricity  for other uses  see  
electrification is the process of powering by electricity and is usually associated with changing over from another power source  the broad meaning of the term  such as in the history of technology and economic history  usually applies to a region or national economy  broadly speaking  electrification was the build out of the
and distribution systems which occurred in britain  the united states  and other countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is in progress in rural areas in some developing countries  this included the change over from
and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors 
the electrification of particular sectors of the economy is called by terms such as   household electrification 
or   it may also apply to changing industrial processes such as smelting  melting  separating or refining from coal or coke heating  or chemical processes to some type of electric process such as  
or
heating  or
or electrolytic separating 
electrification was called  the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century  by the

development of magnetos  dynamos and generators  
main article 
faraday disk  the first electric generator  the horseshoe-shaped magnet  a  created a magnetic field through the disk  d   when the disk was turned  this induced an electric current radially outward from the center toward the rim  the current flowed out through the sliding spring contact m  through the external circuit  and back into the center of the disk through the axle 
in the years of 18311832 
discovered the operating principle of electromagnetic generators  the principle  later called   is that an
is generated in an electrical conductor that is subjected to a varying   as for example  a wire moving through a magnetic field  he also built the first electromagnetic generator  called the   a type of   using a
disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe   it produced a small dc voltage 
around 1832 
improved the magneto by using a wire wound horseshoe  with the extra coils of conductor generating more current  but it was ac 
suggested a means of converting current from pixii s magneto to dc using a rocking switch  later segmented commutators were used to produce direct current 
and
developed a telegraph around 1838-40  in 1840 wheatstone was using a magneto that he developed to power the telegraph  wheatstone and cooke made an important improvement in electrical generation by using a battery-powered electromagnet in place of a permanent magnet  which they patented in 1845  the self-excited magnetic field dynamo did away with the battery to power electromagnets  this type of dynamo was made by several people in 1866 
the first practical generator  the
was made by z t gramme  who sold many of these machines in the 1870s  british engineer
improved the generator to allow better air cooling and made other mechanical improvements  compound winding  which gave more stable voltage with load  improved operating characteristics of generators 
the improvements in electrical generation technology increased the efficiency and reliability greatly in the 19th century  the first magnetos only converted a few percent of mechanical energy to electricity  by the end of the 19th century the highest efficiencies were over 90  
electric lighting  
arc lighting  
yablochkov s demonstration of his brilliant arc lights at the 1878 paris exposition along the
triggered a steep sell off of gas utility stocks 
main article 
sir
invented the
in 1802 upon discovering that electricity could produce a light
with carbon electrodes  however  it was not used to any great extent until a practical means of generating electricity was developed 
carbon arc lamps were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes  which were then separated to within a narrow gap  because the carbon burned away  the gap had to be constantly readjusted  several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc  a common approach was to feed a carbon electrode by gravity and maintain the gap with a pair of electromagnets  one of which retracted the upper carbon after the arc was started and the second controlled a brake on the gravity feed 
arc lamps of the time had very intense light output  in the range of 4000
 candelas   and released a lot of heat  and they were a fire hazard  all of which made them inappropriate for lighting homes 
in the 1850s  many of these problems were solved by the arc lamp invented by william petrie and william staite  the lamp used a magneto-electric generator and had a self-regulating mechanism to control the gap between the two carbon rods  their light was used to light up the
in london and was a great novelty at the time  these arc lamps and designs similar to it  powered by large magnetos  were first installed on english lighthouses in the mid 1850s  but the power limitations prevented these models from being a proper success 
the first successful
was developed by russian engineer   and used the   its advantage lay in the fact that it didn t require the use of a mechanical regulator like its predecessors  it was first exhibited at the
and was heavily promoted by gramme  the
was installed along the half mile length of   place du theatre francais and around the
in 1878 
british engineer
developed a more sophisticated design in 1878 which gave a much brighter and steadier light than the yablochkov candle in 1878  he formed crompton   co  and began to manufacture  sell and install the crompton lamp  his concern was one of the first electrical engineering firms in the world 
incandescent light bulbs  
various forms of
had numerous inventors  however  the most successful early bulbs were those that used a carbon filament sealed in a high vacuum  these were invented by
in 1878 in britain and by
in 1879 in the us  edisons lamp was more successful than swans because edison used a thinner filament  giving it higher resistance and thus conducting much less current  edison began commercial production of carbon filament bulbs in 1880  swan s light began commercial production in 1881 
swan s house  in   gateshead  was the world s first to have working light bulbs installed  the lit   phil library in   was the first public room lit by electric light  and the
was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electricity 
central power stations and isolated systems  
the first central station providing public power is believed to be one at   surrey  u k  autumn 1881  the system was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company  so the town council decided to use electricity  the system lit up arc lamps on the main streets and incandescent lamps on a few side streets with hydroelectric power  by 1882 between 8 and 10 households were connected  with a total of 57 lights  the system was not a commercial success and the town reverted to gas 
the first large scale central distribution supply plant was opened at
in london in 1882  equipped with 1000 incandescent lightbulbs that replaced the older gas lighting  the station lit up holborn circus including the offices of the
and the famous   the supply was a direct current at 110v  due to power loss in the copper wires  this amounted to 100v for the customer 
within weeks  a parliamentary committee recommended passage of the landmark 1882 electric lighting act  which allowed the licensing of persons  companies or local authorities to supply electricity for any public or private purposes 
the first large scale central power station in america was edison s
in new york  which began operating in september 1882  the station had six 200 horsepower edison dynamos  each powered by a separate steam engine  it was located in a business and commercial district and supplied 110 volt direct current to 85 customers with 400 lamps  by 1884 pearl street was supplying 508 customers with 10,164 lamps 
by the mid-1880s  other electric companies were establishing central power stations and distributing electricity  including
and the
in the uk 
and
in the us and
in   by 1890 there were 1000 central stations in operation  the 1902 census listed 3,620 central stations  by 1925 half of power was provided by central stations 
load factor   isolated systems  
one of the biggest problems facing the early power companies was the hourly variable demand  when lighting was practically the only use of electricity  demand was high during the first hours before the workday and the evening hours when demand peaked  as a consequence  most early electric companies did not provide daytime service  with two-thirds providing no daytime service in 1897 
the ratio of the average load to the peak load of a central station is called the load factor  for electric companies to increase profitability and lower rates  it was necessary to increase the load factor  the way this was eventually accomplished was through motor load  motors are used more during daytime and many run continuously   see     electric street railways were ideal for load balancing  many electric railways generated their own power and also sold power and operated distribution systems 
the load factor adjusted upward by the turn of the 20th centuryat
the load factor increased from 19.3  in 1884 to 29.4  in 1908  by 1929  the load factor around the world was greater than 50   mainly due to motor load 
before widespread power distribution from central stations  many factories  large hotels  apartment and office buildings had their own power generation  often this was economically attractive because the exhaust steam could be used for building and industrial process heat  which today is known as
or combined heat and power  chp   most self-generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell  as late as the early 20th century  isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations 
is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power  such as pulp and paper  chemicals and refining  the continued use of private electric generators is called  
direct current electric motors  
main articles 
and
the first commutator dc electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the british scientist
in 1832  the crucial advance that this represented over the motor demonstrated by
was the incorporation of a   this allowed sturgeon s motor to be the first capable of providing continuous rotary motion 
improved on the
in 1884 by solving the problem of maintaining a constant speed with varying load and reducing sparking from the brushes  sprague sold his motor through edison co  it is easy to vary speed with dc motors  which made them suited for a number of applications such as electric street railways  machine tools and certain other industrial applications where speed control was desirable 
alternating current

although the first power stations supplied   the distribution of
soon became the most favored option  the main advantages of ac were that it could be transformed to high voltage to reduce transmission losses and that ac motors could easily run at constant speeds 
technology was rooted in
1830-31 discovery that a changing

the first person to conceive of a rotating magnetic field was walter baily who gave a workable demonstration of his battery-operated
motor aided by a
on june 28  1879 to the physical society of london  nearly identical to bailys apparatus  french electrical engineer
in 1880 published a paper that identified the rotating magnetic field principle and that of a two-phase ac system of currents to produce it  in 1886  english engineer
built an ac motor by expanding upon the induction-repulsion principle and his  
it was in the 1880s that the technology was commercially developed for large scale electricity generation and transmission  in 1882 the british inventor and
  working for the company
collaborated with the distinguished physicist
to pioneer ac power technology including an early transformer 
a
developed by
and
was demonstrated in london in 1881  and attracted the interest of   they also exhibited the invention in
in 1884  where it was adopted for an electric lighting system  many of their designs were adapted to the particular laws governing electrical distribution in the uk   
went into this business in 1882 when he set up a shop in london designing various electrical devices  ferranti believed in the success of alternating current power distribution early on  and was one of the few experts in this system in the uk  with the help of   ferranti pioneered the first ac power generator and
in 1882    a
  invented the three-wire    system for the distribution of electrical power  for which he was granted a
in 1882 
the italian inventor
invented a polyphase ac
in 1885  the idea was that two out-of-phase  but synchronized  currents might be used to produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts  other inventors were the american engineers charles s  bradley and   and the german technician   they were able to overcome the problem of starting up the ac motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current 
introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890  a much more capable design that became the prototype used in europe and the u s  by 1895 ge and westinghouse both had ac motors on the market  with single phase current either a capacitor or coil  creating inductance  can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field  multi-speed ac motors that have separately wired poles have long been available  the most common being two speed  speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off  which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors  or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors 
ac power stations  
the first ac power station in the world was built by the english
  in 1887 the london electric supply corporation hired ferranti for the design of their power station at   he designed the building  the generating plant and the distribution system  it was built at the stowage  a site to the west of the mouth of
once used by the   built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage  10,000v  ac current  it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central london  on its completion in 1891 it was the first truly modern power station  supplying high-voltage ac power that was then  stepped down  with transformers for consumer use on each street  this basic system remains in use today around the world 
in america 
who had become interested in the power transformer developed by gaulard and gibbs  began to develop his ac lighting system  using a transmission system with a 20 1 step up voltage with step-down  in 1890 westinghouse and stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in colorado  a decision was taken to use ac for power transmission from the niagara power project to buffalo  new york  proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included dc and compressed air systems  a combination dc and compressed air system remained under consideration until late in the schedule  despite the protestations of the niagara commissioner
 lord kelvin  the decision was taken to build an ac system  which had been proposed by both westinghouse and general electric  in october 1893 westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000hp  250 rpm  25hz  two phase generators 
by the 1890s  single and poly-phase ac was undergoing rapid introduction  in the u s  by 1902  61  of generating capacity was ac  increasing to 95  in 1917  despite the superiority of alternating current for most applications  a few existing dc systems continued to operate for several decades after ac became the standard for new systems

steam turbines  
main article 
the efficiency of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work was a critical factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations  early projects used reciprocating   operating at relatively low speeds  the introduction of the
fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations  steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines  and generally had higher efficiency  the speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution  making parallel operation of ac generators feasible  and improved the stability of rotary converters for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses  steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines  not being limited by the allowable speed of a piston in a cylinder  this made them more compatible with ac generators with only two or four poles  no gearbox or belted speed increaser was needed between the engine and the generator  it was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service 
the modern
was invented in 1884 by the british   whose first model was connected to a
that generated 7.5kw  10hp  of electricity  the invention of parson s steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible 
were widely introduced in english central stations by 1894  the first electric supply company in the world to generate electricity using
was parsons  own electricity supply company   set up in 1894  within parson s lifetime  the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times 
an 1899
linked directly to a dynamo
the first u s  turbines were two de leval units at edison co  in new york in 1895  the first u s  parsons turbine was at
near  
steam turbines also had capital cost and operating advantages over reciprocating engines  the condensate from steam engines was contaminated with oil and could not be reused  while condensate from a turbine is clean and typically reused  steam turbines were a fraction of the size and weight of comparably rated reciprocating steam engine  steam turbines can operate for years with almost no wear  reciprocating steam engines required high maintenance  steam turbines can be manufactured with capacities far larger than any steam engines ever made  giving important  
steam turbines could be built to operate on higher pressure and temperature steam  a fundamental principle of
is that the higher the temperature of the steam entering an engine  the higher the efficiency  the introduction of steam turbines motivated a series of improvements in temperatures and pressures  the resulting increased conversion efficiency lowered electricity prices 
the power density of boilers was increased by using forced combustion air and by using compressed air to feed pulverized coal  also  coal handling was mechanized and automated 
electrical grid  
main article 
with the realization of long distance power transmission it was possible to interconnect different central stations to balance loads and improve load factors  interconnection became increasingly desirable as electrification grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century 
  of the
consulting partnership  built the
near
in 1901  and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in europe  in 1905 he tried to influence parliament to unify the variety of voltages and frequencies in the country s electricity supply industry  but it was not until
that parliament began to take this idea seriously  appointing him head of a parliamentary committee to address the problem  in 1916 merz pointed out that the uk could use its small size to its advantage  by creating a dense distribution grid to feed its industries efficiently  his findings led to the
of 1918  which in turn created the electricity supply bill of 1919  the bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system in the uk 
the more significant electricity  supply  act of 1926  lead to the setting up of the national grid  the
standardised the nation s
and established the first synchronised ac grid  running at 132
and 50   this started operating as a national system  the   in 1938 
in the united states it became a national objective after the power crisis during the summer of 1918 in the midst of world war i to consolidate supply  in 1934 the
recognized electric utilities as
of importance along with gas  water  and telephone companies and thereby were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations 
most studies of electrification and electric grids focused on industrial core countries in europe and the united states  elsewhere  wired electricity was often carried on and through the circuits of colonial rule  some historians and sociologists considered the interplay of colonial politics and the development of electric grids  in india  rao
showed that linguistics-based regional politics  not techno-geographical considerations  led to the creation of two separate grids  in colonial zimbabwe  rhodesia   chikowero
showed that electrification was racially based and served the white settler community while excluding africans  and in mandate palestine  shamir
showed that british electric concessions to a zionist-owned company deepened the economic disparities between arabs and jews 
household electrification  
the electrification of households in europe and north america began in the early 20th century in major cities and in areas served by electric railways and increased rapidly until about 1930 when 70  of households were electrified in the u s 
rural areas were electrified first in europe  and in the us the   established in 1935 brought electrification to rural areas 
historical cost of electricity  
central station electric power generating provided power more efficiently and at lower cost than small generators  the capital and operating cost per unit of power were also cheaper with central stations  the cost of electricity fell dramatically in the first decades of the twentieth century due to the introduction of
and the improved load factor after the introduction of ac motors  as electricity prices fell  usage increased dramatically and central stations were scaled up to enormous sizes  creating significant economies of scale  for the historical cost see ayres-warr  2002  fig  7 
benefits of electrification  
benefits of electric lighting  
electric lighting was highly desirable  the light was much brighter than oil or gas lamps  and there was no soot  although early electricity was very expensive compared to today  it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil or gas lighting  electric lighting was so much safer than oil or gas that some companies were able to pay for the electricity with the insurance savings 
pre-electric power  
main article 
 one of the inventions most important to a class of highly skilled workers  engineers  would be a small motive power - ranging perhaps from the force of from half a man to that of two horses  which might commence as well as cease its action at a moment s notice  require no expense of time for its management and be of modest cost both in original cost and in daily expense   charles babbage  1851
to be efficient steam engines needed to be several hundred horsepower  steam engines and boilers also required operators and maintenance  for these reasons the smallest commercial steam engines were about 2 horsepower  this was above the need for many small shops  also  a small steam engine and boiler cost about  7,000 while an old blind horse that could develop 1/2 horsepower cost  20 or less  machinery to use horses for power cost  300 or less 
threshing machine in 1881 
many power requirements were less than that of a horse  shop machines  such as woodworking lathes  were often powered with a one- or two-man crank  household sewing machines were powered with a foot treadle  however  factory sewing machines were steam-powered from a   dogs were sometimes used on machines such as a treadmill  which could be adapted to churn butter 
in the late 19th century specially designed power buildings leased space to small shops  these building supplied power to the tenants from a steam engine through  
electric motors were several times more efficient than small steam engines because central station generation was more efficient than small steam engines and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses 
electric motors were more efficient than human or animal power  the conversion efficiency for animal feed to work is between 4 and 5  compared to over 30  for electricity generated using coal 
economic impact of electrification  
main article 
from 1870-80 each man-hour was provided with  55hp  in 1950 each man-hour was provided with 5hp  or a 3  annual increase  declining to 1.5  from 1930-50 
the period of electrification of factories and households from 1900 to 1940  was one of high
and economic growth  in economics  the efficiency of electrical generation has been shown to correlate with technological progress 
power sources for generation of electricity  
main article 
most electricity is generated by
or steam plants  the majority of which are
that burn coal  natural gas  fuel oil or bio-fuels  such as wood waste and black liquor from chemical pulping 
the most efficient thermal system is
in which a
powers a generator using the high temperature combustion gases and then exhausts the cooler combustion gases to generate low pressure steam for conventional steam cycle generation

hydroelectric power plant  the   began operating september 30  1882  in   with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts 
wind turbines  
the first electricity-generating
was a battery charging machine installed in july 1887 by scottish academic
to light his holiday home in   scotland  some months later american inventor
built the first automatically operated wind turbine for electricity production in   advances in recent decades greatly lowered the cost of wind power making it one of the most competitive alternate energies and competitive with higher priced natural gas  before shale gas   wind energy s main problem is that it is intermittent and therefore needs grid extensions and energy storage to be a reliable main energy source 
geothermal energy  
prince piero ginori conti tested the first
power generator on 4 july 1904 in   italy  it successfully lit four light bulbs  later  in 1911  the world s first commercial geothermal power plant was built there  italy was the world s only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958  geothermal requires very hot underground temperatures near the surface to generate steam which is used in a low temperature steam plant  geothermal power is only used in a few areas  italy supplies all of the electrified rail network with geothermal power

current extent of electrification  
while electrification of cities and homes has existed since the late 19th century even today about 1.3 billion people lack electricity  mostly in
and the   one estimate  2010  suggests that as many as half of  s households lack electricity 
most recent progress in electrification took place between the 1950s and 1980s  vast gains were seen in the 1970s and 1980s - from 49 percent of the world s population in 1970 to 76 percent in 1990  recent gains have been more modest - by the early 2010s 81 to 83 percent of the world s population had access to electricity

energy resilience  
main article 
electricity is 
the  form of energy  it stays in the continent where it is produced 
multi-sourced  if one source suffers a shortage  electricity can be produced from another  including  
as a result  it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience and the energy system is going to electrification
