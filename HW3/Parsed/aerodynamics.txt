history  
main article 
modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century  but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills  and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history  such as the
legend of
and   fundamental concepts of     and
appear in the work of
and  
in 1726 
became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance  making him one of the first aerodynamicists  -
followed in 1738 with hydrodynamica in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure  density  and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as   which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift  in 1757 
published the more general
which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows  the euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s  resulting in the   the navier-stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and are difficult to solve 
a replica of the  
is on display at the virginia air and space center  wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of the laws of aerodynamics 
in 1799 
became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight        and    as well as the relationships between them  outlining the work towards achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century  in 1871 
constructed the first   allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces  drag theories were developed by     and   in 1889    a french aeronautical engineer  became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight    the first person to become highly successful with glider flights  was also the first to propose thin  curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag  building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel  the

during the time of the first flights      and
independently created theories that connected
of a fluid flow to lift  kutta and zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory  expanding upon the work of lanchester 
is credited with developing the mathematics behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with  
as aircraft speed increased  designers began to encounter challenges associated with air
at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound  the differences in air flows under these conditions led to problems in aircraft control  increased drag due to   and structural dangers due to   the ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the
after
who was one of the first to investigate the properties of
flow 
and
independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a   while
led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils 
and
introduced the term
to describe flow speeds around mach 1 where drag increases rapidly  this rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the sound barrier was broken for the first time in 1947 using the
aircraft 
by the time the sound barrier was broken  much of the subsonic and low supersonic aerodynamics knowledge had matured  the
fueled an ever evolving line of high performance aircraft 
began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using a computer  with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions  knowledge of
and
aerodynamics has also matured since the 1960s  and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow  designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions  as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems  continues to fuel new research in aerodynamics  while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the navier-stokes equations 
fundamental concepts  
forces of flight on an
understanding the motion of air around an object  often called a flow field  enables the calculation of forces and
acting on the object  in many aerodynamics problems  the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight        and   of these  lift and drag are aerodynamic forces  i e  forces due to air flow over a solid body  calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum  continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as       and   which may be functions of spatial position and time  these properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated from equations for the conservation of mass    and energy in air flows  density  flow velocity  and an additional property    are used to classify flow fields 
flow classification  
flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime  subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound  transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound  supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere  a fourth classification  hypersonic flow  refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound  aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow 
refers to whether or not the flow in a problem can have a varying density  subsonic flows are often assumed to be incompressible  i e  the density is assumed to be constant  transonic and supersonic flows are compressible  and neglecting the changes in density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results when performing calculations 
viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow  in some flow fields  viscous effects are very small  and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects  these approximations are called inviscid flows  flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows  finally  aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment  external aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes  e g  around an airplane wing   while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects  e g  through a jet engine  
continuum assumption  
unlike liquids and solids  gases are composed of discrete
which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas  on a molecular level  flow fields are made up of many individual collisions between gas molecules and between gas molecules and solid surfaces  however  in most aerodynamics applications  the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored  and the flow field is assumed to behave as a   this assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow 
validity of the continuum assumption is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question  for the continuum assumption to be valid  the
length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question  for example  many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions  where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers  in these cases  the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters  which is much larger than the mean free path length  for these applications  the continuum assumption is reasonable  the continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows  such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes  e g  300,000ft 90km  or satellites in   in these cases 
is a more accurate method of solving the problem than continuous aerodynamics  the
can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics 
conservation laws  
aerodynamic problems are typically solved using
as applied to a   three conservation principles are used 
  in fluid dynamics  the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the   which requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest 
  in fluid dynamics  the mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of   momentum within a flow of interest is only created or destroyed due to the work of external forces  which may include both   such as viscous    forces  and   such as   the momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a single
equation or a set of three
equations  derived from the components of the three-dimensional flow velocity vector  in its most complete form  the momentum conservation equations are known as the   the navier-stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using   because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations  simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications  the
are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces used widely by modern aerodynamicists in cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small  additionally 
is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow  neglecting gravity 
  the energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow  and that any addition or subtraction of energy is due either to the fluid flow in and out of the region of interest    or  
the
or another
is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system to solve for unknown variables 
branches of aerodynamics  
aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow  including     and   external aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes  evaluating the
and
on an
or the
that form in front of the nose of a
are examples of external aerodynamics  internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects  for instance  internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a
or through an
pipe 
aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the
is below  near or above the   a problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound 
if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present  normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound  
when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound  and
when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound  aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow  a rough definition considers flows with
above 5 to be hypersonic 
the influence of
in the flow dictates a third classification  some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects on the solution  in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible  the approximations to these problems are called   flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows 
incompressible aerodynamics  
further information 
an incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space  although all real fluids are compressible  a flow problem is often considered incompressible if the effect of the density changes in the problem on the outputs of interest is small  this is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound  effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound  the
is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed or the flow must be solved as compressible 
subsonic flow  
subsonic  or low-speed  aerodynamics studies fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow  there are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is  
and   this case is called
and allows the
used to be a simplified version of the governing equations of   thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions 
in solving a subsonic problem  one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility  compressibility is a description of the amount of change of
in the problem  when the effects of compressibility on the solution are small  the aerodynamicist may choose to assume that density is constant  the problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem  when the density is allowed to vary  the problem is called a compressible problem  in air  compressibility effects are usually ignored when the
in the flow does not exceed 0.3  about 335 feet  102m  per second or 228 miles  366km  per hour at 60f  16c    above 0.3  the problem should be solved by using compressible aerodynamics 
compressible aerodynamics  
main article 
according to the theory of aerodynamics  a flow is considered to be compressible if its change in
with respect to
is non-zero along a   this means that  unlike incompressible flow  changes in density must be considered  in general  this is the case where the
in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3  the mach  3 value is rather arbitrary  but it is used because gas flows with a mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density with respect to the change in pressure of less than 5   furthermore  that maximum 5  density change occurs at the
of an object immersed in the gas flow and the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower  transonic  supersonic  and hypersonic flows are all compressible 
transonic flow  
main article 
the term transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local
 generally taken as
0.81.2   it is defined as the range of speeds between the   when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become   and a higher speed  typically near   when all of the airflow is supersonic  between these speeds  some of the airflow is supersonic  while some of the airflow is not supersonic 
supersonic flow  
main article 
supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound  calculating the lift on the
during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem 
supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow  fluids react to differences in pressure  pressure changes are how a fluid is  told  to respond to its environment  therefore  since
is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid  the
in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that  information  can travel in the flow  this difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object  in front of that object  the fluid builds up a
as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest  in fluid traveling at subsonic speed  this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream  changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid  knows  the object is there and is avoiding it  however  in a supersonic flow  the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream  thus  when the fluid finally does strike the object  it is forced to change its properties        and in an extremely violent and
fashion called a   the presence of shock waves  along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity  see   fluids  is the central difference between supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics problems 
hypersonic flow  
main article 
in aerodynamics  hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic  in the 1970s  the term generally came to refer to speeds of mach 5  5 times the speed of sound  and above  the hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime  hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave  viscous interaction  and chemical dissociation of gas

loads in the design of large buildings and   urban aerodynamics seeks to help
and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces  create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution  the field of environmental aerodynamics studies the ways
and flight mechanics affect ecosystems  the aerodynamics of internal passages is important in     and in
