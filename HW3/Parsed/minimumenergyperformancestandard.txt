a meps  minimum energy performance standard  is a specification  containing a number of performance requirements for an -using device  that effectively limits the maximum amount of energy that may be consumed by a product in performing a specified task 
a meps is usually made mandatory by a government energy efficiency body  it may include requirements not directly related to energy  this is to ensure that general performance and user satisfaction are not adversely affected by increasing energy efficiency 
a meps generally requires use of a particular test procedure that specifies how performance is measured 
in
when addressing energy efficiency  a meps is sometimes referred to simply as a standard  as in co-operation on   in
when addressing energy efficiency  meps are sometimes referred to as normas  translated as  norms

a
is required to maintain
inside its compartments within specified limits  and to operate  including defrosting  in a specified ambient temperature while using at most a specified amount of   the energy use allowed varies according to volume  number of doors  the function of the various compartments and other parameters  this graph shows the dramatic reduction in electricity use in u s  refrigerators following the introduction of a series of first california then u s  meps starting in the mid-1970s 
price  volume and efficiency of refrigerators
an
is required to shift air at a specified rate while consuming a limited amount of power 
a storage
providing hot water for sanitary purposes is required to heat up a specified quantity of water to a specified temperature and store it at that temperature for a specified time while consuming a limited amount of energy  in this example  the requirements for heating up and for maintaining the temperature may be applied as two separate energy performance requirements or there may be a single task efficiency 
an electric
is required to have a specified minimum full-load efficiency 
a
is required to start and run up to near full
in a given time  to have a minimum life of several thousand hours  to maintain its output within specified limits  to withstand a certain number of switchings  to have a consistent colour appearance and a specified colour rendering  its energy performance requirement is usually stated in terms of minimum efficacy  light output per electrical input  
california  
in the u s   the state of
was a pioneer
in the introduction of meps  in order to reduce the growth in electricity use  the
 cec  was given unique and strong authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances sold in the state  it started to adopt appliance efficiency regulations in 1978  and has updated the standards regularly over time  and expanded the list of covered appliances 
in 1988  california s standards became national standards for the u s  through the enactment of the
 naeca   the federal standards preempted state standards  unless the state justified a waiver from federal preemption based on conditions in the state   and since then  the u s  department of energy has had the responsibility to update the federal standards 
california has continued to expand the list of appliances it regulates for appliances that are not federally regulated  and therefore not preempted  in recent years    the cec s attention has been focused on consumer electronics  for which energy use has been growing dramatically 
australia  
meps programs are made mandatory in
by state government legislation and regulations which give force to the relevant australian standards  it is mandatory for the following products manufactured in or imported into australia to meet the meps levels specified by the relevant australian standards

a law was approved in 2001  meps have been set for three-phase electric motors and  
new zealand  
on 5 february 2002 
introduced minimum energy performance standards  meps  with energy efficiency regulations  meps and energy rating labels help improve the energy efficiency of our   products  and enable consumers to choose products that use less energy  products covered by meps must meet or exceed set levels for energy performance before they can be sold to consumers  meps have been updated over the years  2002  2003  2004  2008  2011  to cover a wide range of products  and increasing levels of stringency 
works with australia to harmonise meps levels  almost all of its standards are joint standards with australia  new zealand has mandatory energy rating labelling for dishwashers and clothes dryers  fridges  washing machines and room air conditioners  meps apply to the following 
refrigerators and freezers
washing machines
air conditioners
computer room air conditioners
chillers
electric water storage heaters
gas water heaters
external power supplies
set-top boxes
distribution transformers
refrigerated display cabinets
three-phase electric motors
ballasts for fluorescent lamps
tubular fluorescent lamps
