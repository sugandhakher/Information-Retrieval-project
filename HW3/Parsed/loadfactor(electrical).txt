the load factor is defined as the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period

typical example of a large commercial electrical bill  kw demand   436 kw  kwh use   57,200 kwh  number of days in billing cycle   30d
load factor         57,200 kwh    30 days x 24 hours per day x 436 kw   x 100    18.22 
it can be derived from the
of the specific device or system of devices  its value is always less than one because maximum demand is always higher than average demand  since facilities likely never operate at full capacity for the duration of an entire 24-hour day  a high load factor means power usage is relatively constant  low load factor shows that occasionally a high demand is set  to service that peak  capacity is sitting idle for long periods  thereby imposing higher costs on the system  electrical rates are designed so that customers with high load factor are charged less overall per kwh  this process along with others is called
or peak shaving 
the load factor is closely related to and often confused with the

maximum load in given time period
maximum possible load
  displaystyle f  demand    frac   text maximum load in given time period    text maximum possible load    
the major difference to note is that the denominator in the demand factor is fixed depending on the system  because of this  the demand factor cannot be derived from the load profile but needs the addition of the full load of the system in question
