window film is a thin film or laminate that can be installed to the interior of glass surfaces in    
and buildings  it is usually made from
due to its clarity  tensile strength  dimensional stability  and ability to accept a variety of surface-applied or embedded treatments 
window film can be generically described by the components it contains for performance and or aesthetics  i e  dyed  metallized  ceramic - or by its intended use  uses can be roughly divided into automotive marine where surfaces are often curved  and architectural where flat glass is usual  window film is normally applied by professional service companies but there are also d i y  kits widely available 
the international window film association  founded in 1991  provides unbranded information about window films

there are many different grades  shades  colours  and thicknesses of available window films built to offer solutions to a variety of challenges  window films are a retrofit upgrade for existing glass that can be used to address problems inherent to glazing  including 
heat and glare reduction
thermal insulation
uv filtration
safety and security
privacy
decoration  signage and branding

window films are an extremely cost-effective method to reduce heating and cooling costs in existing buildings by reducing the amount of heat transfer through glazing 
primary properties  
the colorful film on these windows gives the building a unique appearance while providing privacy and insulation from the sun 
heat rejection films are normally applied to the interior of flat glass windows to reduce the amount of     and
 uv 
entering windows  such films are usually dyed or metalized  which can be transparent to visible light  to convert incoming
to infrared radiation  which is then rejected back through the glass to the exterior  modern window film technology has created ceramic window films which are non-metallic and do not contain dyes that can result in discoloration  the ceramic and metallic window films usually cost 1015 percent more than regular window film but can reduce energy transmission by as much as 80 percent  ceramic window films cost slightly more but provide a substantial increase in blocking uv rays and ability to control heat transfer 
to keep the sun s heat out of the house  a low-emissivity coating should be applied to the outside pane of   if the windows are designed to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house  typical of cold climates   the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of glazed windows  such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window  and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room  silvered film may also be employed to the same end  spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun s infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light 
security films are applied to glass so when the glass is broken it holds together  preventing dangerous shards from flying about  or to make it more difficult for an intruder to gain entry  typically applied to commercial glass  these films are made of heavy-gauge plastic and are intended to maintain the integrity of glass when subject to heavy   the most robust security films are capable of preventing fragmentation and the production of hazardous glass
from forces such as
blasts  some companies have even experimented with bullet ballistics and multiple layers of security film  another key application for security window films  safety window films  is on large areas of  flat glass  such as storefront windows  sliding glass doors  and larger windows that are prone to hurricane damage  these security films  if applied properly  can also provide protection for vehicles    these security films are often tinted and can be up to 400
 m  thick  compared to less than 50m for ordinary tint films  if anchored correctly  they can also provide protection for architectural glazing in the event of an explosion  a layer of film  of 100m thickness or greater  can prevent the ejection of
when a projectile impacts on its surface  which otherwise creates small dagger-like shards of glass that can cause injury 
switchable films can be switched from opaque to clear by a safe voltage under 36v ac  in its opaque state  it can be perfectly used as a projection screen that is viewable from both sides  3g switchable film also has uv  100   and ir  94   blocking functions and security function 
graphic design films are generally colored vinyl or frosted  frosted finish films closely resemble
or
glass  while vinyl films are available in a range of colors  both types of films are commonly used in commercial applications 
privacy films reduce visibility through the glass  privacy film for flat-glass commercial and residential applications may be silvered  offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side  it may also be frosted  rendering the window
but not transparent  privacy films for automobiles are available in
of darkness  with the darker tints commonly known as  limo tint  
correctly applied mirror film can create   note that in order to be effective the light differential must be from 6 to 10 times greater to maintain the intended performance  for example  the buildings in a city  during the daytime are difficult to see into  at night however  they can be seen in with ease and if a light is on in the interior space it is easily seen along with the contents 
other benefits include protection for passengers in the rear of automobiles  protection from uv rays  which have some    cooling for pets  greater   reduced chance of theft  because valuables are less visible   reduced
and
on
 lcd  screens  and protection for those who have conditions involving
or skin sensitivity  such as
 sle   window film is also considered more effective and practical than stick-on blinds 
uv filtering to reduce fading  
protection from uv light can be accomplished by film that addresses only the uv spectrum  as uv is one of the main sources of fading  it can prolong the life of fixtures and fittings  basic colorless clear films reject  absorbs  some uv radiation up to 380nm  and depending on the manufacturer  uv inhibitors are added to the polyester  with specialist films offering protection to 400nm    tinted films are necessary for protection to 500nm   
window films filter out over 99  of uv rays to 380nm  reducing the main factor in fading  however  additional factors such as solar heat  visible light  humidity  and presence or absence of chemical vapors also contribute to fading  therefore  the greatest protection from fading is offered by tinted or metallised window films that reject large levels of heat and visible light  in addition to uv 
selection of window film  
not all films are suitable for all glass  the absorptance of the glass and the film  the size of the pane  the thickness of the glass  the construction of the window should be considered in terms of single pane  insulated glass  treated  with a low-emissivity coating   laminated or toughened 
advice on the appropriate selection of film for the glass is vital to ensure that the glass does not crack as a result of thermal stress  however  it is possible that a pane of glass may break subsequent to the application of an appropriate film  because the pane has been damaged during the glazing of the window  or as a result of movement of the building or other physical stresses that are not apparent at the time of the application of the film 
glass may crack subsequent to the application of sign writing or if heavy  thermally efficient drapes are hung close to the glass  particularly if the edges of the glass are damaged 
the chances of glass breakage occurring subsequent to the application of film or sign writing or the hanging of drapes  are very small  however breakage can occur and it is impossible to predict the edge condition of the glass without removing it from the frame  an approach that is not practical 
thermal properties  
systems have energy costs  and window films can used to increase   modern windows with
glass do not need retrofit films  but since most of the existing windows do not have a low   window films make a lot of sense as a retrofit energy improvement  they can provide thermal comfort and are one of the most cost-competitive and environmentally-friendly energy improvements  especially in hot and mixed climates 
unintended features  
under certain conditions  window film will exhibit   this phenomenon usually occurs at night  when the source of illumination within a building is fluorescent lighting  the amount of iridescence may vary from almost imperceptible to very visible  it most frequently occurs when the film is constructed with scratch resistance protection  when iridescence does occur in window film  the best way to stop it is to prevent the fluorescent light from illuminating the film or to use an alternative type of light 
building use  
window tints can be used in applications like shopfronts windows  office block windows  and house windows  this is often done to increase privacy  and decrease heating and cooling costs  window tints are used in some  
window films are also used to apply
to glass and other transparent surfaces  to provide advertising  branding  signage and decoration  see-through graphics are most commonly applied using a perforated window film with a graphic visible from one side but not the other side  which remains see-though 
on buses are perhaps the widest application of see-through graphics 
certification and standards  
the thicker window films known as
are designed to perform under extreme conditions  and as such there are specific standard criteria these films should meet  such as american standards
z 97 
16 cfr 1201  cat ii  400ft-lb   and the
bs 6206  class a  b  c   the
offer the en12600 standard classification of resistance of glazing to impact  often  building codes dictate that a film must have a report verifying that it has met at least one of these standards 
solar window film is usually subject to less critical testing  however  standards are in place to maintain a level of quality in the industry  the ansi standards astm e903 and astm d1044-93 relate to the solar uv transmission properties and abrasion resistance  respectively  the larger window film manufacturers use these standards to guarantee the quality of their raw materials and finished products 
regulations for automotive use  
window tint on a
in america  tint on the front window is lighter than on the back window because of window tint laws

automobile window tinting reduces the  visible light transmission   vlt  through car windows  this can be problematic at night  or when
must be able to see through the windows of other vehicles in order to spot hazards  police also may want to be able to identify the passengers in a vehicle  therefore  in many   there are laws to restrict the darkness of tinting 
factory tint  
 factory tint   done at the time of manufacture is generally not an applied film  but instead is done by dying the inside of the glass with a darkened pigment  an electrical process known as  deep dipping   the pigment gives the glass a tint  but doesn t provide uv ray protection or heat rejection like most window films do  the average vlt of factory tint is between 15 -26  
regulation by country  
in the u s  
has different limits of allowable tint as measured on the front side window  these range from a low vlt of 24  in washington  to 88  in california  with less stringent restriction being common for windows in the rear of the vehicle  full details of glazing and sticker laws can be found at the
website 
in canada  automobile tinting laws are set at the  
in the united kingdom  regulations set forth by the
under the
provide that all front windows in front of the b post can have no less than 70 percent vlt  windscreens are only allowed tinting outside the sweep of the windscreen wipers to a maximum of six inches from the top of the windscreen 
are increasingly cracking down on illegal tinting on vehicles although window tints are not checked on the annual mot test 
in   window tinting limits are specified in gost 5727-88  the limit is 75  for the front windshield  a darker stripe no wider than 10cm is allowed at the very top  and 70  for the front side windows  tinting of back windows is not regulated  in practice  however 
are often used to pass inspection or avoid road police tickets even with illegal tint 
in   any kind of window tint is illegal  an exception is made for factory tint in vehicles purchased before 1 april 2006  also exempt are vehicles of cash collectors  kgb and certain officials 
in   window tinting is permitted on rear windows and rear windshield only  with no limits on films graduation  a professional installer certificate is also required  and it s necessary to keep visible the film s brand and homologation number on the windows 
in   australia  the
permits vlt of 35  on all windows  tint on the windscreen  a band across the top is permitted with a depth of no more than 10  of the depth of the windscreen  an exception to the side   rear window tinting regulations applies to cars tinted before 1 august 1994 
in   the
stipulates that private motor vehicles must have at least 35  vlt after film has been applied  side and rear windows  including the windows next to the driver  are allowed full coverage  the front windshield may have an anti-glare band no lower than the extended sun visors  there is no concise regulation for a sunroof  there is an exception for factory tinted glass  which may be any vlt level  also  commercial goods vehicles are allowed any level of vlt on windows behind the driver  provided the driver has adequate rear vision via side mirrors 
in   the malta transport authority permits vlt of 70  on front side windows  tint on the windscreen  a band across the top is permitted with a depth of no more than 100mm of the depth of the windscreen  30  on the rear and side windows 
in   the rules governing tinted glass are defined in   which states that the front and rear windshield should be 70  vlt and all other windows are limited at 50  vlt  on 27 april 2012  the
ordered all black films to be removed
