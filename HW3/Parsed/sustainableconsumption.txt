the oslo definition  
the definition proposed by the 1994 oslo symposium on sustainable consumption defines it as  the use of services and related products which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations  
strong and weak sustainable consumption  
in order to achieve sustainable consumption  two developments have to take place  it requires both an increase in the efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries  the first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak sustainable consumption  here  technological improvements and eco-efficiency support a necessary reduction in resource consumption  once this aim has been met  the second prerequisite  the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable  strong sustainable consumption approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of well-being and assess the need for changes based on a risk-averse perspective  in order to achieve what can be termed strong sustainable consumption  changes in infrastructures as well as the choices customers have are required  in the political arena  weak sustainable consumption has been discussed whereas strong sustainable consumption is missing from all debates 
taking into consideration those two approaches to sustainable consumption  it is evident that individual consumers play a key role  a huge problem is the existence of a so-called attitude-behaviour or values-action gap  i e  many consumers are well aware of the importance of their consumption choices and care about environmental issues  however  most of them do not translate their concerns into their consumption patterns as the purchase-decision making process is highly complicated and relies on e g  social  political and psychological factors  young et al  identified a lack of time for research  high prices  a lack of information and the cognitive effort needed as the main barriers when it comes to green consumption choices
