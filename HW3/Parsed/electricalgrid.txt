general layout of electricity networks  voltages and depictions of electrical lines are typical for germany and other european systems 
an electrical grid is an interconnected network for delivering
from suppliers to consumers  it consists of generating stations that produce electrical power  high-voltage transmission lines that carry power from distant sources to demand centers  and distribution lines that connect individual customers 
may be located near a fuel source  at a dam site  or to take advantage of renewable energy sources  and are often located away from heavily populated areas  they are usually quite large to take advantage of the   the electric power which is generated is stepped up to a higher voltage at which it connects to the
network 
the bulk power transmission network will move the power long distances  sometimes across international boundaries  until it reaches its wholesale customer  usually the company that owns the local
network  
on arrival at a substation  the power will be stepped down from a transmission level voltage to a distribution level voltage  as it exits the substation  it enters the distribution wiring  finally  upon arrival at the service location  the power is stepped down again from the distribution voltage to the required service voltage s

history  
early electric energy was produced near the device or service requiring that energy  in the 1880s  electricity competed with steam  hydraulics  and especially   coal gas was first produced on customers premises but later evolved into
plants that enjoyed   in the industrialized world cities had networks of piped gas  used for lighting  but gas lamps produced poor light  wasted heat  made rooms hot and smoky  and gave off
and   in the 1880s electric lighting soon became advantageous compared to gas lighting 
companies took advantage of economies of scale and moved to centralized power generation  distribution  and system management  with long distance power transmission it became possible to interconnect stations to balance loads and improve load factors

standardized the nation s electricity supply and established the first synchronized ac grid  running at 132 kilo volts and 50   this started operating as a national system  the   in 1938 
in the united states in the 1920s  utilities formed joint-operations to share peak load coverage and backup power  in 1934  with the passage of the
 usa   electric utilities were recognized as
of importance and were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations  the
required transmission line owners to allow electric generation companies open access to their network and led to a restructuring of how the electric industry operated in an effort to create competition in power generation  no longer were electric utilities built as vertical monopolies  where generation  transmission and distribution were handled by a single company  now  the three stages could be split among various companies  in an effort to provide fair accessibility to high voltage transmission  21 the
allowed incentives and loan guarantees for alternative energy production and advance innovative technologies that avoided greenhouse emissions

structure of distribution grids  
this article appears to contradict the article   please see discussion on the linked    may 2009    
transmission networks are complex with redundant pathways  for example  see the map of the united states   right  high-voltage transmission network 
the structure  or    of a grid can vary depending on the constraints of budget  requirements for system reliability  and the load and generation characteristics  the physical layout is often forced by what land is available and its geology  distribution networks are divided into two types  radial or network 
the cheapest   and simplest topology for a distribution or transmission grid is a radial structure  this is a tree shape where power from a large supply radiates out into progressively lower voltage lines until the destination homes and businesses are reached 
most transmission grids offer the reliability that more complex mesh networks provide  the expense of mesh topologies restrict their application to transmission and medium voltage distribution grids  redundancy allows line failures to occur and power is simply rerouted while workmen repair the damaged and deactivated line 
other topologies used are looped systems found in europe and tied ring networks 
the examples and perspective in this article may not represent a
of the subject  you may   discuss the issue on the   or   as appropriate   february 2010    
in cities and towns of north america  the grid tends to follow the classic radially fed design  a substation receives its power from the transmission network  the power is stepped down with a transformer and sent to a
from which feeders fan out in all directions across the countryside  these feeders carry   and tend to follow the major streets near the substation  as the distance from the substation grows  the fanout continues as smaller laterals spread out to cover areas missed by the feeders  this tree-like structure grows outward from the substation  but for reliability reasons  usually contains at least one unused backup connection to a nearby substation  this connection can be enabled in case of an emergency  so that a portion of a substation s service territory can be alternatively fed by another substation 
wide area synchronous grid  
main article 
a
or  interconnection  is a group of distribution areas all operating with
 ac  frequencies synchronized  so that peaks occur at the same time   this allows transmission of ac power throughout the area  connecting a large number of electricity generators and consumers and potentially enabling more efficient electricity markets and redundant generation  interconnection maps are shown of north america  right  and europe  below left  
in a synchronous grid all the generators run not only at the same
but also at the same   each generator maintained by a local
that regulates the driving torque by controlling the steam supply to the turbine driving it  generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid  because energy is consumed almost instantaneously as it is produced  energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators 
a large failure in one part of the grid - unless quickly compensated for - can cause current to re-route itself to flow from the remaining generators to consumers over transmission lines of insufficient capacity  causing further failures  one downside to a widely connected grid is thus the possibility of
and widespread   a central authority is usually designated to facilitate communication and develop protocols to maintain a stable grid  for example  the
gained binding powers in the united states in 2006  and has advisory powers in the applicable parts of canada and mexico  the u s  government has also designated   where it believes transmission bottlenecks have developed 
some areas  for example rural communities in   do not operate on a large grid  relying instead on local diesel generators 
lines or
can be used to connect two alternating current interconnection networks which are not synchronized with each other  this provides the benefit of interconnection without the need to synchronize an even wider area  for example  compare the wide area synchronous grid map of europe  above left  with the map of hvdc lines  below right  
redundancy and defining  grid   
a town is only said to have achieved
when it is connected to several
sources  generally involving long-distance transmission 
this redundancy is limited  existing national or regional grids simply provide the interconnection of facilities to utilize whatever redundancy is available  the exact stage of development at which the supply structure becomes a grid is arbitrary  similarly  the term national grid is something of an
in many parts of the world  as transmission cables now frequently cross national boundaries  the terms
for local connections and
for long-distance transmissions are therefore preferred  but national grid is often still used for the overall structure 
interconnected grid  
electric utilities across regions are many times interconnected for improved economy and reliability  interconnections allow for   allowing energy to be purchased from large  efficient sources  utilities can draw power from generator reserves from a different region in order to ensure continuing  reliable power and diversify their loads  interconnection also allows regions to have access to cheap bulk energy by receiving power from different sources  for example  one region may be producing cheap hydro power during high water seasons  but in low water seasons  another area may be producing cheaper power through wind  allowing both regions to access cheaper energy sources from one another during different times of the year  neighboring utilities also help others to maintain the overall system frequency and also help manage tie transfers between utility regions 
aging infrastructure  
despite the novel institutional arrangements and network designs of the electrical grid  its power delivery infrastructures suffer aging across the developed world  contributing factors to the current state of the electric grid and its consequences include 
aging equipment  older equipment has higher   leading to
affecting the economy and society  also  older assets and facilities lead to higher inspection
costs and further
and
costs 
obsolete system layout  older areas require serious additional
and
that cannot be obtained in current area and are forced to use existing  insufficient facilities 
outdated engineering  traditional tools for
planning and engineering are ineffective in addressing current problems of aged equipment  obsolete system layouts  and modern deregulated loading levels 
old cultural value      operating of system using concepts and procedures that worked in vertically integrated industry exacerbate the problem under a deregulated industry 
modern trends  
as the 21st century progresses  the electric utility industry seeks to take advantage of novel approaches to meet growing energy demand  utilities are under pressure to evolve their classic topologies to accommodate   as generation becomes more common from rooftop solar and wind generators  the differences between distribution and transmission grids will continue to blur  also 
is a grid management technique where retail or wholesale customers are requested either electronically or manually to reduce their load  currently  transmission grid operators use demand response to request load reduction from major energy users such as industrial plants 
with everything interconnected  and open competition occurring in a free market economy  it starts to make sense to allow and even encourage
 dg   smaller generators  usually not owned by the utility  can be brought on-line to help supply the need for power  the smaller generation facility might be a home-owner with excess power from their solar panel or wind turbine  it might be a small office with a diesel generator  these resources can be brought on-line either at the utility s behest  or by owner of the generation in an effort to sell electricity  many small generators are allowed to sell electricity back to the grid for the same price they would pay to buy it  furthermore  numerous efforts are underway to develop a     in the u s   the
and title xiii of the
are providing funding to encourage smart grid development  the hope is to enable utilities to better predict their needs  and in some cases involve consumers in some form of time-of-use based tariff  funds have also been allocated to develop more robust energy control technologies 
various planned and proposed systems to dramatically increase transmission capacity are known as   the promised benefits include enabling the
industry to sell electricity to distant markets  the ability to increase usage of intermittent energy sources by balancing them across vast geological regions  and the removal of congestion that prevents electricity markets from flourishing  local opposition to siting new lines and the significant cost of these projects are major obstacles to super grids  one study for a european super grid estimates that as much as 750 gw of extra transmission capacity would be required- capacity that would be accommodated in increments of 5 gw hvdc lines  a recent proposal by transcanada priced a 1,600-km  3-gw hvdc line at  3 billion usd and would require a corridor wide  in india  a recent 6 gw  1,850-km proposal was priced at  790 million and would require a wide right of way  with 750 gw of new hvdc transmission capacity required for a european super grid  the land and money needed for new transmission lines would be considerable 
future trends  
smart grid  
the electrical grid is expected to evolve to a new grid paradigm  the   an enhancement of the 20th century electrical grid  the traditional electrical grids are generally used to carry power from a few central generators to a large number of users or customers  in contrast  the new emerging smart grid uses two-way ows of electricity and information to create an automated and distributed advanced energy delivery network 
many research projects have been conducted to explore the concept of smart grid  according to a newest survey on smart grid  the research is mainly focused on three systems in smart grid- the infrastructure system  the management system  and the protection system 
the infrastructure system is the energy  information  and communication infrastructure underlying of the smart grid that supports
advanced   delivery  and consumption 
advanced information metering  monitoring  and management  and
advanced communication technologies 
in the transition from the conventional power grid to smart grid  we will replace a physical infrastructure with a digital one  the needs and changes present the power industry with one of the biggest challenges it has ever faced 
a smart grid would allow the power industry to observe and control parts of the system at higher resolution in time and space  it would allow for customers to obtain cheaper  greener  less intrusive  more reliable and higher quality power from the grid  the legacy grid did not allow for real time information to be relayed from the grid  so one of the main purposes of the smart grid would be to allow real time information to be received and sent from and to various parts of the grid to make operation as efficient and seamless as possible  it would allow us to manage logistics of the grid and view consequences that arise from its operation on a time scale with high resolution  from high-frequency switching devices on a microsecond scale  to wind and solar output variations on a minute scale  to the future effects of the carbon emissions generated by power production on a decade scale 
the management system is the subsystem in smart grid that provides advanced management and control services  most of the existing works aim to improve energy efciency  demand prole  utility  cost  and emission  based on the infrastructure by using     and   within the advanced infrastructure framework of smart grid  more and more new management services and applications are expected to emerge and eventually revolutionize consumers  daily lives 
the protection system is the subsystem in smart grid that provides advanced grid reliability analysis  failure protection  and security and privacy protection services  the advanced infrastructure used in smart grid on one hand empowers us to realize more powerful mechanisms to defend against attacks and handle failures  but opens up new vulnerabilities  for example 
pointed out that the major benefit provided by smart grid  the ability to get richer data to and from customer
and other electric devices  also give major privacy concerns  since the energy use information stored at the meter acts as an information-rich side channel  this information could be mined and retrieved by interested parties to reveal personal information such as individual s habits  behaviors  activities  and even beliefs   
grid defection  
as there is some resistance in the electric utility sector to the concepts of
with various
sources and microscale
units  several authors have warned that mass-scale
is possible because consumers can produce electricity using
systems primarily made up of
technology 
has proposed that there may wide scale   this is backed up by studies in the midwest
