clean technology refers to any process  product  or service that reduces negative environmental impacts through significant energy efficiency improvements  the sustainable use of resources  or environmental protection activities  clean technology includes a broad range of technology related to  
           etc                and more 
is a method by which new clean technology projects that have proven that they are  additional  or  beyond business as usual  can obtain financing through the generation of   a project that is developed with concern for climate change mitigation  such as a
project  is also known as a  
while there is no standard definition of  clean technology   it has been described by   a clean technology research firm  as  a diverse range of products  services  and processes that harness renewable materials and energy sources  dramatically reduce the use of natural resources  and cut or eliminate emissions and wastes   it notes that  clean technologies are competitive with  if not superior to  their conventional counterparts  many also offer significant additional benefits  notably their ability to improve the lives of those in both developed and developing countries  
investments in clean technology have grown considerably since coming into the spotlight around 2000  according to the   wind  solar  and biofuel companies received a record  148 billion in new funding in 2007 as rising oil prices and climate change policies encouraged investment in    50 billion of that funding went to wind power  overall  investment in clean-energy and energy-efficiency industries rose 60 percent from 2006 to 2007  by 2018 it is forecast that the three main clean technology sectors  solar photovoltaics  wind power  and biofuels  will have revenues of  325.1bn

definition  
cleantech is an industry term used to describe products or services that improve operational performance    or efficiency while reducing costs  inputs      or environmental   its origin is the increased consumer  regulatory  and industry interest in clean forms of energy generationspecifically  perhaps  the rise in awareness of     and the impact on the
from the burning of   cleantech is often associated with
funds and land use organizations 
origins of the concept  
the idea of cleantech first emerged among a group of emerging technologies and industries  based on principles of   resource efficiency  and second-generation production concepts in basic industries  examples include     
materials        and new paradigms in energy conservation  since the 1990s  interest in these technologies has increased with two trends  a decline in the relative cost of these technologies and a growing understanding of the link between industrial design used in the 19th century and early 20th century  such as fossil fuel power plants  the   and   and an emerging understanding of human-caused impact on earth systems resulting from their use  see articles

in north america  europe  china  and india totaled a record  8.4 billion  cleantech venture capital firms include ntec    and   the preliminary 2008 total represents the seventh consecutive year of growth in venture investing  widely recognized as a leading indicator of overall investment patterns 
is seen as a major growth market for cleantech investments currently  with a focus on renewable energy technologies  in 2014  israel  finland and the us were leading the global cleantech innovation index  out of 40 countries assessed  while russia and greece were last  with regards to private investments  the investment group element 8 has received the 2014 cleantech achievement award from the cleantech alliance  a trade association focused on clean tech in the state of washington  for its contribution in whashington state s cleantech industry 
according to the published research  the top clean technology sectors in 2008 were solar  biofuels  transportation  and wind  solar accounted for almost 40  of total clean technology investment dollars in 2008  followed by biofuels at 11
