denomination  the family encouraged competition  one visitor reported that  it didn t matter whether it was
or
or swimming to the dock     there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing  
at 13  he enrolled in the   a private preparatory school  when he was in the eighth grade  the mothers club at the school used proceeds from lakeside school s
to buy a
asr terminal and a block of computer time on a
 ge  computer for the school s students  gates took an interest in programming the ge system in   and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest  he wrote his first computer program on this machine  an implementation of
that allowed users to play games against the computer  gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly  when he reflected back on that moment  he said   there was just something neat about the machine   after the mothers club donation was exhausted  he and other students sought time on systems including
minicomputers  one of these systems was a
belonging to computer center corporation  ccc   which banned four lakeside students
gates      and kent evans
for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time 
at the end of the ban  the four students offered to find bugs in ccc s software in exchange for computer time  rather than use the system via teletype  gates went to ccc s offices and studied
for various programs that ran on the system  including programs in     and   the arrangement with ccc continued until 1970  when the company went out of business  the following year  information sciences  inc  hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in   providing them computer time and royalties  after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities  gates wrote the school s computer program to schedule students in classes  he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with  a disproportionate number of interesting girls   he later stated that  it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which i could so unambiguously demonstrate success   at age 17  gates formed a venture with allen  called   to make

processor  in early 1973  bill gates served as a congressional page in the u s  house of representatives

class by   one of his professors  gates  solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years  its successor is faster by only one percent  his solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist  
gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at harvard and spent a lot of time using the school s computers  gates remained in contact with paul allen  and he joined him at

 mits   the creators of the new microcomputer  to inform them that he and others were working on a
interpreter for the platform  in reality  gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it  they merely wanted to gauge mits s interest  mits president
agreed to meet them for a demo  and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair
that ran on a minicomputer  and then the basic interpreter  the demonstration  held at mits s offices in   was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as   paul allen was hired into mits  and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november 1975  they named their partnership  micro-soft  and had their first office located in albuquerque  within a year  the hyphen was dropped  and on november 26  1976  the trade name  microsoft  was registered with the office of the secretary of the   gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies 
microsoft s altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists  but gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed  in february 1976  gates wrote an
in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90  of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair  hobby market  was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce  distribute  and maintain high-quality software  this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists  but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment  microsoft became independent of mits in late 1976  and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems  the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in   washington  on january 1  1979 
during microsoft s early years  all employees had broad responsibility for the company s business  gates oversaw the business details  but continued to write code as well  in the first five years  gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped  and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit

operating system  ibm s discussions with digital research went poorly  and they did not reach a licensing agreement  ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system  a few weeks later  gates proposed using
 qdos   an operating system similar to cp m that
of
 scp  had made for hardware similar to the pc  microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent  and later the full owner  of 86-dos  after adapting the operating system for the pc  microsoft delivered it to ibm as
in exchange for a one-time fee of  50,000 
gates did not offer to transfer the
on the operating system  because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibm s system  they did  and the sales of
made microsoft a major player in the industry  despite ibm s name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer  pc magazine asked if gates were  the man behind the machine    and
quoted an expert as stating  it s gates  computer   gates oversaw microsoft s company restructuring on june 25  1981  which re-incorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman

management style
bill gates in january 2008
from microsoft s founding in 1975 until 2006  gates had primary responsibility for the company s product strategy  he aggressively broadened the company s range of products  and wherever microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it    he gained a reputation for being distant to others  as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that  gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls   another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times  when they met again a month later gates  won or tied every game  he had studied the game until he solved it  that is a competitor  
as an executive  gates met regularly with microsoft s senior managers and program managers  firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative  berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company s long-term interests at risk  he interrupted presentations with such comments  that s the stupidest thing i ve ever heard   and  why don t you just give up your
and join the    the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until  hopefully  gates was fully convinced  when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating  he was known to remark sarcastically   i ll do it over the weekend  
gates was an active software developer in microsoft s early history  particularly on the company s
products  but his role most of its history was primarily as management and executive  gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the   but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company s products  he remained interested in technical details 
wrote in 1985 that when watching gates announcing    something else impressed me  bill gates likes the program  not because it s going to make him a lot of money  although i m sure it will do that   but because it s a neat    on june 15  2006  gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy  he divided his responsibilities between two successors  placing
in charge of day-to-day management and
in charge of long-term product strategy

over the contextual meaning of words such as   compete    concerned   and  we   the judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition  businessweek reported 
early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying  i don t recall   so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle  worse  many of the technology chief s denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that gates both sent and received 
gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions  as to his demeanor during the deposition  he said   did i fence with boies      i plead guilty  whatever that penalty is should be levied against me  rudeness to boies in the first degree   despite gates  denials  the judge ruled that microsoft had committed

the moral systems of religion  i think  are super important  we ve raised our kids in a religious way  they ve gone to the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in  i ve been very lucky  and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world  and that s kind of a religious belief  i mean  it s at least a moral belief 
in the same interview  gates said   i agree with people like
that mankind felt the need for creation myths  before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that  we sought false explanations for them  now science has filled in some of the realm not all that religion used to fill  but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing  and there s no scientific explanation of how it came about  to say that it was generated by random numbers  that does seem  you know  sort of an uncharitable view  laughs   i think it makes sense to believe in god  but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it  i don t know
