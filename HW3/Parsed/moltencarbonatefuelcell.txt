scheme of a molten-carbonate fuel cell
molten-carbonate fuel cells  mcfcs  are high-temperature
that
of 600c and above 
molten carbonate fuel cells  mcfcs  are currently being developed for  
 produced as a result of
or    and -based power plants for   industrial  and
applications  mcfcs are high-temperature fuel cells that use an
composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous  chemically inert ceramic matrix of
 base   since they operate at extremely high temperatures of 650c  roughly 1,200f  and above  non-precious    
can be used as
at the
and   reducing costs 
improved efficiency is another reason mcfcs offer significant cost reductions over
 pafcs   molten carbonate fuel cells can reach efficiencies approaching 60   considerably higher than the 3742  efficiencies of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant  when the waste heat is   overall fuel efficiencies can be as high as 85  
unlike   phosphoric acid  and
electrolyte membrane fuel cells  mcfcs don t require an external reformer to convert more energy-dense fuels to   due to the high temperatures at which mcfcs operate  these fuels are converted to hydrogen within the fuel cell itself by a process called internal reforming  which also reduces cost 
molten carbonate fuel cells are not prone to
by
or
 they can even use carbon oxides as fuel  making them more attractive for fueling with gases made from coal  because they are more resistant to impurities than other fuel cell types  scientists believe that they could even be capable of internal reforming of coal  assuming they can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal  a dirtier
source than many others  into hydrogen  alternatively  because mcfcs require co2 be delivered to the cathode along with the oxidizer  they can be used to electrochemically separate carbon dioxide from the flue gas of other fossil fuel power plants for sequestration 
the primary disadvantage of current mcfc technology is durability  the high temperatures at which these cells operate and the corrosive electrolyte used accelerate component breakdown and corrosion  decreasing cell life  scientists are currently exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that increase cell life without decreasing performance

operation  
background  
molten carbonate fc s are a recently developed type of fuel cell that targets small and large energy distribution generation systems since their power production is in the 0.3-3 mw range  the operating pressure is between 1-8 atm while the temperatures are between 600-700 oc  due to the production of co2 during reforming of the fossil fuel  methane  natural gas   mcfcs are not a completely green technology  but are promising due to their reliability and efficiency  sufficient heat for co-generation with electricity   current mcfc efficiencies range from 60-70

materials  
due to the high operating temperatures of mcfcs  the materials need to be very carefully selected to survive the conditions present within the cell  the following sections cover the various materials present in the fuel cell and recent developments in research 
anode  
the
material typically consists of a
 3-6 m  45-70  material porosity  ni based alloy  ni is alloyed with either chromium or aluminum in the 2-10  range  these alloying elements allow for formation of licro2 lialo2 at the grain boundaries  which increases the materials 
resistance and prevents
of the anode at the high operating temperatures of the fuel cell  recent research has looked at using nano ni and other ni alloys to increase the performance and decrease the operating temperature of the fuel cell  a reduction in operating temperature would extend the lifetime of the fuel cell  i e  decrease corrosion rate  and allow for use of cheaper component materials  at the same time  a decrease in temperature would decrease ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and thus  the anode materials need to compensate for this performance decline  e g  by increasing power density   other researchers have looked into enhancing creep resistance by using a ni3al alloy anode to reduce mass transport of ni in the anode when in operation 
cathode  
on the other side of the cell  the
material is composed of a porous ni that is converted to a lithiated nickel oxide  lithium is
within the nio crystal structure   the pore size within the cathode is in the range of 7-15 m with 60-70  of the material being porous  the primary issue with the cathode material is dissolution of nio since it reacts with co2 when the cathode is in contact with the carbonate electrolyte  this dissolution leads to precipitation of ni metal in the electrolyte and since it is electrically conductive  the fuel cell can get short circuited  therefore  current studies have looked into the addition of mgo to the nio cathode to limit this dissolution  magnesium oxide serves to reduce the solubility of ni2  in the cathode and decreases precipitation in the electrolyte  alternatively  replacement of the conventional cathode material with a lifeo2-licoo2-nio alloy has shown promising performance results and almost completely avoids the problem of ni dissolution of the cathode 
electrolyte  
mcfcs use a liquid
 molten carbonate  which consists of a sodium na  and potassium k  carbonate  this electrolyte is supported by a ceramic  lialo2  matrix to contain the liquid between the electrodes  the high temperatures of the fuel cell is required to produce sufficient ionic conductivity of oxygen through this electrolyte  common mcfc electrolytes contain 62  li2co3 and 38  k2co3  a greater fraction of li carbonate is used due to its higher ionic conductivity but is limited to 62  due to its lower gas solubility and ionic diffusivity of oxygen  in addition  li2co3 is a very corrosive electrolyte and this ratio of carbonates provides the lowest corrosion rate  due to these issues  recent studies have delved into replacing the potassium carbonate with a sodium carbonate  a li na electrolyte has shown to have better performance  higher conductivity  and improves the stability of the cathode when compared to a li k electrolyte  li k is more    in addition  scientists have also looked into modifying the matrix of the electrolyte to prevent issues such as phase changes  -lialo2 to -lialo2  in the material during cell operation  the phase change accompanies a volume decrease in the electrolyte which leads to lower ionic conductivity  through various studies  it has been found that an alumina doped -lialo2 matrix would improve the phase stability while maintaining the fuel cell s performance 
mtu fuel cell  
the german company
presented an mcfc at the
in 2006  the unit weighs 2 tonnes and can produce 240kw of electric power from various gaseous fuels  including biogas  if fueled by fuels that contain carbon such as natural gas  the exhaust will contain co2 but will be reduced by up to 50  compared to diesel engines running on marine bunker fuel  the exhaust temperature is 400c  hot enough to be used for many industrial processes  another possibility is to make more electric power via a   depending on feed gas type  the electric efficiency is between 12  and 19   a steam turbine can increase the efficiency by up to 24   the unit can be used for
