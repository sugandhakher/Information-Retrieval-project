1.2mw
seagen is the world s first large scale commercial
  it was four times more powerful than any other tidal stream generator in the world at the time of installation 
the first seagen generator was installed in strangford narrows between
and
in  
in april 2008 and was connected to the grid in july 2008  it generates 1.2mw for between 18 and 20hours a day while the tides are forced in and out of
through the narrows  strangford lough was also the site of the very first known
in the world  the
where remains dating from 787 have been excavated

background  
the seagen rotors can be raised above the surface for maintenance 
seagen s predecessor  the 300kw  seaflow  turbine off the north coast of devon
  the developer of seagen  demonstrated first prototype of tidal stream generator in 1994 with a 15kilowatt system in   off the west coast of   in may 2003  the prototype for seagen   seaflow   was installed off the coast of     england  seaflow was a single rotor turbine which generated 300kw but was not connected to the grid  seaflow was the world s first offshore tidal generator  and remained the world s largest until seagen was installed 
technology  
seagen generator weighs 300tonnes  each driving a generator through a gearbox like a hydro-electric or wind turbine  these turbines have a patented feature by which the rotor blades can be pitched through 180degrees allowing them to operate in both flow directions  on ebb and flood tides  the company claims a
of 0.59  average of the last 2000 hours   the power units of each system are mounted on arm-like extensions either side of a tubular steel monopile some 3 metres  9.8ft  in diameter and the arms with the power units can be raised above the surface for safe and easy maintenance access  the seagen was built at  s  s shipyards 
environmental impact  
400million gallons of water flow in and out of
twice a day 
seagen has been licensed to operate over a period of 5years  during which there will be a comprehensive environmental monitoring programme to determine the precise impact on the marine environment 
problems  
during the commissioning of the system a software error caused the blades of one of the turbines to be damaged  this left the turbine operating at half power until autumn 2008  the incident is being investigated and mct is confident that it will not happen again  full power operation was finally achieved on 18 dec 2008
