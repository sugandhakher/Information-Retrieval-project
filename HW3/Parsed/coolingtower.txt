history  
a 1902 engraving of  barnard s fanless self-cooling tower   an early large evaporative cooling tower that relied on
and open sides rather than a fan  water to be cooled was sprayed from the top onto the radial pattern of vertical wire-mesh mats 
cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of
for use with the   condensers use relatively cool water  via various means  to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines  this reduces the   which in turn reduces the steam consumption  and thus the fuel consumption  while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler-water  however the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water  without which they are impractical  the consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 20402069  while water usage is not an issue with   it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems 
by the turn of the 20th century  several evaporative methods of recycling cooling water were in use in areas lacking an established water supply  as well as in urban locations where municipal water mains may not be of sufficient supply  be reliable in times of demand  or otherwise adequate to meet cooling needs  in areas with available land  the systems took the form of   in areas with limited land  such as in cities  it took the form of cooling towers 
these early towers were positioned either on the rooftops of buildings or as free-standing structures  supplied with air by fans or relying on natural airflow  an american engineering textbook from 1911 described one design as  a circular or rectangular shell of light plate  in effect  a chimney stack much shortened vertically  20 to 40 ft  high  and very much enlarged laterally  at the top is a set of distributing troughs  to which the water from the condenser must be pumped  from these it trickles down over  mats  made of wooden slats or woven wire screens  which fill the space within the tower  
a
cooling tower was patented by the dutch engineers
and
in 1918  the first hyperboloid cooling towers were built in 1918 near   the first ones in the united kingdom were built in 1924 at lister drive power station in   england to cool water used at a coal-fired electrical power station

to tower water at or near   air-cooled chillers must reject heat at the higher   and thus have a lower average reverse- effectiveness  in areas with a hot climate  large office buildings  hospitals  and schools typically use one or more cooling towers as part of their air conditioning systems  generally  industrial cooling towers are much larger than hvac towers 
hvac use of a cooling tower pairs the cooling tower with a water-cooled chiller or water-cooled condenser  a
is defined as the removal of 12,000
 3500 w   the equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 btu hour  4400 w  due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller s compressor  this equivalent ton is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 us gallons minute  1,500 pound hour  of water 10f  6c   which amounts to 15,000 btu hour  assuming a chiller
 cop  of 4.0  this cop is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio  eer  of 14 
cooling towers are also used in hvac systems that have multiple water source
that share a common piping water loop  in this type of system  the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode  then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the   by contrast  when the heat pumps are working in heating mode  the condensers draw heat out of the loop water and reject it into the space to be heated  when the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building  the cooling tower is normally shut down  and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage   and heat is supplied by other means  usually from separate  
industrial cooling towers  
industrial cooling towers for a power plant
industrial cooling towers can be used to remove heat from various sources such as machinery or heated process material  the primary use of large  industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating
systems used in    
plants 
processing plants  food processing plants  semi-conductor plants  and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns  for cooling liquid in crystallization  etc  the circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 mw
with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour  315,000 us gallons per minute  and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent  i e   3,600 cubic metres an hour  
if that same plant had no cooling tower and used once-through cooling water  it would require about 100,000 cubic metres an hour and that amount of water would have to be continuously returned to the ocean  lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant  furthermore  discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem  elevated water temperatures can kill
and other aquatic organisms  see    or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae  a cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water  evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes  other than rain somewhere   whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used  some coal-fired and
located in
areas do make use of once-through ocean water  but even there  the offshore discharge water outlet requires very careful design to avoid environmental problems 
petroleum refineries also have very large cooling tower systems  a typical large refinery processing 40,000 metric tonnes of crude oil per day  300,000 barrels  48,000m3  per day  circulates about 80,000 cubic metres of water per hour through its cooling tower system

field erected cooling tower
classification by build  
package type  
packaged cooling tower
these types of cooling towers are factory preassembled  and can be simply transported on trucks  as they are compact machines  the capacity of package type towers is limited and  for that reason  they are usually preferred by facilities with low heat rejection requirements such as food processing plants  textile plants  some chemical processing plants  or buildings like hospitals  hotels  malls  automotive factories etc 
due to their frequent use in or near residential areas  sound level control is a relatively more important issue for package type cooling towers 
field erected type  
facilities such as power plants  steel processing plants  petroleum refineries  or petrochemical plants usually install field erected type cooling towers due to their greater capacity for heat rejection  field erected towers are usually much larger in size compared to the package type cooling towers 
a typical field erected cooling tower has a
 frp  structure  frp   a mechanical unit for   drift eliminator  and fill 
heat transfer methods  
with respect to the
mechanism employed  the main types are 
dry cooling towers operate by
through a surface that separates the working fluid from ambient air  such as in a tube to air   utilizing convective heat transfer  they do not use evaporation 
wet cooling towers  or open circuit cooling towers  operate on the principle of   the working fluid and the evaporated fluid  usually water  are one and the same 
fluid coolers  or closed circuit cooling towers  are hybrids that pass the working fluid through a tube bundle  upon which clean water is sprayed and a fan-induced draft applied  the resulting heat transfer performance is much closer to that of a wet cooling tower  with the advantage provided by a dry cooler of protecting the working fluid from environmental exposure and contamination 
in a wet cooling tower  or open circuit cooling tower   the warm water can be cooled to a temperature lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature  if the air is relatively dry  see
and    as ambient air is drawn past a flow of water  a small portion of the water evaporates  and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water  thus reducing its temperature  approximately 970 btu of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water  2 mj kg   evaporation results in saturated air conditions  lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to   which is lower than the ambient   the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air 
to achieve better performance  more cooling   a medium called fill is used to increase the surface area and the time of contact between the air and water flows  splash fill consists of material placed to interrupt the water flow causing splashing  film fill is composed of thin sheets of material  usually   upon which the water flows  both methods create increased surface area and time of contact between the fluid  water  and the gas  air   to improve heat transfer 
air flow generation methods  
access stairs at the base of a massive hyperboloid cooling tower give a sense of its scale  uk 
with respect to drawing air through the tower  there are three types of cooling towers 
 utilizes buoyancy via a tall chimney  warm  moist air naturally rises due to the density differential compared to the dry  cooler outside air  warm
is less dense than drier air at the same pressure  this moist air buoyancy produces an upwards current of air through the tower 
mechanical draught  uses power-driven fan motors to force or draw air through the tower 
induced draught  a mechanical draft tower with a fan at the discharge  at the top  which pulls air up through the tower  the fan induces hot moist air out the discharge  this produces low entering and high exiting air velocities  reducing the possibility of recirculation in which discharged air flows back into the air intake  this fan fin arrangement is also known as draw-through 
forced draught  a mechanical draft tower with a blower type fan at the intake  the fan forces air into the tower  creating high entering and low exiting air velocities  the low exiting velocity is much more susceptible to recirculation  with the fan on the air intake  the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions  another disadvantage is that a forced draft design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design  the benefit of the forced draft design is its ability to work with high   such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations  this fan fill geometry is also known as blow-through 
fan assisted natural draught  a hybrid type that appears like a natural draft setup  though airflow is assisted by a fan 
 sometimes incorrectly known as   cooling towers have become the design standard for all natural-draft cooling towers because of their structural strength and minimum usage of material  the hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward
air flow  improving cooling efficiency  these designs are popularly associated with   however  this association is misleading  as the same kind of cooling towers are often used at large coal-fired power plants as well  conversely  not all nuclear power plants have cooling towers  and some instead cool their heat exchangers with lake  river or ocean water 
categorization by air-to-water flow  
crossflow  
mechanical draft crossflow cooling tower used in an hvac application
crossflow is a design in which the air flow is directed perpendicular to the water flow  see diagram at left   air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material  water flows  perpendicular to the air  through the fill by gravity  the air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume  lastly  a fan forces the air out into the atmosphere 
a distribution or hot water basin consisting of a deep pan with holes or nozzles in its bottom is located near the top of a crossflow tower  gravity distributes the water through the nozzles uniformly across the fill material 
advantages of the crossflow design 
gravity water distribution allows smaller pumps and maintenance while in use 
non-pressurized spray simplifies variable flow 
package crossflow cooling tower
typically lower initial and long-term cost  mostly due to pump requirements 
disadvantages of the crossflow design 
more prone to freezing than counterflow designs 
variable flow is useless in some conditions 
more prone to dirt buildup in the fill than counterflow designs  especially in dusty or sandy areas 
counterflow  
forced draft counter flow package type cooling towers
in a counterflow design  the air flow is directly opposite to the water flow  see diagram at left   air flow first enters an open area beneath the fill media  and is then drawn up vertically  the water is sprayed through pressurized nozzles near the top of the tower  and then flows downward through the fill  opposite to the air flow 
advantages of the counterflow design 
spray water distribution makes the tower more freeze-resistant 
breakup of water in spray makes heat transfer more efficient 
disadvantages of the counterflow design 
typically higher initial and long-term cost  primarily due to pump requirements 
difficult to use variable water flow  as spray characteristics may be negatively affected 
typically noisier  due to the greater water fall height from the bottom of the fill into the cold water basin
common aspects  
common aspects of both designs 
the interactions of the air and water flow allow a partial equalization of temperature  and evaporation of water 
the air  now saturated with water vapor  is discharged from the top of the cooling tower 
a  collection basin  or  cold water basin  is used to collect and contain the cooled water after its interaction with the air flow 
both crossflow and counterflow designs can be used in natural draft and in mechanical draft cooling towers 
wet cooling tower material balance  
quantitatively  the material balance around a wet  evaporative cooling tower system is governed by the operational variables of make-up  
and windage losses  draw-off rate  and the concentration cycles 
in the adjacent diagram  water pumped from the tower basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and
in an industrial facility  the cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed  and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water  c   the warm water returns to the top of the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower  as it trickles down  it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower  that contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage drift  w  and some of the water  e  to   the heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself  which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate  the evaporated water leaves its dissolved
behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated  thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water  to prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high  a portion of the water is drawn off blown down  d  for disposal  fresh water make-up  m  is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water  the windage loss water and the draw-off water

cycles of concentration  
cycle of concentration represents the accumulation of dissolved minerals in the recirculating cooling water  discharge of draw-off  or blowdown  is used principally to control the buildup of these minerals 
the chemistry of the make-up water  including the amount of dissolved minerals  can vary widely  make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies  lakes  rivers etc   tend to be aggressive to metals  corrosive   make-up waters from
supplies  such as   are usually higher in minerals  and tend to be
 deposit minerals   increasing the amount of minerals present in the water by cycling can make water less aggressive to piping  however  excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems 
relationship between cycles of concentration and flow rates in a cooling tower
as the cycles of concentration increase  the water may not be able to hold the minerals in solution  when the
of these minerals have been exceeded they can
out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the   the temperatures of the recirculating water  piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water  often a professional
consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for the cycles of concentration  the use of water treatment chemicals  pretreatment such as  
adjustment  and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration 
concentration cycles in the majority of cooling towers usually range from 3 to 7  in the united states  many water supplies use well water which has significant levels of dissolved solids  on the other hand  one of the largest water supplies  for   has a surface rainwater source quite low in minerals  thus cooling towers in that city are often allowed to concentrate to 7 or more cycles of concentration 
since higher cycles of concentration represent less make-up water 
efforts may focus on increasing cycles of concentration  highly treated recycled water may be an effective means of reducing cooling tower consumption of potable water  in regions where potable water is scarce 
water treatment

besides treating the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and   the water should be
to remove particulates  and also be dosed with
and
to prevent growths that could interfere with the continuous flow of the water  under certain conditions  a
of micro-organisms such as bacteria  fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water  and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower  biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using
or other chemicals  a normal industrial practice is to use two biocides i e  oxidising and non-oxidising to complement each other s strength and weaknesses and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack 
legionnaires  disease  
legionella pneumophila  5000x magnification 
further information 
and
another very important reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of   including species that cause
or legionnaires  disease  most notably l  pneumophila  or   the various legionella species are the cause of legionnaires  disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria  common sources of legionella include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems  domestic hot water systems  fountains  and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply  natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks 
french researchers found that legionella bacteria travelled up to 6 kilometres  3.7mi  through the air from a large contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant in pas-de-calais  france  that outbreak killed 21 of the 86 people who had a laboratory-confirmed infection 
drift  or windage  is the term for water droplets of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge  drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.0010.005  of the circulating flow rate  a typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets  a well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for legionella or water treatment chemical exposure 
many governmental agencies  cooling tower manufacturers and industrial trade organizations have developed design and maintenance guidelines for preventing or controlling the growth of legionella in cooling towers  below is a list of sources for such guidelines

terminology  
fill plates at the bottom of the
cooling tower  estonia   tower is shut down  revealing numerous water spray heads 
windage or drift  water droplets that are carried out of the cooling tower with the exhaust air  drift droplets have the same concentration of impurities as the water entering the tower  the drift rate is typically reduced by employing baffle-like devices  called drift eliminators  through which the air must travel after leaving the fill and spray zones of the tower  drift can also be reduced by using warmer entering cooling tower temperatures 
blow-out  water droplets blown out of the cooling tower by wind  generally at the air inlet openings  water may also be lost  in the absence of wind  through splashing or misting  devices such as wind screens  louvers  splash deflectors and water diverters are used to limit these losses 
plume  the stream of saturated exhaust air leaving the cooling tower  the plume is visible when water vapor it contains condenses in contact with cooler ambient air  like the saturated air in one s breath fogs on a cold day  under certain conditions  a cooling tower plume may present fogging or icing hazards to its surroundings  note that the water evaporated in the cooling process is  pure  water  in contrast to the very small percentage of drift droplets or water blown out of the air inlets 
draw-off or blow-down  the portion of the circulating water flow that is removed  usually discharged to a drain  in order to maintain the amount of
 tds  and other impurities at an acceptably low level  higher tds concentration in solution may result from greater cooling tower efficiency  however the higher the tds concentration  the greater the risk of scale  biological growth and corrosion  the amount of blow-down is primarily designated by measuring by the
of the circulating water  biological growth  scaling and corrosion can be prevented by chemicals  respectively  biocide  sulfuric acid  corrosion inhibitor   on the other hand  the only practical way to decrease the electrical conductivity is by increasing the amount of blow-down discharge and subsequently increasing the amount of clean make-up water 
zero bleed for cooling towers  also called zero blow-down for cooling towers  is a process for significantly reducing the need for bleeding

approach  the approach is the difference in temperature between the cooled-water temperature and the entering-air
 twb   since the cooling towers are based on the principles of evaporative cooling  the maximum cooling tower efficiency depends on the wet bulb temperature of the air  the wet-bulb temperature is a type of temperature measurement that reflects the physical properties of a system with a mixture of a gas and a vapor  usually air and water vapor
range  the range is the temperature difference between the warm water inlet and cooled water exit 
fill  inside the tower  fills are added to increase contact surface as well as contact time between air and water  to provide better heat transfer  the efficiency of the tower depends on the selection and amount of fill  there are two types of fills that may be used 
film type fill  causes water to spread into a thin film 
splash type fill  breaks up falling stream of water and interrupts its vertical progress 
full-flow filtration  full-flow filtration continuously strains particulates out of the entire system flow  for example  in a 100-ton system  the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal min  a filter would be selected to accommodate the entire 300 gal min flow rate  in this case  the filter typically is installed after the cooling tower on the discharge side of the pump  while this is the ideal method of filtration  for higher flow systems it may be cost-prohibitive 
side-stream filtration  side-stream filtration  although popular and effective  does not provide complete protection  with side-stream filtration  a portion of the water is filtered continuously  this method works on the principle that continuous particle removal will keep the system clean  manufacturers typically package side-stream filters on a skid  complete with a pump and controls  for high flow systems  this method is cost-effective  properly sizing a side-stream filtration system is critical to obtain satisfactory filter performance  but there is some debate over how to properly size the side-stream system  many engineers size the system to continuously filter the cooling tower basin water at a rate equivalent to 10  of the total circulation flow rate  for example  if the total flow of a system is 1,200 gal min  a 400-ton system   a 120 gal min side-stream system is specified

treated timber  a structural material for cooling towers which was largely abandoned about 10 years ago    it is still used occasionally due to its low initial costs  in spite of its short life expectancy  the life of treated timber varies a lot  depending on the operating conditions of the tower  such as frequency of shutdowns  treatment of the circulating water  etc  under proper working conditions  the estimated life of treated timber structural members is about 10 years

 frp  is known for its high corrosion-resistance capabilities  pultuded frp is produced using
technology  and has become the most common structural material for small cooling towers  it offers lower costs and requires less maintenance compared to reinforced concrete  which is still in use for large structures 
fog production  
fog clouds produced by
 uk 
under certain ambient conditions  plumes of water vapor  fog  can be seen rising out of the discharge from a cooling tower  and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire  if the outdoor air is at or near saturation  and the tower adds more water to the air  saturated air with liquid water droplets can be discharged  which is seen as fog  this phenomenon typically occurs on cool  humid days  but is rare in many climates 
this phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air  for that purpose  in hybrid towers  saturated discharge air is mixed with heated low relative humidity air  some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level  passing through heat exchangers  the relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower  the discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible 
salt emission pollution  
when wet cooling towers with seawater make-up are installed in various industries located in or near coastal areas  the drift of fine droplets emitted from the cooling towers contain nearly 6  sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas  this deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture vegetative lands can convert them into
or
depending on the nature of the soil and enhance the
of ground and surface water  the salt deposition problem from such cooling towers aggravates where national pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from wet cooling towers using seawater make-up 
  of less than 10
 m  in size  can be present in the drift from cooling towers  larger particles above 10m in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10m  referred to as pm10  can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems  similarly  particles smaller than 2.5m   pm2.5   tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung  and very small particles  less than 100 nanometers  may pass through the lungs to affect other organs  though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less  they contain more pm10 and pm2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up  this is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift  below 2,000ppm  compared to the salt content of sea water drift  60,000ppm

surfaces with any visible biofilm  i e   slime  should be cleaned 
disinfectant and other chemical levels in cooling towers and hot tubs should be continuously maintained and regularly monitored 
operation in freezing weather  
some cooling towers  such as smaller building air conditioning systems  are shut down seasonally  drained  and winterized to prevent freeze damage 
during the winter  other sites continuously operate cooling towers with 40f  4c  water leaving the tower  basin heaters  tower draindown  and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates  operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during very cold weather  typically  freezing starts at the corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load  severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice  resulting in increased structural loads which can cause structural damage or collapse 
to prevent freezing  the following procedures are used 
the use of water modulating by-pass systems is not recommended during freezing weather  in such situations  the control flexibility of variable speed motors  two-speed motors  and or two-speed motors multi-cell towers should be considered a requirement 
do not operate the tower unattended  remote sensors and alarms may be installed to monitor tower conditions 
do not operate the tower without a heat load  basin heaters may be used to keep the water in the tower pan at an above-freezing temperature  heat trace   heating tape   is a resistive heating element that is installed along water pipes to prevent freezing in cold climates 
maintain design water flow rate over the tower fill 
manipulate or reduce airflow to maintain water temperature above freezing point 
fire hazard  
cooling towers constructed in whole or in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation  such fires can become very intense  due to the high
of the towers  and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft  the resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure  for this reason  some
and standards recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic   fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation  such as for maintenance or construction   and even while the tower is in operation  especially those of the induced-draft type  because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers 
structural stability  
being very large structures  cooling towers are susceptible to wind damage  and several spectacular failures have occurred in the past  at
on 1 november 1965  the station was the site of a major   when three of the cooling towers collapsed owing to vibrations in 85mph  137km h  winds  although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds  the shape of the cooling towers caused westerly winds to be funnelled into the towers themselves  creating a   three out of the original eight cooling towers were destroyed  and the remaining five were severely damaged  the towers were later rebuilt and all eight cooling towers were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions  building codes were changed to include improved structural support  and
tests were introduced to check tower structures and configuration
