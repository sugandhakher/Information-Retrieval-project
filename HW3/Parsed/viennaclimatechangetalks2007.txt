main article 
copenhagen was the center of climate change negotiations in 2009 
following preparatory talks in bonn  in germany   bangkok and barcelona  the 2009 conference was held in december 2009 in     and the treaty succeeding the
had been expected to be adopted there 
some media sources claimed beforehand that the meeting would lead to empty promises without measurable goals  in a meeting of the group of eight   the world top leaders agreed to halve carbon emissions by 2050  however  they did not set specific targets because they did not agree on a base year  however members of the climate council acknowledged that action needs to happen fast   my personal view is that the future of humanity is at stake   said   professor at macquarie university and chairman of the copenhagen climate council  in an interview with  net 
at the conference  delegates approved a motion to  take note of the
of december 18  2009   the motion was not unanimous  therefore it is not considered to be legally binding  the un secretary general ban ki-moon welcomed the us-backed climate deal as an  essential beginning   although it subsequently emerged that the us had  used spying  threats and promises of aid  to gain support for the accord  under which its emissions pledge is the lowest by any leading nation 
the copenhagen accord recognises the scientific case for keeping temperature rises below 2c  but does not contain commitments for reduced emissions that would be necessary to achieve that aim  let alone 1.5c  one part of the agreement pledges
30billion to the developing world over the next three years  rising to us 100billion per year by 2020  to help poor countries adapt to climate change  earlier proposals  that would have aimed to limit temperature rises to 1.5c and cut co2 emissions by 80  by 2050 were dropped  an agreement was also reached that would set up a deal to reduce
in return for cash from developed countries
