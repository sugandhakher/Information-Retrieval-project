realisation of the potential  
the natural resource base for
is extraordinary by   and even global standards  in addition to an existing installed capacity of 1.3 gigawatts  gw  of
schemes  scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 gw of
and 7.5 gw of   25  of the estimated total capacity for the
and up to 14 gw of
potential  10  of eu capacity  the renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 gw or more  considerably greater than the existing capacity from all scottish fuel sources of 10.3 gw  scotland exceeded its renewable energy target  set in 2007  for 31  of total power generation coming from renewables by 2011  and the 2020 target for the renewable share of total electricity generation has been raised from 50  to 80  
in january 2006 the total installed electrical generating capacity from all forms of renewable energy was less than 2 gw  about a fifth of the total   by january 2007 wind power capacity  which has been growing rapidly  reached 1 gw capacity  and the total for renewables had grown to over 2.3 gw  by august 2009 wind power capacity was a fraction short of 1.5 gw and total renewables capacity had reached over 3.1 gw  by mid-2011 these figures were 2.76 gw and 4.6 gw respectively 
in 2012  over 40 per cent of scotland s electricity came from renewable energy  and scotland contributed almost 40 per cent of the uk s renewables output  at the end of 2012  there was 5,801
 mw  of installed renewables electricity capacity in scotland  an increase of 20.95 per cent  1,005 mw  on the end of 2011  renewable electricity generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 gwh  an increase of 7.3 per cent on 2011  the previous record year for renewables output  the bulk of electricity production is derived from gas and oil  2002 figures used in rspb scotland et al   2006  are gas  34    oil  28    coal  18   and
 17    with renewables 3   principally hydro-electric   prior to the substantial growth in wind power output  it should be borne in mind that electricity production is only part of the overall energy use budget  in 2002  scotland consumed a total of 175
 twh  of energy in all forms  some 2  less than in 1990  of this  only 20  was consumed in the form of electricity by end users  the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil  41   and gas  36   
the renewable energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in scotland  according to a 2013 study by   however a 2011 study by 4-consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in scotland from government support for renewable energy  they estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 3002,200 long-term jobs by 2020  with 20 gw of renewable energy projects in the pipeline  the sector has the potential to grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region  glasgow  fife and edinburgh are key centres of
development  and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the highlands and islands  rural job creation is being supported by
systems in areas such as  
and  
scotland also has significant quantities of
deposits  including 62.4  of the eu s proven reserves of oil  12.5  of the eu s proven reserves of gas and 69  of uk coal reserves  nonetheless  the
has set ambitious targets for renewable energy production  in 2005 the aim was for 18  of scotland s electricity production to be generated by renewable sources by 2010  rising to 40  by 2020  in 2007 this was increased to 50 per cent of electricity from renewables by 2020  with an interim target of 31 per cent by 2011  the following year new targets to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 80  by 2050 were announced and then confirmed in the 2009 climate change delivery plan  maf smith  director of the
in scotland said  governments across the world are shying away from taking the necessary action  the scottish government must be commended for its intention to lead the way  
an important reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced   the  s proposal that
emissions should be reduced by 60  was incorporated into the uk government s 2003 energy   the 2006
proposed a 55  reduction by 2030  the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change s fourth assessment report has further increased the profile of the issue 
hydro-electric power

a typical
hydro-electric dam at loch laggan
scotland has 85  of the uk s
energy resource  much of it developed by the
in the 1950s  the  hydro board   which brought  power from the glens   was a nationalised industry at the time although it was
in 1989 and is now part of  
current capacity is 1.54 gw and includes major developments such as the 120 mw
and the 245 mw
system  several of scotland s hydro-electric plants were built to power the
industry  these were built in several  schemes  of linked stations  each covering a   whereby the same water may generate power several times as it descends  numerous remote
were flooded by these schemes  many of the largest of which involved tunnelling through mountains as well as damming rivers  emma wood  the author of a study of these pioneers wrote 
i heard about drowned farms and hamlets  the ruination of the salmon-fishing and how
might be washed away if the dams failed inland  i was told about the huge veins of crystal they found when they were tunnelling deep under the mountains 
it is estimated that as much as another 1.2 gw of capacity remains available to exploit  mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in
and a system planned for   in reality  environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited it is unlikely that the full 1.2 gw will exploited  there is also further potential for new
schemes  at present used to meet peak demand  that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave  examples include the 440 mw
and 300 mw
schemes  the 100 mw
which opened in 2009 was the first large scale scheme in scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind  a 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 gw of electricity for 5 hours  then drop to 1.1 gw and run out of water in 22 hours  the report concluded that even with projected new schemes at loch ness and loch sloy  pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods

the siting of turbines is sometimes an issue  but surveys have generally shown high levels of community acceptance for wind power in scotland  wind farm developers sometimes offer  community benefit funds  to help address any disadvantages faced by those living adjacent to wind farms  there is further potential for expansion  especially offshore given the high average wind speeds  and a number of large offshore wind farms are planned 
it is estimated that 11.5 gw of onshore wind potential exists  enough to provide 45 twh of energy  more than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land  the total offshore potential is estimated at 25 gw  which although more expensive to install  could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in scotland  plans to harness up to 4.8 gw of the potential in the inner

another approach was used by the limpet 500  land installed marine power energy transformer  energy converter which was installed on the island of

unlike wind and wave 
is an inherently predictable source  however the technology is in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages  today it is known that a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine  but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested  this is the current situation with regard to tidal power  some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction  the tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin  as the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a  
captures energy from the flow of tides  usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine  an example is marine current turbines seagen 1.2mw device at
in northern ireland  which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world  to date the only installed tidal power plant of any size is the 240mw rated
at the rance estuary in   which has been operating successfully for more than 25 years  although there are a number of other much smaller projects around the world 
the
between orkney and mainland scotland has been described as the   of tidal power  and may be capable of generating up to 10 gw although a more recent estimate suggests an upper limit of 1.9 gw  in march 2010 a total of ten sites in the area  capable of providing an installed capacity of 1.2 gw of tidal and wave generation were leased out by the crown estate  several other tidal sites with considerable potential exist in the orkney archipelago  tidal races on the west coast at kylerhea between
and   the grey dog north of   the dorus mr off
and the
also offer significant prospects 
in august 2010 the atlantis resources corporation s ak-1000 turbine  which has 18-metre  59ft  blades was unveiled at   it is claimed to be the largest tidal turbine ever built and will be tested by emec off eday  in october 2010 meygen  a consortium of   atlantis resources corporation and   received a 25-year operational lease from the crown estate for a 400 mw
project in the   however  in 2011 the plans were in difficulty after norwegian partners
pulled out of the project  in december 2014  atlantis announced that onshore construction at the project site for connection to the electricity transmission grid would commence in january 2015  the first power to the national grid is expected to be delivered in 2016 
in 2010 it was announced that 10 hammerfest strom hs1000 norwegian turbines  capable of generating 1 mw each  could be installed in the
and that the bifab yard at arnish had won a 2 million contract to build some of the structures  components  the following march this project  which will become the largest tidal array in the world  was approved by the scottish government with 10 planned tidal turbines predicted to generate enough power for over 5,000 homes  the sound of islay offers both high currents and shelter from storms  a single 1 mw hs1000 was installed at emec off eday  orkney by the end of 2011 
the  world s first community-owned tidal power generator  became operational in
off yell  shetland in early 2014  this 30kw nova innovation device feeds into the local grid  and a 100kw tidal turbine was connected in august 2016  at the opposite end of the country a 2010 consultants  report into the possibility of a scheme involving the construction of a solway barrage  possibly south of   concluded that the plans  would be expensive and environmentally sensitive   in 2013 an alternative scheme using the verderg renewable energy spectral marine energy converter was proposed for a plan involving the use of a bridge along the route of an abandoned railway line between annan and  
biofuels

biodiesel  
various
schemes exist at present  and as with most renewables  interest is growing in the subject  westray development trust operate a biodiesel vehicle fuelled by the residual vegetable oils from the orkney archipelago
outlets  on a larger scale argent energy s plant in
recycles tallow and used cooking oil to produce 50,000,000 litres  13,000,000usgal  of biodiesel per annum 
a major benefit of biodiesel is lower carbon emissions  although the energy balance of liquid biofuels is a matter of controversy  research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel  and the
intends to ensure that 5.75  europe s transport fuel comes from renewable sources by 2010  however  there is only enough used vegetable oil in the uk to contribute 0.38  of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the uk were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22  of the existing requirement for road transport  serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to europe have been raised on the grounds that they may replace much needed food crops  converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place  but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure  developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception 
due to the relatively short growing season for sugar producing crops 
is not commercially produced as a fuel in scotland at present  however  there are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops to be used to this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques 
biogas  anaerobic digestion and landfill gas  
  or   is a biofuel produced through the intermediary stage of
consisting mainly of 4590  biologically produced
and carbon dioxide  in early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in
in the   the
 sepa  and the renewable energy association are also leading the way towards the establishment of a
standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land  anaerobic digestion and
facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in scotland  such as  
it has been recognised that biogas  mainly methane   produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter  is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock  it is estimated that 0.4 gw of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in scotland  the scottish executive and sepa has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the british anaerobic digestion company greenfinch in southwest scotland  landfill sites have the potential for a further 0.07 gw with sites such as the
in falkirk already utilising their potential 
solid biomass  
further information 
a 2007 report concluded that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind as the largest potential source of renewable energy  scotland s forests  which made up 60  of the uk resource base  were forecast to be able to provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum  the biomass energy supply in scotland was forecast to reach 450 mw or higher   predominantly from wood   with power stations requiring 4,5005,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity  however a 2011
and scottish government follow-up report concluded that      there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource   a plan to build in edinburgh a 200 mw biomass plant which would have imported 83  of its wood  was withdrawn by forth energy in 2012  the energy company e on has constructed a 44 mw biomass power station at
using locally sourced crops while the smaller epr westfield power plant in fife produces 9.8 mw of output using chicken litter as fuel  the scottish executive and the forestry commission issued a scottish biomass action plan in 2007  the scottish government set up the scottish biomass support scheme in 2006 with a 7.5 million grant  later increased to 10.5 million  to support biomass energy  6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in march 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had     achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives   a 2007 article by renew scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems  these boilers might be cheaper to run and  by using locally produced wood fuel  could try to be as carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation 
there is also local potential for
such as short-rotation willow or poplar     agricultural wastes such as straw and manure  and forestry residues  these crops could provide 0.8 gw of generating capacity 
micro systems  
whisky distilleries have a role to play in keeping scots warm
the energy savings trust has estimated that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the uk s electricity demand by 2050 although only a fraction of this would come from renewable sources  the current scottish output is negligible  in may 2006 the then communities minister
launched a planning advice note aimed at promoting micro-renewables  small-scale  wind2heat  projects  which use wind turbines to power electrical
directly  have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas  as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps 
may have a locally important part to play  caithness heat and power have announced plans to tackle
in
by utilising a wood chip
scheme in partnership with the old pulteney distillery  on the island of islay  a swimming pool is heated using waste heat from the
distillery  in edinburgh  tynecastle high school  due to be completed in 2010  will be heated by waste heat from the neighbouring north british distillery  in 2009 the
distillery announced plans for a 65million facility to generate energy from the spent  wash  created in the manufacturing process  which will aim to replace 95  of the plan s existing fossil fuel use 
there are also a growing number of
systems on smaller watercourses  especially in more remote rural locations

panels  which generate electricity  in 2004  the largest installation in scotland was a 21 kwp system at the sir e  scott secondary school in tarbert 
although larger systems have been completed since then  the uk s practicable resource is estimated at 7.2 twh per annum  which in the scottish context is the approximate equivalent of 70 mw or less of installed capacity 
the  road energy system  uses water pipes buried beneath a layer of   in the summer  the dark asphalt is heated by the sun which in turn heats the water in the pipes  this water can be stored in an underground aquifer and the heat extracted in winter using a heat pump  the system can be used to warm or cool down roads  keeping them ice-free and or preventing softening due to overheating  alternatively  the stored energy can be used for cooling buildings  the system was developed in the netherlands and has been licensed by -based invisible energy systems  who have installed the technology in their car park 
geothermal energy  
further information 
is obtained by tapping the heat of the earth itself  most systems in scotland provide heating through a ground source
which brings energy to the surface via shallow pipe works  an example is the glenalmond street project in   which uses a combination of solar and geothermal energy to heat 16 houses  water in a coal mine 100 metres  328ft  below ground level is heated by geothermal energy and maintained at a temperature of about 12
 54   throughout the year  the warmed water is raised and passed through a heat pump  boosting the temperature to 55c  131f   and is then distributed to the houses providing heating to radiators 
although the pumps may not be powered from renewable sources  up to four times the energy used can be recovered  installation costs can vary from 7,000 to 10,000  and grants may be available from the scottish community and householders renewables initiative operated by
for domestic properties up to a maximum of 4,000  perhaps up to 7.6 twh of energy is available on an annual basis from this source 
there is also potential for geothermal energy production from decommissioned oil and gas fields 
other means of reducing carbon emissions  
it is clear that if carbon emissions are to be reduced  a combination of increased production from renewables and decreased consumption of energy in general and fossil fuels in particular will be required  on the latter front    the then uk   announced in november 2006 that within a decade all new houses would have to be    a variety of other options exist  most of which may affect development of renewable technologies even if they are not means of producing energy from renewable sources themselves 
other renewable options  
various other ideas for renewable energy in the early stages of development  such as     and   have received little attention in scotland  presumably because the potential is so significant for less speculative technologies 
carbon offsetting  
involves individuals or organisations compensating for their use of fossil fuels by making payments to projects that aim to neutralise the effect of these carbon emissions  although the idea has become fashionable  the theory has received serious criticism of late 
nonetheless  a credible option may be to plant trees within the local bioregion and maintain the forest on a permanent basis  thus locking up carbon produced by burning fossil fuels  in british growing conditions this method can compensate for carbon at a rate of 200
per square kilometre  0.89 acre  planted over a 100-year period  thus a 4-square-kilometre  988-acre  plantation could uptake 200 tonnes  220tons  of carbon over twenty-five years  this is the equivalent of 10,000 tonnes  11,000short tons  of carbon dioxide  the weaknesses of the approach include uncertainty as to whether the planting might have occurred anyway and who  in the future  will ensure permanence  however  there is likely to be a greater level of credibility inherent in a nearby and visible scheme than in a far-distant one 
challenges and opportunities offered by non-renewables  
the following technologies are means of reducing the effect of carbon emissions and form an important aspect of the energy debate in scotland and are included here for completeness  their effect is likely to influence the future direction of commercial renewable energy  but they are not renewable forms of energy production themselves 
carbon sequestration  also known as   this technology involves the storage of carbon dioxide  co2  that is a by-product of industrial processes through its injection into oil fields  it is not a form of renewable energy production  but it may be a way to significantly reduce the effect of fossil fuels whilst renewables are commercialised  it may also be an intermediate step towards a  hydrogen economy   see below   which could either enable further renewable development or conceivably out-compete it  the technology has been successfully pioneered in
but is still a relatively untried concept 
 clean coal  technology  it has been estimated that it will be 2020 to 2025 before any commercial-scale clean coal power stations  coal-burning power stations with carbon capture and sequestration  are widely adopted  moreover  some have criticised the clean coal approach and it is at best a means of ameliorating carbon emissions  it is not a form of renewable energy production  although like carbon sequestration it offers a significant commercial challenge to renewable developments  in 2009 a licence to test underground coal gassification technology in fife was granted to thornton new energy  however  a plan to build a new  clean coal  power station at
collapsed in 2009 after financial backing was withdrawn 
nuclear power  renewable energy as a concept generally excludes
although this stance has been challenged 
incineration  there is a successful
plant at
in shetland which burns 22,000 tonnes  24,250tons  of waste every year and provides district heating to over 600 customers  although such plants generate carbon emissions through the combustion of the biological material and plastic wastes  which derive from fossil fuels   they also reduce the damage done to the atmosphere from the creation of
in landfill sites  this is a much more damaging greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide the burning process produces  although other systems which do not involve district heating may have a similar carbon footprint to straightforward landfill degradation 
hydrogen  
hypod and windmills at the pure site on
although
offers significant potential as an alternative to hydrocarbons as a carrier of energy  neither hydrogen itself nor the associated
technologies are sources of energy in themselves  nevertheless  the combination of renewable technologies and hydrogen is of considerable interest to those seeking   there are a number of scottish projects involved in this research  supported by the scottish hydrogen   fuel cell association  shfca  
the pure project on
in shetland is a ground-breaking training and research centre which uses a combination of the ample supplies of wind power and fuel cells to create a
system  two 15kw turbines are attached to a  hypod  fuel cell  which in turn provides power for heating systems  the creation of stored liquid hydrogen and an innovative fuel-cell driven car  the project is community-owned and part of the unst partnership  the community s

a plan to enable a 10 million waste management plant into a hydrogen production facility was announced in june 2006  the council have also agreed to purchase hydrogen-fuelled buses and hope the new plant  which will be constructed in partnership with the local hydrogen research laboratory  will supply island filling stations and houses and the industrial park at arnish

local vs national concerns  
 a battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists  
a significant feature of scotland s renewable potential is that the resources are largely distant from the main centres of population  this is by no means coincidental  the power of wind  wave and tide on the north and west coasts and for hydro in the mountains makes for dramatic scenery  but sometimes harsh living conditions

this happenstance of geography and climate has created various tensions  there is clearly a significant difference between a renewable energy production facility of modest size providing an island community with all its energy needs  and an industrial scale power station in the same location that is designed to export power to far distant urban locations  thus  plans for one of the world s largest onshore windfarms on the hebridean island of
have generated considerable debate  a related issue is the
which brings electricity from renewable projects in the north and west to the cities of the south  the matter went to a
and has been described by ian johnston of
as a  battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists and giant energy companies against aristocratic landowners and
chiefs   in january 2010   the energy minister  announced that the project would be going ahead  notwithstanding the more than 18,000 objections received  53km of the 132kv line inside the park was taken down and not replaced  the  line was energized by christmas 2015 
there is considerable support for community-scale energy projects  for example  alex salmond    has stated that  we can think big by delivering small  and aspires to have a  million scottish households with access to their own or community renewable generation within ten years   the
has also stated that  the best renewable energy options around wild land are small-scale  sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them   although even community-owned schemes can prove controversial 
a related issue is the position of scotland within the united kingdom  it has been alleged that uk transmission pricing structures are weighted against the development of renewables in scotland  a debate which highlights the contrast between the sparsely populated north of scotland and the highly urbanised south and east of england  although the
of scotland and england are similar the relationship between this footprint and the
of the respective countries are not  scotland s biocapacity  a measure of the biologically productive area  is 4.52
 gha  per head  some 15  less than the current ecological effect  in other words  with a 15  reduction in consumption  the scottish population could live within the productive capacity of the land to support them  however  the uk ecological footprint is more than three times the biocapacity  which is only 1.6 gha head  amongst the lowest in europe  thus  to achieve the same end in the uk context  consumption would have to be reduced by about 66  
the
economy is very dependent on inexpensive  point-source  fossil fuels  scotland  as a relatively sparsely populated country with significant renewable resources  is in a unique position to demonstrate how the transition to a low-carbon  widely distributed energy economy may be undertaken  a balance will need to be struck between supporting this transition and providing exports to the economies of densely populated regions in the
and elsewhere  as they seek their own solutions  the tension between local and national needs in the scottish context may therefore also play out on the wider uk and european stage 
promotion of renewables  
growing national concerns regarding
and climate change have driven the subject of renewable energy high up the political agenda  various public bodies and public-private partnerships have been created to develop the potential  the    freds  is a partnership between industry  academia and government aimed at enabling scotland to capitalise on its renewable energy resource  the scottish renewables forum is an important intermediary organisation for the industry  hosting the annual green energy awards 
provides advice  funding and finance for renewable energy projects developed by community groups  aberdeen renewable energy group  areg  is a public-private partnership created to identify and promote renewable energy opportunities for businesses in the north-east  in 2009 areg formed an alliance with north scotland industries group to help promote the north of scotland as an  international renewable energy hub  
the forestry commission is active in promoting the biomass potential  the climate change business delivery group aims to act as a way for businesses to share best practice and address the climate change challenge  numerous universities are playing a role in supporting energy research under the supergen programme  including
research at   marine technologies at   distributed power systems at
and biomass crops at the  s  
in 2010 the
student freshers  festivals held in edinburgh and glasgow were powered entirely by renewable energy in a bid to raise awareness among young people in scotland 
recent events  
new data appears on a regular basis and milestones in 200714 include the following 
in february 2007 the commissioning of the
wind farm took the uk renewables installed capacity up to 2 gw  total scottish capacity in october 2007 was 1.13 gw from 760 turbines  and increased to 1.3 gw by september 2008  and 1.48 gw by august 2009 
also during 2007 scottish and southern energy plc in conjunction with the
began the implementation of a  regional power zone  in the orkney archipelago  this ground-breaking scheme  that may be the first of its kind in the world  involves  active network management  that will make better use of the existing infrastructure and allow a further 15 mw of new  non-firm generation  output from renewables onto the network  heat and power ltd  of westray are involved in developing an innovative digestor system that is being trialled at tuquoy farm  designed by sam harcus and colin risbridger  it is capable of handling up to 1,500 tonnes of feedstock per annum  scottish   southern energy have been asked to provide for an export capacity of 40 kwe  the aim is to help move the farm towards being powered by  
in january 2008 it was reported that professor graeme walker of the
is leading a project aimed at using grain that is a by-product of whisky distilling as a biofuel  in february 2008 plans to build a 10 mw prototype tidal energy plant in the pentland firth were announced by tocardo tidal energy ltd  of wick  production was expected to commence in 2009  the following september  scottish power announced plans for two tidal projects in the same area  pending successful tests of a 6 million prototype 
in january 2009 the government announced the launch of a  marine spatial plan  to map the potential of the pentland firth and orkney coasts and agreed to take part in a working group examining options for an offshore grid to connect renewable energy projects in the north sea to on-shore national grids  the potential for such a scheme has been described as including acting as a  30 gw battery for europe s clean energy  
in july 2009   the  
and
published a study called  the power of scotland renewed   this study claimed that the country could meet all its electricity needs by 2030 without the requirement for either nuclear or fossil fuel powered installations 
in april 2010 permission was granted for four new hydro schemes totalling 6.7 mw capacity in the  
sea energy renewables ltd was purchased by spanish company
in june 2010  this move paved the way for the inch cape 180 wind turbine project offshore from   scheduled for a 2018 completion  work is not expected to start before 2015 
in 2013  a yougov energy survey concluded that 
new yougov research for scottish renewables shows scots are twice as likely to favour wind power over nuclear or shale gas  over six in ten  62   people in scotland say they would support large scale wind projects in their local area  more than double the number who said they would be generally for shale gas  24   and almost twice as much as nuclear  32    hydro power is the most popular energy source for large scale projects in scotland  with an overwhelming majority  80   being in favour 
in august 2013 scottish hydro electric power distribution connected a 2 mw
at
power station  this was the uk s first large scale battery connected to a local electricity distribution network 
in september 2013 the scottish government granted permission for the commencement of the  largest tidal energy project in europe   meygen intends to install a 9 mw demonstration turbine and then an 86 mw array tidal array in the pentland firth  with expected completion in 2020 
in july 2014 the crown estate gave approval to four new demonstration wave and tidal sites at the   the   islay and harris

table notes
a 
note on  installed capacity  and  potential energy   the former is an estimate of the maximum productive output of a given technology or individual generation station at a single point in time  the latter takes into account the likely intermittency of energy supply and is a measure of output over a period of time  thus  for example  individual wind turbines may have a  capacity factor  of between 15  and 45  depending on their location  with a higher capacity factor giving a greater potential energy output for a given installed capacity  the  potential energy  column is thus an estimate based on a variety of assumptions including the installed capacity  although  potential energy  is in some ways a more useful method of comparing the current output and future potential of different technologies  using it would require cumbersome explanations of all the assumptions involved in each example  so installed capacity figures are generally used 
b  table notes and sources 
total capacity from all sources in 2006 was estimated at 10.3 gw and 9.8 gw  it is estimated by rspb scotland et al   february 2006  that electricity output would decline from the current total of 50 twh per annum to about a third of this figure by 2020 due to decommissioning of existing non-renewable capacity if no new capacity was installed  in 2006 total energy demand was 177.8 twh  electricity makes up 20  of total energy use  but about 15 twh are exported or lost in transmission 
the main source assumes grid capacity is available  without this the potential drops significantly to circa 33 twh 
the tidal potential of the pentland firth alone is estimated elsewhere at over 10 gw 
potential hydro production source  extrapolated from 2004 data in
geothermal potential capacity is estimated from potential output 
micro generation  including solar  is estimated as having the potential of producing up to 40  of current electrical demand by 2050 i e  circa 14 twh  the above figures assume 12  by 2020 
blank entries mean no data is available  in the cases of the current capacity of biomass  biodiesel and geothermal these will have been very small
