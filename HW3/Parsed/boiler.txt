a boiler is a closed

or other
is heated  the fluid does not necessarily    in north america  the term    is normally used if the purpose is not to actually boil the fluid   the heated or vaporized fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications  including         and

materials  
the

 or    or historically of     especially of the
types  is not used in wetted parts of boilers due to corrosion and stress corrosion cracking  however  ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to   and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european  pressure equipment directive  for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors

or
is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers  historically  copper was often used for
 particularly for    because of its better formability and higher thermal conductivity  however  in more recent times  the high price of copper often makes this an uneconomic choice and cheaper substitutes  such as steel  are used instead 
for much of the victorian  age of steam   the only material used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron  with assembly by   this iron was often obtained from specialist   such as at
 uk   noted for the high quality of their
and its suitability for high-reliability use in critical applications  such as high-pressure boilers  in the 20th century  design practice instead moved towards the use of steel  which is stronger and cheaper  with
construction  which is quicker and requires less labour  it should be noted  however  that wrought iron boilers corrode far slower than their modern-day steel counterparts  and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion  this makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to those of welded steel boilers 
may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters  although such heaters are usually termed  boilers  in some countries  their purpose is usually to produce hot water  not steam  and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid actual boiling  the brittleness of cast iron makes it impractical for high-pressure steam boilers 
energy  
the source of heat for a boiler is
of any of several   such as       or  
use
or
heating elements 
is also used as a heat source for generating   either directly  bwr  or  in most cases  in specialised
called  steam generators   pwr  
 hrsgs  use the heat rejected from other processes such as  
boiler efficiency  
there are two methods to measure the boiler efficiency 1  direct method 2  indirect method
direct method -direct method of boiler efficiency test is more usable or more common
boiler efficiency  q  hg-hf  q gcv  100 q  total steam flow hg  enthalpy of saturated steam in k cal kg hf  enthalpy of feed water in kcal kg q  quantity of fuel use in kg hr gcv  gross calorific value in kcal kg like pet coke  8200 kcal kg 
indirect method -to measure the boiler efficiency in indirect method we need a following parameter like 1 ultimate analysis of fuel  h2 s2 s c moisture constraint ash constraint  2 percentage of o2 or co2 at flue gas 3 flue gas temperature at outlet 4 ambient temperature in deg c and humidity of air in kg kg 5 gcv of fuel in kcal kg 6 ash percentage in combustible fuel 7 gcv of ash in kcal kg
configurations  
boilers can be classified into the following configurations 
pot boiler or haycock boiler   a primitive  kettle  where a fire heats a partially filled water container from below  18th century haycock boilers generally produced and stored large volumes of very low-pressure steam  often hardly above that of the atmosphere  these could burn wood or most often  coal  efficiency was very low 
with one or two large fluesan early type or forerunner of  
diagram of a fire-tube boiler
  here  water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam  steam space   this is the type of boiler used in nearly all steam locomotives  the heat source is inside a furnace or firebox that has to be kept permanently surrounded by the water in order to maintain the temperature of the heating surface below the   the furnace can be situated at one end of a fire-tube which lengthens the path of the hot gases  thus augmenting the heating surface which can be further increased by making the gases reverse direction through a second parallel tube or a bundle of multiple tubes  two-pass or return flue boiler   alternatively the gases may be taken along the sides and then beneath the boiler through flues  3-pass boiler   in case of a locomotive-type boiler  a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer  fire-tube boilers usually have a comparatively low rate of steam production  but high steam storage capacity  fire-tube boilers mostly burn solid fuels  but are readily adaptable to those of the liquid or gas variety 
diagram of a water-tube boiler 
  in this type  tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations  often the water tubes connect large drums  the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water  in other cases  such as a mono-tube boiler  water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils  this type generally gives high steam production rates  but less storage capacity than the above  water tube boilers can be designed to exploit any heat source and are generally preferred in high-pressure applications since the high-pressure water steam is contained within small diameter pipes which can withstand the pressure with a thinner wall 
  a flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them  a flash boiler differs from the type of mono-tube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water  in a flash boiler  the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated  flash boilers had some use in automobiles in the 19th century and this use continued into the early 20th century   
1950s design   from a
fire-tube boiler with water-tube firebox  sometimes the two above types have been combined in the following manner  the firebox contains an assembly of water tubes  called   the gases then pass through a conventional firetube boiler  water-tube fireboxes were installed in many
locomotives    but have met with little success in other countries 
sectional boiler  in a cast iron sectional boiler  sometimes called a  pork chop boiler  the water is contained inside cast iron sections    these sections are assembled on site to create the finished boiler

to define and secure boilers safely  some professional specialized organizations such as the
 asme  develop standards and regulation codes  for instance  the asme
is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other
with safety  security and design standards 
historically  boilers were a source of many serious injuries and property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles  thin and brittle metal shells can rupture  while poorly welded or riveted seams could open up  leading to a violent eruption of the pressurized steam  when water is converted to steam it expands to over 1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over 100 kilometres per hour  because of this  steam is a great way of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed  but without the right boiler feed water treatment  a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion  at best  this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam  reduced efficiency  shorter plant life and unreliable operation  at worst  it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life  collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute  injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber  extremely large boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can potentially demolish entire buildings 
a boiler that has a loss of feed water and is permitted to boil dry can be extremely dangerous  if feed water is then sent into the empty boiler  the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that cannot be controlled even by safety steam valves  draining of the boiler can also happen if a leak occurs in the steam supply lines that is larger than the make-up water supply could replace  the hartford loop was invented in 1919 by the hartford steam boiler and insurance company as a method to help prevent this condition from occurring  and thereby reduce their insurance claims 
superheated steam boiler  
a superheated boiler on a steam locomotive 
main article 
most boilers produce steam to be used at   that is  saturated steam  superheated steam boilers vaporize the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater  this provides steam at much higher temperature  but can decrease the overall thermal efficiency of the steam generating plant because the higher steam temperature requires a higher flue gas exhaust temperature    there are several ways to circumvent this problem  typically by providing an
that heats the feed water  a combustion air heater in the hot flue gas exhaust path  or both  there are advantages to superheated steam that may  and often will  increase overall efficiency of both steam generation and its utilization  gains in input temperature to a turbine should outweigh any cost in additional boiler complication and expense  there may also be practical limitations in using wet steam  as entrained condensation droplets will damage turbine blades 
superheated steam presents unique safety concerns because  if any system component fails and allows steam to escape  the high pressure and temperature can cause serious  instantaneous harm to anyone in its path  since the escaping steam will initially be completely superheated vapor  detection can be difficult  although the intense heat and sound from such a leak clearly indicates its presence 
superheater operation is similar to that of the coils on an air conditioning unit  although for a different purpose  the steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace  the temperature in this area is typically between 1,300 and 1,600  2,372 and 2,912   some superheaters are radiant type  that is  they absorb heat by radiation  others are convection type  absorbing heat from a fluid  some are a combination of the two types  through either method  the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within  while the temperature of the steam in the superheater rises  the pressure of the steam does not and the pressure remains the same as that of the boiler  almost all steam superheater system designs remove droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and associated piping 
supercritical steam generator  
boiler for a power plant 
main article 
supercritical steam generators are frequently used for the production of   they operate
pressure  in contrast to a  subcritical boiler   a supercritical steam generator operates at such a high pressure  over 3,200psi or 22mpa  that the physical turbulence that characterizes boiling ceases to occur  the fluid is neither liquid nor gas but a super-critical fluid  there is no generation of steam bubbles within the water  because the pressure is above the
point at which steam bubbles can form  as the fluid expands through the turbine stages  its thermodynamic state drops below the critical point as it does work turning the turbine which turns the electrical generator from which power is ultimately extracted  the fluid at that point may be a mix of steam and liquid droplets as it passes into the   this results in slightly less fuel use and therefore less
production  the term  boiler  should not be used for a supercritical pressure steam generator  as no  boiling  actually occurs in this device 
accessories  
boiler fittings and accessories  
to control the steam pressure in the boiler  boilers generally have 2 or 3 pressuretrols  a manual-reset pressuretrol  which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure  the operating pressuretrol  which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure  and for boilers equipped with a modulating burner  a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire 
  it is used to relieve pressure and prevent possible  
water level indicators  they show the operator the level of fluid in the boiler  also known as a  
or water column 
bottom
valves  they provide a means for removing solid particulates that
and lie on the bottom of a boiler  as the name implies  this valve is usually located directly on the bottom of the boiler  and is occasionally opened to use the pressure in the boiler to push these particulates out 
continuous blowdown valve  this allows a small quantity of water to escape continuously  its purpose is to prevent the water in the boiler becoming saturated with dissolved salts  saturation would lead to foaming and cause water droplets to be carried over with the steam  a condition known as   blowdown is also often used to monitor the chemistry of the boiler water 
trycock  a type of
that is often use to manually check a liquid level in a tank  most commonly found on a water boiler 
flash tank  high-pressure blowdown enters this vessel where the steam can  flash  safely and be used in a low-pressure system or be vented to atmosphere while the ambient pressure blowdown flows to drain 
automatic blowdown continuous heat recovery system  this system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler  thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water  no flash tank is generally needed as the blowdown discharged is close to the temperature of the makeup water 
hand holes  they are steel plates installed in openings in  header  to allow for inspections   installation of tubes and inspection of internal surfaces 
steam drum internals  a series of screen  scrubber   cans  cyclone separators  
low-water cutoff  it is a mechanical means  usually a float switch  that is used to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point  if a boiler is  dry-fired   burned without water in it  it can cause rupture or catastrophic failure 
surface blowdown line  it provides a means for removing foam or other lightweight non-condensible substances that tend to float on top of the water inside the boiler 
circulating   it is designed to circulate water back to the boiler after it has expelled some of its heat 
feedwater
or clack valve  a non-return stop valve in the
line  this may be fitted to the side of the boiler  just below the water level  or to the top of the boiler 
top feed  in this design for feedwater injection  the water is fed to the top of the boiler  this can reduce boiler fatigue caused by thermal stress  by spraying the feedwater over a series of trays the water is quickly heated and this can reduce  
desuperheater tubes or bundles  a series of tubes or bundles of tubes in the water drum or the steam drum designed to cool superheated steam  in order to supply auxiliary equipment that does not need  or may be damaged by  dry steam

draught  
a -heated boiler must provide air to oxidize its fuel  early boilers provided this stream of air  or draught  through the natural action of
in a
connected to the exhaust of the combustion chamber  since the heated flue gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler  the flue gas rises in the chimney  pulling denser  fresh air into the combustion chamber 
most modern boilers depend on mechanical draught rather than natural draught  this is because natural draught is subject to outside air conditions and temperature of flue gases leaving the furnace  as well as the chimney height  all these factors make proper draught hard to attain and therefore make mechanical draught equipment much more reliable and economical 
types of draught can also be divided into induced draught  where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler  forced draught  where fresh air is pushed into the boiler  and balanced draught  where both effects are employed  natural draught through the use of a chimney is a type of induced draught  mechanical draught can be induced  forced or balanced 
there are two types of mechanical induced draught  the first is through use of a steam jet  the steam jet oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall draught in the furnace  this method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys  the second method is by simply using an induced draught fan  id fan  which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack  almost all induced draught furnaces operate with a slightly negative pressure 
mechanical forced draught is provided by means of a fan forcing air into the combustion chamber  air is often passed through an air heater  which  as the name suggests  heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler  dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace  forced draught furnaces usually have a positive pressure 
balanced draught is obtained through use of both induced and forced draught  this is more common with larger boilers where the flue gases have to travel a long distance through many boiler passes  the induced draught fan works in conjunction with the forced draught fan allowing the furnace pressure to be maintained slightly below atmospheric
