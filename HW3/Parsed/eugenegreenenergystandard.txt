dismantling  
on 2 february 2009  eugenes general assembly voted in favour of its dismantling  it was agreed that the members and board would continue to work together to promote green energy in europe  but that the eugene standard and the association  asbl  under belgian law would cease to exist 
the standard  
the standard confirmed that energy supplied under the accredited schemes 
is produced from genuinely sustainable energy sources 
will result in a real increase in renewable generation beyond the requirements imposed by government   additionality   
that the demand from consumers is matched by renewable generation 
two variations of the standard   gold  and  silver   differentiated between schemes depending on the additionality of new renewable energy supplied  the development of the standard was aided by the  s clean-e initiative during 2005 and 2006
accredited energy labels  
national energy labels formerly accredited by eugene included 
 
 
the organisation also recommends certain other national schemes that are progressing towards accreditation  including 
 
 
 
there was no eugene accredited scheme in the   the uk s energy regulator    published guidelines in february 2009 that broadly followed the eugene standard  requiring matching and additionality through carbon savings  although allowing the latter to be met through energy efficiency or offsetting  as well as through new renewables schemes  these were implemented in february 2010 in the uk s  
the eugene standard had also been adopted in   while a pilot scheme is in progress in  
the eugene network  
the standard was managed by the eugene network  formerly the european green electricity network   an international membership-based   the network aimed to coordinate and harmonise
labelling nationally and internationally  promote the adoption of the eugene standard as the basis for national and international green   and encourage consumers and suppliers to choose credible
products  formal discussions on the eugene standard first took place in 2000  led by the   and it was officially launched on june 24  2002  the eugene network was legally established in 2003 and the first national energy labels were accredited in 2004 
full voting membership of the network was open to  citizen organisations pursuing not for profit activities with the objectives of promoting green electricity but with no direct interests in the generation and supply of energy services   organisations outside this scope but which do  have a commitment and interest in creating a viable
market  were able to become non-voting associate members or supporters 
as of june 2007  the members of the eugene network were
