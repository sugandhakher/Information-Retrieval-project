use  
utility poles are commonly used to carry two types of electric  
 or  feeders   and subtransmission lines  distribution lines carry power from local
to customers  they generally carry voltages from 4.6 to 33
 kv  for distances up to 30 miles  and include transformers to step the voltage down from the primary voltage to the lower secondary voltage used by the customer  a
carries this lower voltage to the customer s premises 
subtransmission lines carry higher voltage power from regional substations to local substations  they usually carry 46 kv  69 kv  or 115 kv for distances up to 60 miles  230kv lines are often supported on h-shaped towers made with two or three poles 
carrying voltages of above 230kv are usually not supported by poles  but by metal
 known as transmission towers in the us  
for economic or practical reasons  such as to save space in urban areas  a distribution line is often carried on the same poles as a subtransmission line but mounted under the higher voltage lines  a practice called  underbuild   telecommunication cables are usually carried on the same poles that support power lines  poles shared in this fashion are known as joint-use poles  but may have their own dedicated poles 
description  
the standard utility pole in the united states is about 40ft  12m  long and is buried about 6ft  2m  in the ground  however  poles can reach heights of 120ft  37m  or more to satisfy clearance requirements  they are typically spaced about 125ft  38m  apart in urban areas  or about 300ft  91m  in rural areas  but distances vary widely based on terrain  joint-use poles are usually owned by one utility  which leases space on it for other cables  in the united states  the   published by the
 ieee   not to be confused with the
published by the
 nfpa    sets the standards for construction and maintenance of utility poles and their equipment 
pole materials  
steel utility pole in    
most utility poles are made of wood  pressure-treated with some type of
for protection against rot  fungi and insects 
is the most widely used species in the united states  however  many species of long straight trees are used to make utility poles  including         and  
traditionally  the preservative used was   but due to environmental concerns  alternatives such as   copper
and
are becoming widespread in the united states  in the united states  standards for wood preservative materials and wood preservation processes  along with test criteria  are set by     and
 awpa  specifications  despite the preservatives  wood poles decay and have a life of approximately 25 to 50 years depending on climate and soil conditions  therefore requiring regular inspection and remedial preservative treatments 
damage to wood poles is the most significant cause of pole deterioration in the u s 
other common utility pole materials are steel and concrete  with composites  such as   also becoming more prevalent  one particular
utility pole variant used in
is the   made up of two vertical steel posts with a slab of concrete between them 
in southern switzerland along various lakes  telephone poles are made of   starting in the early 1900s  these 18-foot  5 m  poles were originally used for telegraph wires and later for telephone wires  because they are made of granite  the poles last indefinitely

power distribution wires and equipment  
on poles carrying both  the electric
and associated equipment are mounted at the top of the pole above the communication cables  for safety  the vertical space on the pole reserved for this equipment is called the supply space  the wires themselves are usually uninsulated  and supported by   commonly mounted on a horizontal crossarm  power is transmitted using the
system  with three wires  or phases  labeled  a    b   and  c  
subtransmission lines comprise only these 3 wires  plus sometimes an overhead ground wire  ogw   also called a  static line  or a  neutral   suspended above them  the ogw acts like a lightning rod  providing a low
path to ground thus protecting the phase conductors from lightning 
a joint-use utility pole in  
distribution lines use two systems  either grounded-wye   y  on   or delta  greek letter
on electrical schematics   a delta system requires only a conductor for each of the three phases  a grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor  the   whose source is the center of the  y  and is grounded  however   spur lines  branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires  plus the neutral  a wide range of standard distribution voltages are used  from 2,400 v to 34,500 v  on poles near a   there is a cylindrical
to provide the required   usually 240/120 v
for residential and light commercial service in the   the transformer s primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called   in the event of an overload  the fuse melts and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem  they can also be opened manually by
using a long insulated rod called a
to disconnect the transformer from the line 
single-phase
with
secondary for    service  note use of a
as one leg of the primary feeder 
the pole may be
with a heavy bare
or
wire running down the pole  attached to the metal pin supporting each insulator  and at the bottom connected to a metal rod driven into the ground  some countries ground every pole while others only ground every fifth pole and any pole with a transformer on it  this provides a path for leakage currents across the surface of the insulators to get to ground  preventing the current from flowing through the wooden pole which could cause a fire or shock hazard  it provides similar protection in case of
and lightning strikes  a
 also called a lightning arrester  may also be installed between the line  ahead of the cutout  and the ground wire for lightning protection  the purpose of the device is to conduct extremely high voltages present on the line directly to ground 
if uninsulated conductors touch due to wind or fallen trees  the resultant sparks can start   to reduce this problem 
are being introduced 
communication cables  
the communications cables are attached below the electric power lines  in a vertical space along the pole designated the communications space  the communications space is separated from the lowest electrical conductor by the communication worker safety zone  which provides room for workers to maneuver safely while servicing the communication cables  avoiding contact with the power lines 
the most common communication cables found on utility poles are copper or
 foc  for
and
for
 catv   coaxial or optical fibre cables linking
are also increasingly found on poles in urban areas  the cable linking the
to local customers is a thick cable lashed to a thin supporting cable  containing hundreds of
  each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or
to a customer  there may also be fibre optic cables interconnecting telephone exchanges  like electrical distribution lines  communication cables connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers 
other equipment  
utility poles may also carry other equipment such as   supports for
and overhead
wires  and
antennas  they can also carry fixtures and decorations specific for certain holidays or events specific to the city where they are located 
solar panels mounted on utility poles may power auxiliary equipment where the expense of a power line connection is unwanted 
streetlights and holiday fixtures are powered directly from secondary distribution 
pole attachment hardware  
standard arrangement for telephone poles
the primary purpose of pole attachment hardware is to secure the cable and associated aerial plant facilities to poles and to help facilitate necessary plant rearrangements  an aerial plant network requires high-quality reliable hardware to
structurally support the distribution cable plant
provide directional guying to accommodate lateral stresses created on the pole by pole line configurations and pole loading configuration
provide the physical support and protection for drop cable plant from the pole to the customer premises
transition cable plant from the aerial network to underground and buried plant
provide the means for safe and effective grounding  bonding  and isolation connections for the metallic and dielectric components of the network 
functional performance requirements common to pole line hardware for utility poles made of wood  steel  concrete  or fiber-reinforced composite  frc  materials are contained in telcordia gr-3174  generic requirements for hardware attachments for utility poles 
attachment hardware by pole type  
wood poles
the traditional wood pole material provides great flexibility during placement of hardware and cable apparatus  holes are easily drilled to fit the exact hardware needs and requirements  in addition  fasteners such as lags and screws are easily applied to wood structures to support
 osp  apparatus 
non-wood poles
there are three main non-wood pole materials and structures on which the attachment hardware may be mounted  concrete  steel  and fiber-reinforced composite  frc   each material has intrinsic characteristics that need to be considered during the design and manufacture of the attachment hardware 
concrete poles
the most widespread use of concrete poles is in
and coastal zones where excellent corrosion resistance is required to reduce the impact of sea water  salt fog  and corrosive soil conditions  e g   marsh   their heavy weight also helps the concrete poles resist the high winds possible in coastal areas 
the various designs for concrete poles include tapered structures and round poles made of solid concrete  pre-stressed concrete  spun-cast or statically cast   and a hybrid of concrete and steel 
the drilling of installed concrete poles is not feasible  users may wish to have the attachment hardware cast into the concrete during the pole manufacture  as a result of these operational difficulties  banded hardware has become the more popular means to attach cable plant to concrete poles 
design criteria and requirements for concrete poles can be derived from various industry documents including  but not limited to  asce-111  aci-318  astm c935  and astm c1089 
steel poles
steel poles can provide advantages for high-voltage lines  where taller poles are required for enhanced clearances and longer span requirements  tubular steel poles are typically made from 11-gauge galvanized steel  with thicker 10- or 7-gauge materials used for some taller poles because of their higher strength and rigidity  for tall tower-type structures  5-gauge materials are used 
although steel poles can be drilled on-site with a
drill bit or standard twist drill  it is not a recommended practice  as with concrete poles  bolt holes could be built into the steel pole during manufacture for use as general attachment points or places for steps to be bolted into the pole 
welding of attachment hardware or attachment ledges to steel poles may be a feasible alternate approach to help provide reliable attachment points  however  operational and practical hazards of welding in the field may make this process undesirable or uneconomical 
steel poles should meet industry specifications such as  tia eia-222-g  structural standard for antenna supporting structures and antennas  current   tia eia-222  structural standards for steel  and tia eia-rs-222  or an equivalent requirement set to help ensure a robust and good quality pole is being used 
fiber-reinforced composite  frc  poles
frc poles cover a family of pole materials that combine fiberglass  fiber  strength members with a cross-linked polyester resin and a variety of chemical additives to produce a lightweight  weather-resistant structure  frc poles are hollow and similar to the tubular steel poles  with a typical wall thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch with an outer polyurethane coating that is  0.002-inch thin 
as with all the other non-wood poles  frc poles cannot be mounted with the traditional climbing hardware of hooks and gaffs  frc poles can be pre-drilled by the manufacturer  or holes can be drilled on site  attachments using lag bolts  teeth  nails  and staples are unacceptable for frc poles  through-bolts are used instead of lag bolts for maximum bonding to the pole and to avoid loosening of hardware 
the relevant industry documents covering frc poles include  astm d4923  ansi c136.20  opcs-03-02  and telcordia gr-3159  generic requirements for fiber-reinforced composite  frc   concrete  and steel utility poles 
access  
in some countries  such as the united kingdom  utility poles have sets of brackets arranged in a standard pattern up the pole to act as hand and foot holds so that maintenance and repair workers can climb the pole to work on the lines  in the united states  such steps have been determined to be a public hazard and are no longer allowed on new poles    linemen may use climbing spikes called gaffs to ascend wooden poles without steps on them  in the uk  boots fitted with steel loops that go around the pole  known as  scandinavian climbers   are also used for climbing poles  in the us  linemen use

example of dead-end riser poles
the poles at the end of a straight section of utility line where the line ends or angles off in another direction are called dead-end poles in the united states  elsewhere they may be referred to as anchor or termination poles  these must carry the lateral
of the long straight sections of wire  they are usually made with heavier construction  the power lines are attached to the pole by horizontal strain insulators  either placed on crossarms  which are either doubled  tripled  or replaced with a steel crossarm  to provide more resistance to the tension forces  or attached directly to the pole itself 
dead-end and other poles that support lateral loads have
to support them  the guys always have
inserted in their length to prevent any high voltages caused by electrical faults from reaching the lower portion of the cable that is accessible by the public  in populated areas  guy wires are often encased in a yellow plastic or wood tube reflector attached to their lower end  so that they can be seen more easily  reducing the chance of people and animals walking into them or vehicles crashing into them 
another means of providing support for lateral loads is a push brace pole  a second shorter pole that is attached to the side of the first and runs at an angle to the ground  if there is no space for a lateral support  a stronger pole  e g  a construction of concrete or iron  is used 
history  
in 1844  the united states
granted
 30,000 to build a 40-mile
line between  
and
morse began by having a lead-sheathed cable made  after laying seven miles underground  he tested it  he found so many faults with this system that he dug up his cable  stripped off its sheath  bought poles and strung his wires overhead  on february 7  1844  morse inserted the following advertisement in the washington newspaper   sealed proposals will be received by the undersigned for furnishing 700 straight and sound chestnut posts with the bark on and of the following dimensions to wit   each post must not be less than eight inches in diameter at the butt and tapering to five or six inches at the top  six hundred and eighty of said posts to be 24 feet in length  and 20 of them 30 feet in length

lines was the washington dcnorfolk line which was  for the most part  square-sawn tapered poles of
probably treated to refusal with    treated to refusal  means that the manufacturer forces preservatives into the wood  until it refuses to accept more  but performance is not guaranteed  some of these were still in service after 80 years  the building of pole lines was resisted in some urban areas in the late 19th century  and political pressure for
remains powerful in many countries 
in     and third world countries  many utility poles still carry bare communication wires mounted on insulators not only along railway lines  but also along roads and sometimes even in urban areas  errant traffic being uncommon on railways  their poles are usually less tall  in the united states electricity is predominately carried on unshielded
conductors wound around a solid steel core and affixed to rated insulators made from glass  ceramic  or poly  telephone  catv  and fibre optic cables are generally attached directly to the pole without insulators 
in the   much of the rural electricity distribution system is carried on wooden poles  these normally carry electricity at 11 or 33 kv  three phases  from 132 kv substations supplied from
to distribution substations or pole-mounted transformers  wooden poles have been used for 132kv for a number of years from the early 1980s one is called the trident they are usually used on short sections  though the line from melbourne  cambs to near buntingford  herts is quite long  the conductors on these are bare metal connected to the posts by insulators  wood poles can also be used for
distribution to customers 
poles in    
today  utility poles may hold much more than the uninsulated copper wire that they originally supported  thicker cables holding many     or even   may be carried  simple analogue
or other
equipment have long been mounted against poles  and often new digital equipment for  demultiplexing or digital repeaters may now be seen  in many places  as seen in the illustration  providers of electricity  television  telephone  street light  traffic signal and other services share poles  either in joint ownership or by renting space to each other  in the united states  ansi standard 05.1.2008 governs wood pole sizes and strength loading  utilities that fall under the
must also follow the guidelines set forth in rus bulletin 1724e-150  from the us department of agriculture  for pole strength and loading 
steel utility poles are becoming more prevalent in the united states thanks to improvements in engineering and corrosion prevention coupled with lowered production costs  however  premature failure due to corrosion is a concern when compared to wood

brandings on a pole in   united states 
in the united states  utility poles are marked with information concerning the manufacturer  pole height  ansi strength class  wood species  original preservative  and year manufactured  vintage  in accordance with ansi standard o5.1.2008  this is called branding  as it is usually burned into the surface  the resulting mark is sometimes called the  birth mark   although the position of the brand is determined by ansi specification  it is essentially just below  eye level  after installation  a rule of thumb for understanding a pole s brand is the manufacturer s name or logo at the top with a 2-digit date beneath  sometimes preceded by a month  
below the date is a 2-character wood species abbreviation and 1- to 3-character preservative  some wood species may be  sp  for southern pine   wc  for western cedar  and  df  for douglas fir  common preservative abbreviations are  c  for    p  for   and  sk  for
 originally referred to salts type k   the next line of the brand is usually the pole s ansi class  used to determine maximum load  this number ranges from 10 to h6 with a smaller number meaning higher strength  the pole s height  from butt to top  in 5-foot increments is usually to the right of the class separated by a hyphen  although it is not uncommon for older brands to have the height on a separate line  the pole brand is sometimes an aluminum tag nailed in place 
before the practice of branding  many utilities would set a 2- to 4-digit date nail into the pole upon installation  the use of date nails went out of favor during world war ii due to war shortages but is still used by a few utilities  these nails are considered valuable to collectors  with older dates being more valuable  and unique markings such as the utilities  name also increasing the value  however  regardless of the value to collectors  all attachments on a utility pole are the property of the utility company  and unauthorized removal is a felony   
coordinates on pole tags

used in geometry  x increases as one travels east and y increases as one travels north  the upper two tags are specific to the subtransmission section of the pole  the first refers to the route number  the second to the specific pole along the route 
however  not all power lines follow the road  in the british region of  
networks often add the
grid reference coordinates of the pole or substation to the name sign

pole route  
telegraph pole with spars  insulators and open wires on a now decommissioned railway pole route  eccles road     
a pole route  or pole line in the us  is a telephone link or electrical power line between two or more locations by way of multiple uninsulated wires suspended between wooden utility poles  this method of link is common especially in rural areas where burying the cables would be expensive  another situation in which pole routes were extensively used were on the railways to link   traditionally  prior to around 1965  pole routes were built with open wires along non-electrical operated railways  this necessitated insulation when the wire passed over the pole  thus preventing the signal from becoming attenuated 
at electrical operated railways  pole routes were usually not built as too much jamming from the overhead wire would occur  to accomplish this  cables were separated using spars with insulators spaced along them  in general four insulators were used per spar  only one such pole route still exists on the uk rail network  in the highlands of   there was also a long section in place between
