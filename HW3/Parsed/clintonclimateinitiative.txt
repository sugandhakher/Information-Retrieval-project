history
the origins of the foundation go back to 1997  when then-president
was focused mostly on
for the future
in  
former
bill founded the william j  clinton foundation in 2001 following the completion of his presidency  longtime clinton advisor
became the ceo in 2004  later  lindsey moved from being ceo to being chair  largely for health reasons  other clinton hands who played an important early role included
and   additional clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include
and laura graham 
most of the foundation s successes came from bill s worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives  celebrities  and government officials  similarly  the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever bill suddenly felt an interest in 
preceding  s 2009 nomination of hillary clinton as   bill clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the clinton presidential center and the clinton global initiative  accordingly  a list of donors was released in december 2008 
by 2011 
was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board  to raise money for the foundation  she gave paid speeches  such as her  65,000 2014 address at the
in kansas city for the opening of the starr women s hall of fame 
in 2013  hillary clinton joined the foundation following her   she planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children  as well as economic development  accordingly  at that point  it was renamed the  bill  hillary   chelsea clinton foundation   extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the

in midtown manhattan 
chelsea clinton moved the organization to an outside review  conducted by the firm of   its conclusions were made public in mid-2013  the main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president s fundraising abilities  how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization  and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond bill clinton s lifetime    a former hillary clinton campaign official and state department deputy chief  was named to oversee a  250 million endowment drive  the review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements  including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities  additionally  the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation s conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process 
in january 2015  braverman announced his resignation 
attributed the move to being  partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation   he was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary  maura pally

in august 2016  s editorial board suggested that the clinton foundation cease accepting donations  the globe s editorial board offered praise for the foundation s work but added that  as long as either of the clintons are in public office  or actively seeking it  they should not operate a charity  too  because it represents a conflict of interest and a political distraction 
in 2016  the
wire news service reported that the clinton foundation suspected that it had been the target of a   as a consequence of the suspected cyber security breach  clinton foundation officials retained a security firm    to evaluate its data systems  the cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with cyberattacks that targeted other institutions  such as the

and
in 2005  shortly after hurricane katrina hit  president
asked former presidents
and bill clinton to raise funds to help rebuild the

transparency
around 2007  the clinton foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency  although u s  law did not require nonprofit charities  including presidential foundations  to disclose the identities of their contributors  critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because hillary was   commentator
wrote in a
op-ed that the clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance of impropriety 
secretary of state clinton meets with
emir   21 september 2010
a lengthy donors list was then released by the foundation in december 2008  which included several politically sensitive donors  such as the
and   the foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that  not even the appearance of a conflict of interest  would exist once hillary clinton was secretary of state  in november 2016  the reuters reported that  the clinton foundation has confirmed it accepted a  1 million gift from
while hillary clinton was u s  secretary of state without informing the state department  even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments   conservative columnist
opined that the qatari gift  raised ethical questions  because of the nation s support for  
the ethics agreement between the state department and the clinton foundation that was put into force at the beginning of the secretary of state clinton s tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during february 2015  a
report found that the clinton foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once secretary clinton s tenure had ended  contributions from foreign donors who are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the u s  constitute a major portion of the foundation s income  the foundation s chief communications officer craig minassian explained that it is a  false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldnt also support philanthropic work   a
inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the clinton foundation during the secretary s tenure found six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before clinton became secretary  which was permissible under the agreement  but also one instance of a new donation   500,000 from algeria for earthquake relief in haiti  that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review  but did not  foundation officials said that if the former secretary decided to run for president in 2016  they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations  but in general  they stressed that   as with other global charities  we rely on the support of individuals  organizations  corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way  when anyone contributes to the clinton foundation  it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives   state department spokesperson
attested that the foundation s commitment to the ethics agreement in question  has been over and above the letter of the law   in august 2016  with less than 90 days before the upcoming presidential election  the clinton foundation announced that it will stop accepting foreign donations if clinton is elected 
in march 2015 
reported that the clinton foundation had broken its promise to publish all of its donors  as well as its promise to let the
review all of its donations from foreign governments  in april 2015  the
reported that when hillary clinton was secretary of state  the state department had approved a deal to sell american uranium to a russian state-owned enterprise
whose chairman had donated to the clinton foundation  and that clinton had broken her promise to publicly identify such donations  the state department  was one of nine government agencies  not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators  that had to sign off on the deal  
notes that there is  no evidence  that the donations influenced clintons official actions or that she was involved in the state department s decision to approve the deal  and
concluded that any  suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated  
2015 state department subpoena
in february 2016 
reported that the
issued a
to the foundation in the fall of 2015  according to the report  the subpoena focused on  documents about the charity s projects that may have required approval from federal government during hillary clinton s term as secretary of state  and  also asked for records related to   longtime clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the state department  the foundation  clinton s personal office  and a private consulting firm with ties to the clintons  
private philanthropy
the clinton foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate  due to their similar names  the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the clinton family foundation  which is reserved for the clintons  private philanthropy  the two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources  the significantly smaller clinton family foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving  headquartered in chappaqua  new york  it received nearly all of the approximately  14 million the clintons gave to charity from 200713
