background  
the history of the sdgs can be traced to 1972 when governments met under in stockholm  sweden  for the
  to consider the rights of the human family to a healthy and productive environment  it was not until 1983 that the united nations decided to create the world commission on environment and development which defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs   in 1992 the first
was held in rio  it was here that the first agenda for environment and development was developed and adopted  also known as agenda 21 
twenty years later  at the
conference  a resolution  known as the future we want was reached by member states  among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication  energy  water and sanitation  health  and human settlement  paragraph 246 of the future we want outcome document forms the link between the
agreement and the    we recognize that the development of goals could also be useful for pursuing focused and coherent action on sustainable development  the goals should address and incorporate in a balanced way all three dimensions of sustainable development  environment  economics  and society  and their interlinkages  the development of these goals should not divert focus or effort from the achievement of the millennium development goals   paragraph 249 states that  the process needs to be coordinated and coherent with the processes to consider the post-2015 development agenda  
taken together  these two paragraphs paved the way to bring together the development agenda centered on the millennium development goals  mdgs   which were officially established following the
of the united nations in 2000  and the agreement under the future we want outcome document  the rio 20 summit also agreed that the process of designing sustainable development goals  should be  action-oriented  concise and easy to communicate  limited in number  aspirational  global in nature and universally applicable to all countries while taking into account different national realities  capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities  
the mdgs were supposed to be achieved by 2015  a further process was needed to agree and develop development goals from 2015-2030  discussion on the post-2015 framework for international development began well in advance  with the united nations system task team on post 2015 development agenda releasing the first report known as realizing the future we want  the report was the first attempt to achieve the requirements under paragraph 246 and 249 of the future we want document  it identified four dimensions as part of a global vision for sustainable development  inclusive social development  environmental sustainability  inclusive economic development  and peace and security  other processes included the un secretary general s high level panel on post 2015 development agenda  whose report was submitted to the secretary general in 2013 
the goals  
further information 
on 25 september 2015  the 193 countries of the un general assembly adopted the 2030 development agenda titled transforming our world  the 2030 agenda for sustainable development  following the adoption  un agencies  under the umbrella of the   decided to support a campaign by several independent entities  among them corporate institutions and international organizations  the campaign  known as project everyone  introduced the term global goals and is intended to help communicate the agreed sustainable development goals to a wider constituency  however the decision to support what is an independent campaign  without the approval of the member states  has met resistance from several sections of civil society and governments  who accuse the undg of ignoring the most important communication aspect of the agreement  sustainability  there are also concerns that global goals is a term used to refer to several other processes that are not related to the united nations 
the official agenda for sustainable development adopted on 25 september 2015 has 92 paragraphs  with the main paragraph  51  outlining the 17 sustainable development goals and its associated 169 targets  this included the following goals

no poverty - end
in all its forms everywhere
extreme poverty has been cut by more than half since 1990- however  more than 1 in 5 people live on less than  1.25 a day
poverty is more than lack of income or resources- it includes lack of basic services  such as education  hunger  social discrimination and exclusion  and lack or participation in decision making 
gender inequality plays a large role in the perpetuation of poverty and it s risks  they then face potentially life-threatening risks from early pregnancy  and often lost hopes for an education and a better income 
age groups are affected differently when struck with poverty  its most devastating effects are on children  to whom it poses a great threat  it affects their education  health  nutrition and security  it also negatively affects the emotional  spiritual and emotional development of children through the environment it creates 
zero hunger -   achieve
and improved nutrition and promote
globally  1 in 9 people are undernourished  the vast majority of these people live in developing countries
agriculture is the single largest employer in the world  providing livelihoods for 40 per cent of todays global population  it is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households  women comprise on average 43 per cent of the agricultural labor force in developing countries  and over 50 per cent in parts of asia and africa  yet they only own 20  of the land 
poor nutrition causes nearly half  45 per cent  of deaths in children under five  3.1 million children each year 
good health and well-being - ensure healthy lives and promote
for all at all ages
significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality  and major progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation  reducing malaria  tuberculosis  polio and the spread of hiv aids 
however  only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need  and the need for family planning in increasing exponentially  while the need met is growing slowly- more than 225 million women have an unmet need for contraception 
an important target is to substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from  
quality education - ensure
and
quality education and promote
opportunities for all
major progress has been made for education access  specifically at the primary school level  for both boys and girls  however  access does not always mean quality of education  or completion of primary school  currently  103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills  and more than 60 per cent of them are women
target 1  by 2030  ensure that all girls and boys complete free  equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and goal-4 effective learning outcomes - shows the commitment to nondiscriminatory education outcomes
gender equality - achieve
and
all women and girls
providing women and girls with equal access to education  health care  decent work  and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large
while a record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions by 2014  another 52 had not taken this step  in many nations  gender discrimination is still woven through legal and social norms
though goal 5 is the gender equality stand-alone goal- the sdg s can only be successful if women are completely integrated into each and every goal
clean water and sanitation - ensure
and sustainable management of water and
for all
affordable and clean energy - ensure access to affordable  reliable 
and modern energy for all
decent work and economic growth - promote sustained  inclusive and   full and productive employment and
for all
industry  innovation and infrastructure - build
  promote inclusive and
and foster
reduced inequalities - reduce income
within and among countries
sustainable cities and communities - make cities and human settlements inclusive  safe  resilient and sustainable
responsible consumption and production - ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
climate action - take urgent action to combat
and its impacts by regulating emissions and promoting developments in renewable energy
life below water -
and sustainably use the oceans  seas and
for sustainable development
life on land - protect  restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial   sustainably manage forests  combat   and halt and reverse
and halt
loss
peace  justice and strong institutions - promote peaceful and inclusive societies for   provide
for all and build effective  accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
partnerships for the goals - strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for
as of august 2015  there were 169 proposed targets for these goals and 304 proposed indicators to show compliance 
post-2015 development agenda process  
since rio 20 did not elaborate specific goals  a 30-member open working group  owg  was established on 22 january 2013 by the decision of the un general assembly  the owg was tasked with preparing a proposal on the sdgs for consideration during the 68th session of the general assembly  september 2013  september 2014 
the open working group used a constituency-based system of representation  which meant that most of the seats in the working group are shared by several countries  after 13 sessions  the owg submitted their proposal of 17 sdgs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the un general assembly in september  2014 
the rio 20 outcome document stated that  at the outset  the owg will decide on its methods of work  including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society  the scientific community and the united nations system in its work  in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience 
critique  
a report by the international
 ifpri  of 2013 criticized the efforts of the sdgs as not ambitious enough  instead of aiming for an end to poverty by 2030  the report  an ambitious development goal  ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025  calls for a greater emphasis on eliminating hunger and undernutrition and achieving that in 5 years less  by 2025  it bases its claims on an analysis of the experiences from china  vietnam  brazil and thailand and identifies 3 pathways to achieving this goal  agriculture-led  social protection and nutrition interventionled  or a combination of both of these approaches 
the sdgs have been criticized for being contradictory  because in seeking high levels of global   they will undermine their own
objectives  it has also been noted that  in relation to the headline goal of eliminating extreme poverty   a growing number of scholars are pointing out that  1.25 is actually not adequate for human    and the poverty line should be revised to as high as  5 
a commentary in
argued that the 169 targets for the sdgs are too many  calling them  sprawling    misconceived   and  a mess  compared to the   it also criticised the goals for ignoring local context and promoting  cookie-cutter development policies   they claimed that all other sustainable development goals are founded on achieving sdg number one  the economist estimated that trying to alleviate poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about us 2 trillion to 3 trillion per annum for the next 15 years  which critics do not see as being feasible  the reduction in the number of people living in abject poverty has been criticized as a result of the growth of china  the mdgs have been mistakenly credited for this drop  the sdgs have also been criticized due to the inherent shortcomings in the very concept of sustainable development and the inability of the latter to either stabilize rising carbon dioxide concentration or ensure environmental harmony 
intersectoral linkages  
water  sanitation  and hygiene  
experts have stated that without progress on goal 6  the other goals and targets will not be able to be achieved 
climate change  
nations and other parties negotiating at the un have highlighted the links between the post-2015 sdg process  the
process to be concluded in addis ababa in july 2015  and the
climate change conference in paris in december 2015 
in may 2015  a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in paris in 2015 will enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets  the report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the sdgs are met  and that development and climate are inextricably linked  particularly around poverty  gender equality  and energy  the un encourages the public sector to take initiative in this effort for minimizing negative impacts on the environment 
women and gender equality  
despite stand-alone goals on health  gender equality and education  among others  there is widespread consensus that progress against any and all of the sdgs will be stalled if women s empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized  arguments and evidence from sources as diverse and as economically oriented as the oecd  to expected sources such as un women  bolster the case that investments in women and girls impact national and global development in ways that exceed their initial scope of interest 
economic growth and infrastructure  
development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment werent addressed properly and prioritized as they should be  more worryingly  work and economic growth and technological innovation and infrastructure investment joined the  sdgs  priority list at n8 and n9 respectively  a rather mediocre ranking which dees economic common sense
