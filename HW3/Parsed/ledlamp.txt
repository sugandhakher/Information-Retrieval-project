like incandescent lamps and unlike most fluorescent lamps  e g  tubes and
or cfls   leds come to full brightness without need for a warm-up time  the life of fluorescent lighting is also reduced by frequent switching on and off  the initial cost of led is usually higher  degradation of led dye and packaging materials reduces light output to some extent over time 
some led lamps are made to be a directly compatible drop-in replacement for incandescent or fluorescent lamps  an led lamp packaging may show the

most leds do not emit light in all directions  and their directional characteristics affect the design of lamps  although omnidirectional lamps which radiate light over a 360 angle are becoming more common  the
of single led is less than that of incandescent and compact fluorescent lamps  in most applications multiple leds are used to form a lamp  although high-power versions  see below  are becoming available 
led chips need controlled
 dc  electrical power and an appropriate
as an led driver is required to convert the
from the power supply to the regulated voltage direct current used by the leds  leds are adversely affected by high temperature  so led lamps typically include
elements such as
and  
led drivers are the essential components of led lamps or luminaries  a good led driver can guarantee a long life for an led system and provide additional features such as dimming and control  the led drivers can be put inside lamp or luminaire  which is called a built-in type  or be put outside  which is called an independent type  according to different applications  different types of led drivers need to be applied  for example an outdoor driver for street light  an indoor point driver for a down light  and an indoor linear driver for a panel light

history  
before electric lighting became common in the early 20th century  people used candles  gas lights  oil lamps  and fires  humphry davy developed the first incandescent light in 1802  followed by the first practical
in 1806  by the 1870s  davy s arc lamp had been successfully commercialized  and was used to light many public spaces  the development of a steadily glowing filament suitable for interior lighting took longer  but by the early twentieth century inventors had successfully developed options  replacing the arc light with incandescents 
the first leds were developed in the early 1960s  however  they were low-powered and only produced light in the low  red frequencies of the spectrum  the first high-brightness blue led was demonstrated by
of
in 1994  the existence of blue leds and high-efficiency leds led to the development of the first  white led   which employed a phosphor coating to partially convert the emitted blue light to red and green frequencies creating a light that appears white   
and nakamura were later awarded the 2014
for the invention of the blue led 
in the usa  the energy independence and security act  eisa  of 2007 authorized the
 doe  to establish the
competition  known as the  l prize   the first government-sponsored technology competition designed to challenge industry to develop replacements for 60 w
and
halogen lamps  the eisa legislation established basic requirements and prize amounts for each of the two competition categories  and authorized up to  20 million in cash prizes  the competition also included the possibility for winners to obtain federal purchasing agreements  utility programs  and other incentives  in may 2008  they announced details of the competition and technical requirements for each category  lighting products meeting the competition requirements could use just 17  of the energy used by most incandescent lamps in use today  that same year the doe also launched the energy star program for solid-state lighting products  the eisa legislation also authorized an additional l prize program for developing a new  21st century lamp  
philips lighting ceased research on compact fluorescents in 2008 and began devoting the bulk of its research and development budget to solid-state lighting  on 24 september 2009 
lighting north america became the first to submit lamps in the category to replace the standard 60 w a-19   fixture  light bulb  with a design based on their earlier  ambientled  consumer product  on 3 august 2011  doe awarded the prize in the 60 w replacement category to a philips  led lamp after 18 months of extensive testing 
early led lamps varied greatly in
from the incandescent lamps they were replacing  a standard was developed  ansi c78.377-2008  that specified the recommended color ranges for solid-state lighting products using cool to warm white leds with various correlated color temperatures  in june 2008 
announced the first two standards for solid-state lighting in the united states  these standards detail performance specifications for led light sources and prescribe test methods for solid-state lighting products 
also in 2008 in the united states and canada  the
program began to label lamps that meet a set of standards for starting time  life expectancy  color  and consistency of performance  the intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns due to variable quality of products  by providing transparency and standards for the labeling and usability of products available in the market 
is a resource for finding and comparing energy star qualified lamps  a similar program in the
 run by the   was launched to identify lighting products that meet energy conservation and performance guidelines 
the illuminating engineering society of north america  iesna  in 2008 published a documentary standard lm-79  which describes the methods for testing solid-state lighting products for their light output  lumens   efficacy  lumens per watt  and chromaticity 
in january 2009  it was reported that researchers at
had developed an led bulb that costs 2  about  3 u s    is 12 times as energy efficient as a tungsten bulb  and lasts for 100,000 hours  honeywell electrical devices and systems  ed s  recommend worldwide usage of led lighting as it is energy efficient and can help save the climate 
as of 2016  in the opinion of noah horowitz of the   new standards proposed by the
would likely mean most light bulbs used in the future would be led 
examples of early adoption  
leds as christmas illumination in
in 2008 sentry equipment corporation in     us  was able to light its new factory interior and exterior almost solely with leds  initial cost was three times that of a traditional mix of incandescent and fluorescent lamps  but the extra cost was recovered within two years via electricity savings  and the lamps should not need replacing for 20 years  in 2009 the manapakkam 
office of the indian it company  igate  spent 3,700,000  80,000  to light 57,000sqft  5,300m2  of office space with leds  the firm expected the new lighting to pay for itself fully within 5 years 
in 2009 the exceptionally large christmas tree standing in front of the
in
was hung with 710 led bulbs  each using 2 watts  it has been calculated that these led lamps paid for themselves in three and a half years  even though the lights run for only 48 days per year 
in 2009 a new highway  a29  was inaugurated in     it included the first european public led-based lighting highway 
by 2010 mass installations of led lighting for commercial and public uses were becoming common  led lamps were used for a number of demonstration projects for outdoor lighting and   the
made several reports available on the results of many pilot projects for municipal outdoor lighting  and many additional streetlight and municipal outdoor lighting projects soon followed 
technology overview  
general-purpose lighting needs white light  leds emit light in a very narrow band of wavelengths  emitting light of a color characteristic of the energy
of the
material used to make the led  to emit white light from leds requires either mixing light from leds of various colors  or using a
to convert some of the light to other colors 
the two simplest methods of producing white light leds are rgb or phosphor 
or
white leds uses multiple led chips emitting red  green  and blue wavelengths  these outputs combine to produce white light  the
 cri  is poor  typically 25 - 65  due to the narrow range of wavelengths emitted 
the second basic method uses leds in conjunction with a phosphor to produce
from a single led  the most common method is to combine a blue led with a yellow phosphor  producing a narrow range of blue wavelengths and a broad band of  yellow  wavelengths actually covering the spectrum from green to red  the cri value can range from less than 70 to over 90  although a wide range of commercial leds of this type have a color rendering index around 82 
the colors available from both the basic types of white light led is adjustable to a certain extent  with
in the range of 2,200 k  matching incandescent lamps  up to 7,000 k are widely available  higher cri values can be obtained using more than three led colors to cover a greater range of wavelengths  tunable lighting systems employ banks of colored leds that can be individually controlled  either using separate banks of each color  or multi-chip leds with the colors combined and controlled at the chip level 
application  
a significant difference from other light sources is that the light is more directional  i e   emitted as a narrower beam  led lamps are used for both general and special-purpose lighting  where colored light is needed  leds that inherently emit light of a single color require no energy-absorbing filters 
illumination with color mixing led fixtures
computer-led led lighting allows enhancement of unique qualities of paintings in the
in
white-light led lamps have longer life expectancy and higher efficiency  more light for the same electricity  than most other lighting when used at the proper temperature  led sources are compact  which gives flexibility in designing lighting fixtures and good control over the distribution of light with small reflectors or lenses  because of the small size of leds  control of the spatial distribution of illumination is extremely flexible  and the light output and spatial distribution of an led array can be controlled with no efficiency loss 
leds using the color-mixing principle can emit a wide range of colors by changing the proportions of light generated in each primary color  this allows full color mixing in lamps with leds of different colors  unlike other lighting technologies  led emission tends to be directional  or at least    which can be either advantageous or disadvantageous  depending on requirements  for applications where non-directional light is required  either a diffuser is used  or multiple individual led emitters are used to emit in different directions 
effects on plants  
experiments unraveled surprising performance and production of vegetables and ornamental plants under led light sources  a large number of plant species have been assessed in greenhouse trials to make sure plants have higher quality in biomass and biochemical ingredients even higher or comparable with field conditions  plant performance of mint  basil  lentil  lettuce  cabbage  parsley  carrot were measured by assessing health and vigor of plants and success in promoting growth  promoting in profuse flowering of select ornamentals including primula  marigold  stock were also noticed 
light emitting diodes  leds  have efficient electric lighting with desired wavelengths  red blue  which support greenhouse production in a minimum time and with high quality and quantity  as leds are cool it helps plants to be placed as close as possible to light sources without overheating or scorching  this will save a high amount of space for intense cultivation 
household led lamps  
replacement for existing lighting  
disassembled led-light bulb with driver circuit board and edison screw
lamp sizes and bases  
led lamps are made of arrays of
that replace incandescent or compact fluorescent light bulbs  mostly replacing incandescent bulbs rated from 5 to 60 watts  such lamps are made with standard
connections and shapes  such as an
base  an
shape with a bi-pin base  or a
 bi-pin cap  or
 bayonet fitting  and are made compatible with the voltage supplied to the sockets  they include driver circuitry to rectify the ac power and convert the voltage to an appropriate value  usually  
as of 2010 some led lamps replaced higher wattage bulbs  for example  one manufacturer claimed a 16-watt led bulb was as bright as a 150w halogen lamp  a standard general-purpose incandescent bulb emits light at an efficiency of about 14 to 17 lumens w depending on its size and voltage  according to the european union standard  an energy-efficient bulb that claims to be the equivalent of a 60w tungsten bulb must have a minimum light output of 806 lumens 
a selection of consumer led bulbs available in 2012 as drop-in replacements for incandescent bulbs in screw-type sockets
some models of led bulbs are compatible with
as used for incandescent lamps  led lamps often have directional light characteristics  these bulbs are more power-efficient than compact fluorescent bulbs and offer lifespans of 30,000 or more hours  reduced if operated at a higher temperature than specified  incandescent bulbs have a typical life of 1,000 hours  and compact fluorescents about 8,000 hours  the bulbs maintain output light intensity well over their lifetimes  energy star specifications require the bulbs to typically drop less than 10  after 6,000 or more hours of operation  and in the worst case not more than 15   led lamps are available with a variety of color properties  the purchase price is higher than most other  but the higher efficiency may make total cost of ownership  purchase price plus cost of electricity and changing bulbs  lower 
high-power led  corn cob  light bulb
several companies offer led lamps for general lighting purposes  the technology is improving rapidly and new energy-efficient consumer led lamps are available 
led lamps are close to being adopted as the mainstream light source because of the falling prices and because 40 and 60 watt
bulbs are being phased out  in the u s  the
effectively bans the manufacturing and importing of most current incandescent light bulbs  led bulbs have decreased substantially in pricing and many varieties are sold with subsidized prices from local utilities

led tube lamps  
led tube lights are designed to physically fit in fixtures intended for   some led tube lamps are intended to be a drop-in replacement into existing fixtures if appropriate
is used  others require rewiring of the fixtures to remove the ballast  an led tube lamp generally uses many individual surface-mounted
which are directional and require proper orientation during installation as opposed to fluorescent tube lamps which emit light in all directions around the tube  most led tube lights available can be used in place of t8  t10  or t12   t8 is d26mm  t10 is d30mm  in lengths of 590mm  23in   1,200mm  47in  and 1,500mm  59in  
lighting designed for leds  
led-wall lamp
newer light fittings designed for led lamps  or indeed with long-lived leds built-in  have been coming into use as the need for compatibility with existing fittings diminishes  such lighting does not require each bulb to contain circuitry to operate from  
specialty uses  
led flashlight replacement bulb  left   with tungsten equivalent  right 
white led lamps have achieved market dominance in applications where high efficiency is important at low power levels  some of these applications include   solar-powered garden or walkway lights  and bicycle lights  monochromatic  colored  led lamps are now commercially used for traffic signal lamps  where the ability to emit bright monochromatic light is a desired feature  and in strings of holiday lights 
are widely used for their long life and small size  allowing for multiple bulbs   improving road safety  led lamps are also becoming popular in homes  especially for bathroom and medicine cabinet lighting 
comparison to other lighting technologies  
see
for an efficiency chart comparing various technologies 
 light bulbs  generate light by passing electric current through a resistive filament  thereby heating the filament to a very high temperature so that it glows and emits
over a broad range of wavelengths  incandescent sources yield a  warm  yellow or white color quality depending on the filament   incandescent lamps emit 98  of the energy input as heat  a 100 w light bulb for 120 v operation emits about 1,700 lumens  about 17 lumens w  for 230 v bulbs the figures are 1340 lm and 13.4 lm w  incandescent lamps are relatively inexpensive to make  the typical lifespan of an ac incandescent lamp is 750 to 1,000 hours  they work well with dimmers  most older light fixtures are designed for the size and shape of these traditional bulbs  in the u s  the regular sockets are e26 and e11  and e27 and e14 in some european countries 
work by passing electricity through mercury vapor  which in turn emits ultraviolet light  the ultraviolet light is then absorbed by a phosphor coating inside the lamp  causing it to glow  or fluoresce  conventional linear fluorescent lamps have life spans around 20,000 and 30,000 hours based on 3 hours per cycle according to lamps nlpip reviewed in 2006  induction fluorescent relies on electromagnetism rather than the cathodes used to start conventional linear fluorescent  the newer rare earth triphosphor blend linear fluorescent lamps made by osram  philips  crompton and others have a life expectancy greater than 40,000 hours  if coupled with a warm-start electronic ballast  the life expectancy depends on the number of on off cycles  and is lower if the light is cycled often  the ballast-lamp combined system efficacy for then current linear fluorescent systems in 1998 as tested by nlpip ranged from 80 to 90 lm w 
  specified lifespan typically ranges from 6,000 hours to 15,000 hours 
electricity prices vary in different areas of the world  and are customer dependent  in the us generally  commercial  0.103 usd kwh  and industrial  0.068 usd kwh  electricity prices are lower than residential  0.123 usd kwh  due to fewer transmission losses

in keeping with the long life claimed for led lamps  long warranties are offered  one manufacturer warrants lamps for professional use  depending upon type  for periods of  defined   normal use  ranging from 1 year or 2,000 hours  whichever comes first  to 5 years or 20,000 hours  a typical domestic led lamp is stated to have an  average life  of 15,000 hours  15 years at 3 hours day   and to support 50,000 switch cycles 
incandescent and halogen light bulbs naturally have a
of 1  but compact fluorescent and led lamps use input
and this causes lower power factors  low power factors can result in surcharges for commercial energy users  cfl and led lamps are available with driver circuits to provide any desired power factor  or site-wide
can be performed  eu standards requires a power factor better than 0.5 for bulb powers up to 25 watt and above 0.9 for higher power bulbs 
energy star qualification  
is an international standard for
products  devices carrying the energy star service mark generally use 2030  less energy than required by us standards 
 
reduces energy costs uses at least 75  less energy than
lighting  saving on operating expenses 
reduces maintenance costs lasts 35 to 50 times longer than incandescent lighting and about 2 to 5 times longer than fluorescent lighting  no bulb-replacements  no ladders  no ongoing disposal program 
reduces cooling costs leds produce very little heat 
is guaranteed comes with a minimum three-year warranty far beyond the industry standard 
offers convenient features available with dimming on some indoor models and automatic daylight shut-off and motion sensors on some outdoor models 
is durable wont break like a bulb 
to qualify for energy star certification  led lighting products must pass a variety of tests to prove that the products will display the following characteristics 
brightness is equal to or greater than existing lighting technologies  incandescent or fluorescent  and light is well distributed over the area lit by the fixture 
light output remains constant over time  only decreasing towards the end of the rated lifetime  at least 35,000 hours or 12 years based on use of 8 hours per day  
excellent color quality  the shade of white light appears clear and consistent over time 
efficiency is as good as or better than fluorescent lighting 
light comes on instantly when turned on 
no flicker when dimmed 
no off-state power draw  the fixture does not use power when it is turned off  with the exception of external controls  whose power should not exceed 0.5 watts in the off state 
of at least 0.7 for all lamps of 5w or greater 
limitations  
color rendering is not identical to incandescent lamps which emit close to perfect
as that from the sun and what eyes have evolved for  a measurement unit called
is used to express how the light source s ability to render the eight color sample chips compare to a reference on a scale from 0 to 100  leds with cri below 75 are not recommended for use in indoor lighting 
led lamps may flicker  the effect can be seen on a slow motion video of such a lamp  the extent of flicker is based on the quality of the dc power supply built into the lamp structure  usually located in the lamp base  longer exposures to flickering light contribute to headaches and eye strain 
led efficiency and life span drop at higher temperatures  which limits the power that can be used in lamps that physically replace existing filament and compact fluorescent types 
is a significant factor in design of solid state lighting equipment 
led lamps are sensitive to excessive heat  like most
electronic components  led lamps should be checked for compatibility for use in totally or partially enclosed fixtures before installation since heat build-up could cause lamp failure and or fire 
the long life of leds  expected to be about 50 times that of the most common incandescent bulbs and significantly longer than fluorescent types  is advantageous for users but will affect manufacturers as it reduces the market for replacements in the distant future

 exposure to intense blueish white light during the day  and
 wearing blue tinted goggles at night to cut out all blueish light   some organizations recommend that people should not use bluish white lamps at night  the american medical association argues against using bluish white leds for municipal street lighting 
efficiency droop  
the term  efficiency droop  refers to the decrease in
of leds as the
increases above tens of   instead of increasing current levels  luminance is usually increased by combining multiple leds in one bulb  solving the problem of efficiency droop would mean that household led light bulbs would need fewer leds  which would significantly reduce costs 
in addition to being less efficient  operating leds at higher electric currents creates higher heat levels which compromise the lifetime of the led  because of this increased heating at higher currents 
have an industry standard of operating at only 350ma  350ma is a good compromise between light output  efficiency  and longevity 
often involves using
to keep the
at lower levels 
early suspicions were that the led droop was caused by elevated temperatures  scientists proved the opposite to be true that  although the life of the led would be shortened  elevated temperatures actually improved the efficiency of the led  the mechanism causing efficiency droop was identified in 2007 as   which was taken with mixed reaction  in 2013  a study conclusively identified auger recombination as the cause of efficiency droop
