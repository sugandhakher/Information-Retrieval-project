in china  plug-in electric vehicles  together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles  nevs   however  in the united states 
 nevs  are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour  72km h   are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour  48km h   and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000lbs

the concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged
on board vehicles for propulsion  battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology    that have higher power and

a battery-electric minibus in   england
operates nine
electric buses  which have been in operation since 1992 and have carried 11.3 million passengers and covered a distance of 3,100,000 kilometres  1,900,000mi   they were made locally by   two of these buses were used for the
in atlanta 
beginning in the summer of 2000 
began operating a 16-passenger
electric shuttle bus  and in the fall of 2000  new york city began testing a 66-passenger battery-powered   an all-electric version of the   a similar bus was operated in
for 14 months ending in april  2004 
the
used a fleet of 50 electric buses  which have a range of 130km  81mi  with the air conditioning on  they use
batteries  and consume about 1kwh mi  0.62kwh km  2.2mj km   the buses were designed by the beijing institute of technology and built by the jinghua coach co  ltd  the batteries are replaced with fully charged ones at the recharging station to allow 24-hour operation of the buses 
in   the bus electric phenomenon is in development  but we already can find some of them in operation in numerous cities of france  pvi  a medium company located in the paris region  is one of the leader of the market with its brand

in 2014  the first production model all-electric school bus was delivered to the kings canyon unified school district in californias   the bus was one of four the district ordered  this battery electric school bus  which has 4 sodium nickel batteries  is the first modern electric school bus approved for student transportation by any state

of production batteries available in 2015 compared with
means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges  recharging can also take significant lengths of time  for journeys within a single battery charge  rather than long journeys  electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight

electric cars have the potential of significantly reducing
by having   vehicle
savings depend on how the electricity is generated  with the current   using an electric car would result in a 30 percent reduction in
emissions  given the current energy mixes in other countries  it has been predicted that such emissions would decrease by 40 percent in the uk  19 percent in china  and as little as 1 percent in germany   
electric cars are expected to have a major impact in the auto industry given advantages in   less dependence on oil  and expected rise in gasoline prices  world governments are pledging billions to fund development of electric vehicles and their components  the us has pledged us 2.4 billion in federal grants for electric cars and batteries  china has announced it will provide us 15 billion to initiate an electric car industry

electric cars have traditionally used series wound dc motors  a form of   separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of dc motors available  more recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of
types  as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out  these are usually
