a wood gas generator is a
unit which converts timber or
into   a
consisting of
      traces of   and other gases  which - after cooling and filtering - can then be used to power an
or for other purposes  historically wood gas generators were often mounted on   but present studies and developments concentrate mostly on stationary plants

history  
origins  
gasification had been an important and common technology which was widely used to generate
from coal mainly for lighting purposes during the 19th and early 20th century  when the first stationary
based on the
became available in the 1870s  they began displacing steam engines as prime movers in many works requiring stationary motive power  adoption accelerated after the otto engine s
expired in 1886  the potential and practical applicability of gasification to
were well-understood from the earliest days of their development 
in 1873 
developed and patented the water gas process by which large amounts of
gas could be generated for residential and commercial use in heating and lighting  unlike the common coal gas  or coke gas which was used in municipal service  this gas provided a more efficient heating fuel 
during the late 19th century internal combustion engines were sometimes fueled by coal gas  and during the early 20th century many stationary engines switched to using
created from
which was substantially cheaper than coal gas which was based on the distillation  pyrolysis  of more expensive coal 
in about 1920 french inventor
created the  imbert  downdraft generator 
imbert gasifier on a
truck converted to a tractor
during
was rationed and in short supply  in great britain  france  the united states and germany  large numbers of such generators were constructed or improvised to convert wood and coal into fuel for vehicles  commercial generators were in production before and after the war for use in special circumstances or in  
germany produced gazogene units for vehicles including cars  trucks  artillery tractors and even tanks  to preserve the limited supplies of fuel  even in non-combatant countries  such as
or   gasogene was popular as oil became hard to obtain  in brazil  a racer named
won at  s
circuit in 1944  driving a wood gas-powered alfa romeo 
post wwii  
running on
in finland  the gas generator is on the trailer 
the us
 fema  published a book in march 1989 describing how to build a gas generator in an emergency when oil was not available 
a project about the energy future of europe was begun in 2005 in   austria with contribution of
research furtherance  the project consisted of a power plant with a wood gas generator and a gas engine to convert the wood gas into 2 electric power and 4.5mw heat  at the wood gas power plant are also two containers for experiments with wood gas  in one container is an experiment to convert wood gas  using the   to a -like fuel  by october 2005  it was possible to convert 5kg wood into 1 litre fuel 
design  
there is a rich literature on gas-works  town-gas  gas-generation  wood-gas  and producer gas  that is now in the public domain due to its age 
most successful wood gas generators in use in europe and the united states are some variation of the earlier imbert design  wood gas generators often use wood  however 
can also be used as a fuel  it is denser and produces a cleaner gas without the tarry volatiles and excessive water content of wood 
the fema unit from 1989 has distinct benefits over the earlier european units such as easier refueling and construction but is less popular than the earlier imbert design because of significant new problems  which include a lack of a fixed oxidization zone and allows the oxidization zone to creep to a larger area  causing a drop in temperature  a lower
leads to
production and it lacks a true reduction zone further increasing this design s propensity to produce tar  tar in the wood gas stream is considered a dirty gas and tar will gum up a motor quickly  possibly leading to stuck valves  and rings 
a new design known as the keith gasifier improves on the fema unit  incorporating extensive heat recovery and eliminating the tar problem  testing at auburn university has shown it to be 37  more efficient than running gasoline  this system set the world speed record for biomass powered vehicles and has made several cross country tours 
the united nations produced the foa 72 document with details about their wood gas generator design and construction  as does world bank technical paper 296 
advantages  
wood gas generators have a number of advantages over use of
fuels 
they can be used to run
 or   for maximal efficiency  using wood  a   and in the absence of petroleum or   for example  during a fuel shortage 
they have a closed   contribute less to   and are sustainable in nature 
they can be relatively easily fabricated in a crisis using materials on hand 
they are far cleaner burning than a wood fire or a
 without    producing little  if any soot 
when used in a stationary design  they reach their true potential  as they are feasible to use in small
scenarios  with heat recovery from the wood gas producer  and possibly the engine generator  for example  to heat water for    even in industrialized countries  even during good economic times  provided that a sufficient supply of wood is attainable  larger-scale installations can reap even better efficiencies  and are useful for
as well 
disadvantages  
the disadvantages of wood gas generators are 
the large specific size
the relatively slow starting speed  the time to heat the initially cold batch of wood to the necessary temperature level can take many minutes and in bigger plants even hours until the designed power is reached 
a batch burning operation  that some designs feature  and that regularly interrupts the gas producing process 
the stop operation out of a high load level is difficult  for example the stop of the engine using the gas   the residual heat still produces gas  which for a certain time leaves the gasifier either without control  or has to be used in a burner
the primary combustible fuel-gas produced during gasification is   it is an intentional fuel-product  and is subsequently burned to safe
in the engine  or other application  along with the other fuel-gases  however  continuous exposure to carbon monoxide can be fatal to humans even in small to moderate concentrations 
the
of the wood  usually 15 to 20   and the
created by the o- and h-atoms of the dry wood itself  about 0.4 liters of water loaded with organic substances per kg of dry wood  condenses during the gas cooling and filtering procedure and yields a liquid  see also    which needs specific
treatment  this treatment requires about 25 to 35  of the created wood gas energy 
safety consideration  
when not carefully designed and used  there exists considerable potential for injury or death due to wood gas containing a large percentage of poisonous
 co  gas  wood gasifiers of proven design and thoroughly tested construction are considered safe to use outdoors  or in a partially enclosed space  for example  under a shelter open to the air on two sides  they may also be considered relatively safe to use in an extremely well ventilated  e g    indoor area not connected to any indoor area used for sleeping  equipped with redundant  more than 1   completely independent  battery-powered  regularly tested carbon-monoxide   however  prudence must dictate that any sort of experimental wood gasifier design or new construction be thoroughly tested outdoors  and only outdoors  with a  buddy  at all times  and with constant vigilance for any sign of headache  drowsiness  or nausea  as these are the first symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning 
in addition  mixtures of excessive quantities of air and gas should be avoided as this could lead to the deflagration  explosion  of the gas in question if a combustion source is present  long-term storage of wood-gas  except through the use of a -type water-displacement apparatus  should not be attempted  due to the volatile elements present in the gas  which  if allowed to excessively precipitate  will condense in the storage vessel  under no circumstances should wood-gas ever be compressed to more than 1 bar  15psi  above ambient  as this may induce condensation of volatiles  as well as lead to the likelihood of severe injury or death due to carbon monoxide or deflagration if the vessel leaks or fails   
media coverage  
in 2008  an example of designing and constructing a working wood gas generator powered truck was shown on the national geographic channel s
in the eighth episode   tree powered car  
in 2009  another example of designing and constructing a working wood gas powered generator engine was in the tv series
in the second episode of the first season  power struggle   also used in the tenth episode  exodus  to power an escape vehicle 
this truck set the
for biomass powered vehicles in september 2011
a 2010 mother earth news article discussed and showed pictures of a wood gas powered engine installed in a pickup truck  as part of the bbc science series  bang goes the theory   a volkswagen scirocco was converted to a design by martin bacon to run on   and after its build in 2010 was driven solely on coffee from london to manchester successfully  part of the team are now working on a more advanced design leaning towards top speed as opposed to range 
on september 14  2011  at the bonneville salt flats a truck modified with a wood gas powered engine set a new world speed record for vehicles powered by wood gas with a speed of 73mph 
on the popular us radio program   a caller in episode 1201  which aired on january 7  2012  and was subsequently named  20 miles per woodchip    described a wood gas generating vehicle he rode in as a boy during
in germany  the hosts were not familiar with the technology  likely because it was never widely adopted in the us 
on march 12  2012  on a season 2 episode of doomsday preppers  a wood gas generator is shown running a ford truck and a house electric generator by prepper scott hunt on his multi-acre woodland property in south carolina 
serbian tv sitcom  truckdrivers 2     kamiondzije ii   from 1983  talks  as a part of plot  about a gas generator affixed to a chassis of a lorry 
an article appeared in mother earth news in april 2012 featuring the keith gasifier  showing pictures and talking with inventor wayne keith 
in the bbc documentary   episode 5  aired october 2012  they built a coal gas powered ambulance according to the specifications of a 1943 gas powered vehicle 
in season 3 of mountain men on the history channel  eustice conway is shown operating a wood gasified toyota pickup for hauling goods
the finnish prime minister
has received some media attention also for the wood gas powered car he built as a hobby prior to his political career 
list of commercially available systems  
there are only a few companies that produce wood gasifier systems commercially  a list can be found here below  since wood gas systems have the tendency of being rather large  most focus on stationary applications  electricity production   some may be suitable for building into vehicles though
