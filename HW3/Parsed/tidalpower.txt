tidal power  also called tidal energy  is a form of
that converts the energy obtained from
into useful forms of power  mainly electricity 
although not yet widely used  tidal power has potential for future   tides are more predictable than
and   among sources of   tidal power has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities  thus constricting its total availability  however  many recent when    technological developments and improvements  both in design  e g      and turbine technology  e g  new      indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed  and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels 
historically 
have been used both in europe and on the atlantic coast of north america  the incoming water was contained in large storage ponds  and as the tide went out  it turned waterwheels that used the mechanical power it produced to mill grain  the earliest occurrences date from the   or even from   it was only in the 19th century that the process of using falling water and spinning
to create electricity was introduced in the u s  and europe 
the world s first large-scale tidal power plant is the
in france  which became operational in 1966  it was the largest tidal power station in terms of power output  before
surpassed it  total harvestable energy from tidal areas close to the coast is estimated to be around 1 terawatt worldwide

generation of tidal energy  
variation of tides over a day
main articles 
and
tidal power is taken from the earth s oceanic  
are periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies  these forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world s oceans  due to the strong attraction to the oceans  a bulge in the water level is created  causing a temporary increase in sea level  when the sea level is raised  water from the middle of the ocean is forced to move toward the shorelines  creating a tide  this occurrence takes place in an unfailing manner  due to the consistent pattern of the moons orbit around the earth  the magnitude and character of this motion reflects the changing positions of the moon and sun relative to the earth  the   and local  
tidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the  system  and to a lesser extent in the earth system  other natural energies exploited by human technology originate directly or indirectly with the sun  including        
and  
makes use of earth s mineral deposits of
elements  while
taps the earth s   which comes from a combination of residual heat from
 about 20   and heat produced through
 80   
a tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into electricity  greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation 
because the earth s tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the moon and sun and the earth s rotation  tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a
resource  movement of tides causes a
in the earthmoon system  this is a result of pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent
dissipation at the
and in   this loss of energy has caused the rotation of the earth to slow in the 4.5billion years since its formation  during the last 620million years the period of rotation of the earth  length of a day  has increased from 21.9hours to 24hours  in this period the earth has lost 17  of its rotational energy  while tidal power will take additional energy from the system  the effect   is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years 
generating methods  
the world s first commercial-scale and grid-connected tidal stream generator 
 in   the strong
shows the power in the  
tidal power can be classified into four generating methods 
tidal stream generator  
main article 
tidal stream generators  or tsgs  make use of the
of moving water to power turbines  in a similar way to
that use wind to power turbines  some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed  thus avoiding concerns over impact on the natural landscape  land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites  which can be captured with the use of turbines  these turbines can be horizontal  vertical  open  or ducted and are typically placed near the bottom of the water column where tidal velocities are greatest 
tidal barrage  
main article 
tidal barrages make use of the
in the difference in height  or   between high and low tides  when using tidal barrages to generate power  the potential energy from a tide is seized through strategic placement of specialized dams  when the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in  the temporary increase in tidal power is channeled into a large basin behind the dam  holding a large amount of potential energy  with the receding tide  this energy is then converted into
as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators  barrages are essentially
across the full width of a tidal estuary 
dynamic tidal power  
main article 
top-down view of a dtp dam  blue and dark red colors indicate low and high tides  respectively 
dynamic tidal power  or dtp  is an untried but promising technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows  it proposes that very long dams  for example  3050km length  be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean  without enclosing an area  tidal
are introduced across the dam  leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas  featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the uk  china  and korea 
tidal lagoon  
a newer tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides  the created reservoirs are similar to those of tidal barrages  except that the location is artificial and does not contain a preexisting ecosystem  the lagoons can also be in double  or triple  format without pumping or with pumping that will flatten out the power output  the pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays  excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time  geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near base load production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage  the proposed
in wales  united kingdom would be the first tidal power station of this type once built 
us and canadian studies in the twentieth century  
the first study of large scale tidal power plants was by the us
in 1924 which if built would have been located in the northern border area of the us state of
and the south eastern border area of the canadian province of new brunswick  with various dams  powerhouses  and ship locks enclosing the
and
 note  see map in reference   nothing came of the study and it is unknown whether canada had been approached about the study by the us federal power commission 
in 1956  utility
of
commissioned a pair of studies into the feasibility of commercial tidal power development on the
side of the bay of fundy  the two studies  by
of
and by
of
independently concluded that millions of horsepower could be harnessed from fundy but that development costs would be commercially prohibitive at that time 
there was also a report on the international commission in april 1961 entitled  investigation of the international passamaquoddy tidal power project  produced by both the us and canadian federal governments  according to benefit to costs ratios  the project was beneficial to the us but not to canada  a highway system along the top of the dams was envisioned as well 
a study was commissioned by the canadian  nova scotian and new brunswick governments  reassessment of fundy tidal power  to determine the potential for tidal barrages at chignecto bay and minas basin  at the end of the fundy bay estuary  there were three sites determined to be financially feasible  shepody bay  1550 mw   cumberline basin  1085 mw   and cobequid bay  3800 mw   these were never built despite their apparent feasibility in 1977 
tidal power development in the uk  
the world s first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the uk  based in orkney  scotland  the
has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world  emec provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions  its grid connected tidal test site is located at the fall of warness  off the island of eday  in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the atlantic ocean and north sea  this area has a very strong tidal current  which can travel up to 4m s  8 knots  in spring tides  tidal energy developers that have tested at the site include  alstom  formerly tidal generation ltd   andritz hydro hammerfest  atlantis resources corporation  nautricity  openhydro  scotrenewables tidal power  voith  the resource could be 4 tj per year

a small project was built by the soviet union at
on the   it has 0.4mw installed capacity  in 2006 it was upgraded with a 1.2mw experimental advanced  
in south korea is a tidal stream generation scheme planned to be expanded progressively to 90 mw of capacity by 2013  the first 1 mw was installed in may 2009 
a 1.2 mw
system became operational in late 2008 on
in  
the contract for an 812 mw tidal barrage near
 south korea  north-west of incheon has been signed by daewoo  completion is planned for 2015 
a 1,320 mw

the scottish government has approved plans for a 10mw array of tidal stream generators near     costing 40 million pounds  and consisting of 10 turbines  enough to power over 5,000 homes  the first turbine is expected to be in operation by 2013 
the indian state of
is planning to host south asia s first commercial-scale tidal power station  the company atlantis resources planned to install a 50mw tidal farm in the gulf of kutch on india s west coast  with construction starting early in 2012 
ocean renewable power corporation was the first company to deliver tidal power to the us grid in september  2012 when its pilot tidgen system was successfully deployed in   near eastport 
in new york city  30 tidal turbines will be installed by verdant power in the east river by 2015 with a capacity of 1.05mw 
construction of a 320 mw tidal lagoon power plant outside the city of
in the uk was granted planning permission in june 2015 and work is expected to start in 2016  once completed  it will generate over 500gwh of electricity per year  enough to power roughly 155,000 homes 
a turbine project is being installed in
in 2014 
tidal power issues  
environmental concerns  
tidal power can have effects on marine life  the turbines can accidentally kill swimming sea life with the rotating blades  although projects such as the one in strangford feature a safety mechanism that turns off the turbine when marine animals approach  some
may no longer utilize the area if threatened with a constant rotating or noise-making object  marine life is a huge factor when placing tidal power
in the water and precautions are made to ensure that as many
as possible will not be affected by it  the
provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy 
tidal turbines  
the main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices  as with all offshore renewable energies  there is also a concern about how the creation of
and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms  it should be noted that because these devices are in the water  the acoustic output can be greater than those created with   depending on the
and
of
generated by the tidal energy devices  this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals  particularly those who
to communicate and navigate in the marine environment  such as
and    tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading farfield
and disrupting
processes  depending on the size of the project  these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore
and processes 
tidal barrage  
installing a barrage may change the shoreline within the
or   affecting a large ecosystem that depends on   inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay  there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary  causing additional
 suspended solids  and less saltwater  which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals  migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams  and may attempt to pass through the turbines  the same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages  decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue  though locks can be added to allow slow passage  however  the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge  calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary  in august 2004  a
swam through the open
of the
at slack tide  ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the  
tidal lagoon  
environmentally  the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the   acoustic output from turbines  and changes in sedimentation processes  however  all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay 
corrosion  
salt water causes corrosion in metal parts  it can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water  the use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels  high-nickel alloys  copper-nickel alloys  nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce  or eliminate  corrosion damage 
mechanical fluids  such as lubricants  can leak out  which may be harmful to the marine life nearby  proper maintenance can minimize the amount of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment 
fouling  
the biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms  in the
at
in british columbia this is documented  also see
and several structural materials and coatings were tested by the
to assist clean current in reducing fouling on the turbine and other underwater infrastructure 
structural health monitoring  
the high load factors resulting from the fact that water is 800 times denser than air and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind makes tidal energy particularly attractive for electric power generation  condition monitoring is the key for exploiting it cost-efficiently
