carbon dioxide   co2  is a colorless and odorless
vital to
on earth  this naturally occurring
is composed of a
atom
to two
  carbon dioxide exists in
as a
at a concentration of about 0.04 percent  400   by volume  natural sources include  
and   and it is freed from
by

is the primary source of carbon in life on earth and its concentration in earth s pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the
was regulated by
organisms and geological phenomena  as part of the       and
use

from carbon dioxide and water  with oxygen produced as a waste product 
carbon dioxide  co2  is produced by all
when they metabolize carbohydrate and lipids to produce energy by   it is returned to water via the
and to the air via the lungs of air-breathing land animals  including humans  carbon dioxide is produced during the processes of
of organic materials and the
of sugars in  
and   it is produced by combustion of  
and
such as coal   
and  
it is a versatile industrial material  used  for example  as an inert gas in welding and fire extinguishers  as a pressurizing gas in air guns and oil recovery  as a chemical feedstock and in liquid form as a solvent in decaffeination of coffee and   it is added to drinking water and
including
and

carbon dioxide is a significant   since the   anthropogenic emissions - including the burning of carbon-based
and land use changes  primarily   - have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere  leading to   it is also a major cause of

background  
crystal structure of
carbon dioxide was the first gas to be described as a discrete substance  in about 1640  the
chemist
observed that when he burned
in a closed vessel  the mass of the resulting
was much less than that of the original charcoal  his interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a  gas  or  wild spirit   spiritus sylvestre  
the properties of carbon dioxide were studied more thoroughly in the 1750s by the
physician   he found that
   could be heated or treated with
to yield a gas he called  fixed air   he observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life  black also found that when bubbled through
 a saturated aqueous solution of    it would
calcium carbonate  he used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation  in 1772  english chemist
published a paper entitled impregnating water with fixed air in which he described a process of dripping
 or oil of vitriol as priestley knew it  on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide  and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas 
carbon dioxide was first liquefied  at elevated pressures  in 1823 by
and   the earliest description of solid carbon dioxide was given by   who in 1835 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide  only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a  snow  of solid co2

carbon dioxide is used to produce
and   traditionally  the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation  but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process  in the case of bottled and kegged beer  the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide  with the exception of british   draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide  sometimes mixed with nitrogen 
wine making  
carbon dioxide in the form of
is often used in the
process to cool down clusters of
quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous
by wild   the main advantage of using dry ice over regular water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that may decrease the
concentration in the   and therefore also decrease the
concentration in the finished wine 
dry ice is also used during the
phase of the wine making process to keep grapes cool  the carbon dioxide gas that results from the sublimation of the dry ice tends to settle to the bottom of tanks because it is denser than air  the settled carbon dioxide gas creates a hypoxic environment which helps to prevent bacteria from growing on the grapes until it is time to start the fermentation with the desired strain of yeast 
carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for   the process used to produce
wine 
carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other
vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation  though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine  making a previously still wine slightly fizzy  for this reason  other gases such as
or
are preferred for this process by professional wine makers 
inert gas  
it is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic  pressurized gas  systems in portable pressure tools  carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for   although in the welding arc  it reacts to
most metals  use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more
than those made in more inert atmospheres  and that such weld joints deteriorate over time because of the formation of carbonic acid    it is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as
or     when used for   co2 use is sometimes referred to as mag welding  for metal active gas  as co2 can react at these high temperatures  it tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres  improving the flow characteristics  although  this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site  this is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding  as it tends to embrittle the site  but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding  where ultimate ductility is not a major concern 
it is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable  and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60
 870 psi  59 atm   allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would  life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation  aluminium capsules of co2 are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for  
markers  inflating bicycle tires  and for making   rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines  high concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests  liquid carbon dioxide is used in
of some food products and technological materials  in the preparation of specimens for
and in the
of
beans 
fire extinguisher  
carbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas  it does not itself react to extinguish the flame  but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it  some   especially those designed for electrical fires  contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure  carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires  but not on ordinary combustible fires  because although it excludes oxygen  it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen  their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that  unlike water or other chemical based methods  carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits  leading to even more damage to equipment  because it is a gas  it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in it infrastructure rooms  where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases  carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space  international maritime organization standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms  carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths  because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations  a review of co2 systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report  causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries

oil recovery  
carbon dioxide is used in
where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells  usually under
conditions  when it becomes miscible with the oil  this approach can increase original oil recovery by reducing residual oil saturation by between 7 per cent to 23 per cent additional to   it acts as both a pressurizing agent and  when dissolved into the underground   significantly reduces its viscosity  and changing surface chemistry enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the reservoir to the removal well  in mature oil fields  extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points

organisms  these effects span the
from
to
and include organisms such as        
and   under normal conditions  calcium carbonate is stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at
concentrations  however  as ocean ph falls  so does the concentration of this ion  and when carbonate becomes undersaturated  structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution  corals  coccolithophore algae  coralline algae  foraminifera 
and
experience reduced calcification or enhanced dissolution when exposed to elevated co
2 
gas solubility decreases as the temperature of water increases  except when both pressure exceeds 300 bar and temperature exceeds 393 k  only found near deep geothermal vents  and therefore the rate of uptake from the atmosphere decreases as ocean temperatures rise 
most of the co2 taken up by the ocean  which is about 30  of the total released into the atmosphere  forms carbonic acid in equilibrium with bicarbonate  some of these chemical species are consumed by photosynthetic organisms that remove carbon from the cycle  increased co2 in the atmosphere has led to decreasing
of seawater  and there is concern that this may adversely affect organisms living in the water  in particular  with decreasing alkalinity  the availability of carbonates for forming shells decreases  although there s evidence of increased shell production by certain species under increased co2 content 
noaa states in their may 2008  state of the science fact sheet for   that 
 the oceans have absorbed about 50  of the carbon dioxide  co2  released from the burning of fossil fuels  resulting in chemical reactions that lower ocean ph  this has caused an increase in hydrogen ion  acidity  of about 30  since the start of the industrial age through a process known as  ocean acidification   a growing number of studies have demonstrated adverse impacts on marine organisms  including 
the rate at which reef-building corals produce their skeletons decreases  while production of numerous varieties of jellyfish increases 
the ability of marine algae and free-swimming zooplankton to maintain protective shells is reduced 
the survival of larval marine species  including commercial fish and shellfish  is reduced  
also  the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  writes in their climate change 2007  synthesis report 
 the uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in ph of 0.1 units  increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations lead to further acidification    while the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented  the progressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organisms  e g  corals  and their dependent species  
some marine calcifying organisms  including coral reefs  have been singled out by major research agencies  including noaa  ospar commission  nanoos and the ipcc  because their most current research shows that ocean acidification should be expected to impact them negatively 
carbon dioxide is also introduced into the oceans through hydrothermal vents  the champagne hydrothermal vent  found at the northwest eifuku volcano at   produces almost pure liquid carbon dioxide  one of only two known sites in the world 
biological role  
carbon dioxide is an end product of
in organisms that obtain energy by breaking down sugars  fats and
with
as part of their   this includes all plants  algae and animals and
fungi and bacteria  in   the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body s tissues to the skin  e g     or the gills  e g      from where it dissolves in the water  or to the lungs from where it is exhaled  during active photosynthesis

  commonly abbreviated to rubisco  is the
involved in the first major step of carbon fixation  the production of two molecules of

rubisco is thought to be the single most abundant protein on earth 
use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the
of more complex organic molecules  such as  
and   these are used for their own growth  and also as the basis of the
and webs that feed other organisms  including animals such as ourselves  some important phototrophs  the
synthesise hard
scales  a globally significant species of coccolithophore is
whose
scales have formed the basis of many
such as   where what was previously atmospheric carbon can remain fixed for geological timescales 
plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm co2 when compared with ambient conditions  though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients  elevated co2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops  with wheat  rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 1214  under elevated co2 in face experiments 
increased atmospheric co2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased   studies using
have shown that co2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants  this may have knock-on effects on other parts of
as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein 
the concentration of secondary
such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids can also be altered in plants exposed to high concentrations of co2 
plants also emit co2 during respiration  and so the majority of plants and algae  which use   are only net absorbers during the day  though a growing forest will absorb many tons of co2 each year  a mature forest will produce as much co2 from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens  e g   fallen branches  as is used in photosynthesis in growing plants  contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral  mature forests can continue to accumulate carbon and remain valuable   helping to maintain the carbon balance of earth s atmosphere  additionally  and crucially to life on earth  photosynthesis by phytoplankton consumes dissolved co2 in the upper ocean and thereby promotes the absorption of co2 from the atmosphere 
toxicity

main symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity  by increasing
in air 
carbon dioxide content in fresh air  averaged between sea-level and 10 kpa level  i e   about 30km  19mi  altitude  varies between 0.036   360 ppm  and 0.041   410 ppm   depending on the location   
co2 is an
and not classified as toxic or harmful in accordance with
of
by using the   in concentrations up to 1   10,000 ppm   it will make some people feel drowsy and give the lungs a stuffy feeling  concentrations of 7  to 10   70,000 to 100,000 ppm  may cause suffocation  even in the presence of sufficient oxygen  manifesting as dizziness  headache  visual and hearing dysfunction  and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour  the physiological effects of acute carbon dioxide exposure are grouped together under the term   a subset of  
because it is heavier than air  in locations where the gas seeps from the ground  due to sub-surface volcanic or geothermal activity  in relatively high concentrations  without the dispersing effects of wind  it can collect in sheltered pocketed locations below average ground level  causing animals located therein to be suffocated  carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed  children have been killed in the same way near the city of
by co2 emissions from the nearby volcano   the
term for this phenomenon is    
adaptation to increased concentrations of co2 occurs in humans  including
and kidney bicarbonate production  in order to balance the effects of blood acidification     several studies suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces  e g  a   since the adaptation is physiological and reversible  as decrement in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level of exposure for five days  yet  other studies show a decrease in cognitive function even at much lower levels  also  with ongoing respiratory acidosis  adaptation or  
below 1   
there are few studies of the health effects of long-term continuous co2 exposure on humans and animals at levels below 1  and there is potentially a significant risk to humans in the near future with rising atmospheric co2 levels associated with   occupational co2 exposure limits have been set in the united states at 0.5   5000 ppm  for an eight-hour period  at this co2 concentration 
crew experienced headaches  lethargy  mental slowness  emotional irritation  and sleep disruption  studies in animals at 0.5  co2 have demonstrated kidney calcification and bone loss after eight weeks of exposure  a study of humans exposed in 2.5 hour sessions demonstrated significant effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as 0.1   1000ppm  co2 likely due to co2 induced increases in cerebral blood flow  another study observed a decline in basic activity level and information usage at 1000 ppm  when compared to 500 ppm 
ventilation  
poor ventilation is one of the main causes of excessive co2 concentrations in closed spaces  carbon dioxide differential above outdoor concentrations at steady state conditions  when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that co2 concentration has stabilized  are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person    higher co2 concentrations are associated with occupant health  comfort and performance degradation   
standard 62.12007 ventilation rates may result in indoor levels up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions  thus if the outdoor concentration is 400 ppm  indoor concentrations may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard  concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this  range of 3,000 or 4,000  
miners  who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation  referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as      choke damp  or  stythe   before more effective technologies were developed 
would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged
with them as they worked  the canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans  and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch  the
could also detect high levels of blackdamp  which sinks  and collects near the floor  by burning less brightly  while   another suffocating gas and explosion risk  would make the lamp burn more brightly 
human physiology  
content  
the body produces approximately 2.3 pounds  1.0kg  of carbon dioxide per day per person  containing 0.63 pounds  290g  of carbon 
in humans  this carbon dioxide is carried through the
and is breathed out through the lungs  resulting in lower concentrations in the   the carbon dioxide content of the blood is often given as the   which is the pressure which carbon dioxide would have had if it alone occupied the volume

transport in the blood  
co2 is carried in blood in three different ways   the exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood  
most of it  about 70  to 80   is converted to
ions hco

in the red blood cells  by the reaction co2   h2o  h2co3  h    hco

  the main oxygen-carrying molecule in   carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide  however  the co2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen  instead  it combines with the n-terminal groups on the four globin chains  however  because of
effects on the hemoglobin molecule  the binding of co2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen  the decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the   and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs  conversely  a rise in the partial pressure of co2 or a lower ph will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin  which is known as the

carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local
of blood supply  if its concentration is high  the
expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue 
bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood ph  a person s breathing rate influences the level of co2 in their blood  breathing that is too slow or shallow causes   while breathing that is too rapid leads to   which can cause  
although the body requires oxygen for metabolism  low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing  rather  breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels  as a result  breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all  such as pure nitrogen  can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing   this is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots  it is also why flight attendants instruct passengers  in case of loss of cabin pressure  to apply the
to themselves first before helping others  otherwise  one risks losing consciousness 
the respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial co2 pressure of 40mm hg  with intentional hyperventilation  the co2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 1020mm hg  the oxygen content of the blood is little affected   and the respiratory drive is diminished  this is why one can hold one s breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating  this carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming  which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving
