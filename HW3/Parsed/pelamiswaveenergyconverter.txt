the pelamis wave energy converter is a technology that uses the motion of
to create electricity  the machine is made up of connected sections which flex and bend as waves pass  it is this motion which is used to generate electricity 
developed by the now defunct
scottish company
 formerly ocean power delivery   the pelamis became the first offshore wave machine to generate electricity into the grid  when it was first connected to the uk grid in 2004  pelamis wave power then went on to build and test five additional pelamis machines  three first-generation p1 machines  which were tested in a farm off the coast of portugal in 2009  and two second-generation machines  the pelamis p2  which started tests off orkney in 2010

operation  
the pelamis machine is an offshore wave energy converter  operating in water depths greater than 50m  the machine consists of a series of semi-submerged cylindrical sections linked by hinged joints  as waves pass along the length of the machine  the sections move relative to one another  the wave-induced
of the sections is resisted by
which pump high pressure oil through
via smoothing   the hydraulic motors drive
to produce electricity  electricity from all the joints is fed down a single
to a junction on the   several devices can be connected and linked to shore through a single seabed cable 
principle  
the pelamis is an attenuating wave energy converter  the machine responds to the curvature of the waves  their shape  rather than the wave height  as waves can only reach a certain curvature before naturally breaking  this limits the range of motion through which the machine must move but maintains large motion at the joints in small waves 
projects  
p2 pelamis testing at emec  
the p2 pelamis design was pelamis wave power s second generation pelamis machine  the pelamis p2 is 180m long  4m diameter and approximately 1350 tonnes in weight  consisting of five tube sections and four flexible joints  the design is longer and fatter than the previous p1 design 
in 2010  pelamis wave power began tests of the first pelamis p2 machine at the   orkney  scotland  the machine is owned by the german utility company    and was the uk s first commercial supply contract in the
sector  in march 2010 pelamis wave power announced a second order for a p2 machine  from
renewables  part of   this second machine was installed for the first time at emec in may 2012  the two utility companies have announced that they will work together to share and collaborate in testing of the p2 pelamis technology 
projects formerly in development  
e on and scottishpower renewables have announced plans to build larger projects using pelamis machines in the waters off orkney s west coast  both companies won leases in 2010 from   who own the seabed around the uk  for projects of up to 50mw  the  pentland firth and orkney waters leasing round  was the world s first commercial scale wave and tidal energy leasing opportunity 
development history  
prototype pelamis machine  
the pelamis prototype machine at emec  orkney  scotland  2007
pelamis wave power tested their first full-scale prototype at the
in   scotland between 2004 and 2007  the machine  which was rated at 750kw  was the world s first offshore
machine to generate electricity into the grid system 
the prototype was 120m long and 3.5m in diameter  it consisted of four tube sections linked by three  shorter  power conversion modules
aguadoura wave farm  
main article 
in 2008 pelamis tested three first generation  p1 pelamis waves at the   located off the northwest coast of
near   the farm had an installed capacity of 2.25mw and was the world s first multiple machine wave power project  the project was part funded by portuguese utility   at the time owned by australian global investment company   the farm first generated electricity in july 2008 but was taken offline in november 2008 at the same time as babcock   brown encountered financial difficulties 
etymology  
is a yellow-bellied
that lives in tropical and subtropical waters  it prefers shallow inshore waters
