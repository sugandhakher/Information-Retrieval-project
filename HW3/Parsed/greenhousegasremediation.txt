greenhouse gas removal projects are a type of
that seek to remove
from the atmosphere  and thus they tackle the root cause of   these techniques either directly remove greenhouse gases  or alternatively seek to influence natural processes to remove greenhouse gases indirectly  the discipline overlaps with
and   and some projects listed may not be considered to be geoengineering by all commentators  instead being described as
