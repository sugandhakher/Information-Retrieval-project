history  
the first automotive combustion engines  so-called   were developed in the last quarter of the 19th century in germany  the fuel was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from   with a boiling point near 85c  octanes boil about 40c higher   it was well suited for early carburetors  evaporators   the development of a  spray nozzle  carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels  further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher   but early attempts were blocked by knocking  premature explosion of fuel   in the 1920s  antiknock compounds were introduced by
and boyd  specifically
 tel   this innovation started a cycle of improvements in fuel efficiency that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline  in the 1950s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels  and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets in carburetors  the 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline  these considerations led to the phasing out of tel and its replacement by other antiknock compounds  subsequently  low-sulfur gasoline was introduced  in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems 
etymology and terminology  
 mogas  redirects here  for other uses  see  
 gasoline  is cited  under the spelling  gasolene   from 1863 in the oxford english dictionary  it was never a trademark  although it may have been derived from older trademarks such as  cazeline  and  gazeline  
variant spellings of  gasoline  have been used to refer to raw
since the 16th century   petrol  was first used as the name of a refined petroleum product around 1870 by british wholesaler   who marketed it as a solvent  when the product later found a new use as a motor fuel    an associate of   suggested to carless that they register the trade mark  petrol   but by this time the word was already in general use  possibly inspired by the french ptrole  and the registration was not allowed  carless registered a number of alternative names for the product  while their competitors used the term  motor spirit  until the 1930s 
the use of the word gasoline instead of petrol outside north america can often be confusing  shortening gasoline to gas  which happens often  causes confusion with various forms of gas used as car fuel   
and    in many countries  gasoline has a colloquial name derived from that of the chemical

octane rating  
main article 
spark ignition engines are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called   however  the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone  rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time  this causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine  this is often referred to as
or end-gas knock  knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline s resistance to   which is expressed by its octane rating 
octane rating is measured relative to a mixture of
 an
of   and n-  there are different conventions for expressing octane ratings  so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used  one of the best known is the research octane number  ron  
the octane rating of typical commercially available gasoline varies by country  in     and   95 ron is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 ron is also available as a more expensive option  in the uk  ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is 95 ron  commonly available   premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 ron  and super unleaded is usually 97-98 ron    however  both shell and bp produce fuel at 102 ron for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain
began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 ron  in the us  octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 aki  91-92 ron  for regular  through 89-90 aki  94-95 ron  for mid-grade  equivalent to european regular   up to 90-94 aki  95-99 ron  for premium  european premium  
south africa s largest city    is located on the
at 1,753 metres  5,751ft  above sea level  so the
recommends 95 octane gasoline  petrol  at low altitude and 93 octane for use in johannesburg because  the higher the altitude the lower the air pressure  and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain  
the octane rating became important as the military sought higher output for
in the late 1930s and the 1940s  a higher octane rating allows a higher
or
boost  and thus higher temperatures and pressures  which translate to higher power output  some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power  in 1943  the
aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower  984kw  using 100 ron fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement  by the time of
during
both the raf and usaaf were conducting some operations in europe using 150 ron fuel  100/150    obtained by adding 2.5  aniline to 100 octane avgas  by this time the rolls-royce merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel 
stability  
quality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to the separation of the components  gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up  if left undiluted  improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a
system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate  if applicable to the vehicle   storage should be in an airtight container  to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas  that can withstand the
of the gasoline without venting  to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions  at a stable cool temperature  to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion  and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions   when gasoline is not stored correctly  gums and solids may be created  which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces  resulting in a condition called  stale fuel   gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture  then forming gums  solids  or two phases  a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase  
the presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank  fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance  on resumption of regular engine use  the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline  the addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle  some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing     1,2,4-trimethylbenzene  or other additives  fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines  such as lawnmower and tractor engines  especially when their use is seasonal  low to no use for one or more seasons of the year   users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure  to avoid storage at high temperatures  to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage  and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the  
gasoline stability requirements are set in standard astm d4814-14b  the standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engines 
energy content  
energy is obtained from the combustion of gasoline by the conversion of a hydrocarbon to
and   the combustion of octane follows this reaction

gasoline contains about 42.4  kg  120 mj us gal  33.3 kwh us gal  11.8 kwh kg  120,000 btu us gal  quoting the lower heating value 
gasoline blends differ  and therefore actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to 1.75  more or less than the average  on average  about 74 l of gasoline  19.5 us gal  16.3 imp gal  are available from a barrel of crude oil  about 46  by volume   varying due to quality of crude and grade of gasoline  the remainder are products ranging from tar to  
a high-octane-rated fuel  such as
 lpg  has an overall lower power output at the typical 10 1
of a gasoline engine  however  with an engine
to the
 i e  via higher compression ratios  such as 12 1 instead of 10 1   the power output can be improved  this is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking  resulting in a higher cylinder temperature  which improves efficiency  also  increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke  which is by far the greater effect  the higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process  an
engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages  chiefly detonation  of a high compression ratio  a high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of   along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow 
the lower energy content  per liter  of lpg in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower   energy content per kilogram is higher than for gasoline  higher
to
ratio  for an example see   
molecular weights of the above reagents are c8h18 114  o2 32  co2 44  h2o 18  therefore 1kg of fuel reacts with 3.51kg of oxygen to produce 3.09kg of carbon dioxide and 1.42kg of water 
density  
the density of gasoline ranges from 0.710.77kg l  719.7    0.026    6.073lb   7.29lb    higher densities having a greater volume of aromatics  since gasoline floats on water  water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless used in a fine mist  finished marketable gasoline is traded with a standard reference of 0.755kg l  and its price is escalated de-escalated according to its actual density 
chemical analysis and production  
some of the main components of gasoline      3-  and the octane enhancer  
a
in the united states
an oil rig in the
gasoline is produced in   roughly 19 us gallons  72 l  of gasoline is derived from a 42-gallon  159 l  barrel of crude oil  material separated from
via   called virgin or straight-run gasoline  does not meet specifications for modern engines  particularly the octane rating  see below   but can be pooled to the gasoline blend 
the bulk of a typical gasoline consists of
with between 4 and 12
atoms per molecule  commonly referred to as c4-c12   it is a mixture of paraffins    
 naphthenes   and olefins     where the usage of the terms paraffin and olefin is particular to the oil industry  the actual ratio depends on 
the oil refinery that makes the gasoline  as not all refineries have the same set of processing units 
the
feed used by the refinery 
the grade of gasoline  in particular  the octane rating 
the various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics  some important streams are 
straight-run gasoline  usually also called naphtha is distilled directly from crude oil  once the leading source of fuel  its low octane rating required lead additives  it is low in aromatics  depending on the grade of crude oil   containing some cycloalkanes  naphthenes  and no olefins  alkenes   between 0 and 20  of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline  because the supply of this fraction is insufficient   and its
is too low    the chemical properties  namely octane and   of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through
and   however  before feeding those units  the naphtha needs to be split in light and heavy naphtha  straight-run gasoline can be also used as a feedstock into steam-crackers to produce olefins 
reformate  produced in a
has a high octane rating with high
content  and relatively low olefins  alkenes   most of the     and
 the so-called   are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent 
catalytic cracked gasoline or catalytic cracked   produced from a   with a moderate octane rating  high olefins  alkene  content  and moderate aromatics level 
hydrocrackate  heavy  mid  and light  produced from a   with medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels 
alkylate is produced in an
unit  using as feedstocks isobutane and   alkylate contains no aromatics and alkenes and has high mon 
isomerate is obtained by isomerizing low octane straight run gasoline to iso-paraffins  non-chain alkanes  like isooctane   isomerate has medium ron and mon  but nil aromatics and olefins 
butane is usually blended in the gasoline pool  although the quantity of this stream is limited by the rvp specification 
the terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and terminology varies 
currently  many countries set limits on gasoline
in general  benzene in particular  and olefin  alkene  content  such regulations led to increasing preference for high octane pure paraffin  alkane  components  such as alkylate  and is forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content  in the eu the benzene limit is set at 1  volume for all grade of automotive gasoline 
gasoline can also contain other   such as
 deliberately added   plus small levels of contaminants  in particular
compounds  but these are usually removed at the refinery

 1814 t  of lead per year in the usa  from 1 january 1996  the
banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles in the usa  the use of tel also necessitated other additives  such as dibromoethane  first european countries started replacing lead by the end of the 1980s and by the end of the 1990s leaded gasoline was banned within the entire european union  reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the united states and south africa  a statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime  taking into account a 22-year time lag  the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve

 mmt   these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats so that they do not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel 
lrp was marketed during and after the phaseout of leaded motor fuels in the

environmental considerations  
combustion of 1 u s  gallon  3.8l  of gasoline produces 8.74 kilograms  19.3lb  of carbon dioxide  2.3kg l   a  
the main concern with gasoline on the environment  aside from the complications of its extraction and refining  is the potential   unburnt gasoline and   when in the   reacts in
to produce   vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline  but the increase is greatest at 10  by volume    at higher concentrations of ethanol above 10   the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease  at a 10  ethanol by volume  the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of photochemical smog  this rise in vapor pressure could be mitigated by increasing or decreasing the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mixture 
the chief risks of such leaks come not from vehicles  but from gasoline delivery truck accidents and leaks from storage tanks  because of this risk  most  underground  storage tanks now have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent any such leaks  such as monitoring systems  veeder-root  franklin fueling

from 1998 to 2004  the price of gasoline fluctuated between  1 and  2
per   after 2004  the price increased until the average gas price reached a high of  4.11 per u s  gallon in mid-2008  but receded to approximately  2.60 per u s  gallon by september 2009  more recently  the u s  experienced an upswing in gasoline prices through 2011  and by 1 march 2012  the national average was  3.74 per gallon 
in the united states  most consumer goods bear pre-tax prices  but gasoline prices are posted with taxes included  taxes are added by federal  state  and local governments  as of 2009  the federal tax is 18.4 per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 per gallon for diesel  excluding    among states  the highest gasoline tax rates  including the federal taxes as of 2005  are new york  62.9 gal   hawaii  60.1 gal   and california  60 gal  
about 9  of all gasoline sold in the us in may 2009 was premium grade  according to the energy information administration 
magazine says   if  your owners manual  says to use regular fuel  do sotheres no advantage to a higher grade   the associated press said premium gaswhich is a higher octane and costs more per gallon than regular unleadedshould be used only if the manufacturer says it is  required   cars with turbocharged engines and high compression ratios often specify premium gas because higher octane fuels reduce the incidence of  knock   or fuel pre-detonation  the price of gas varies during the summer and winter months
