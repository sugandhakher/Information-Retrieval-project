eco-sufficiency requires a reduction of the level of production consumption in those parts of the
with the highest
beyond reducing the use of
as well as waste and emissions per  consumption    delinking   given a very loose relation in rich countries between material wealth 
and human well-being  this might be possible even without reducing the latter  while  for example  increasing leisure and non-material activities for well-being 
there are potentials to reduce substantially the use of
without compromising human wealth  however  many studies show that
eats up these gains at least partially  if the economy grows by 2  per annum we need an increasing
by 4  in order to achieve a 2  reduction of the absolute resource use  while
aims to improve the effectiveness of material  energy  and land use  eco-sufficiency aims at reducing negative environmental consequences through a reduction of the demand for consumer goods 
eco-sufficiency is closely related to issues of
and   it can to some extent be achieved on the individual level  e g  through energy savings  reduction of transport and change in diets  less meat   however  it also requires a change in social frameworks  provided on the national or european level  including measures such as  
and new concepts of labour 
eco-sufficiency is largely associated with the idea of altruism  the sober lifestyle adopted by its advocates is a manifestation of their concern for the well-being of future generations  and thus to date is endorsed by only a small minority of members of industrialised societies  a wide spread of eco-sufficiency will only occur  if people find the new lifestyles sufficiently attractive  it needs to be shown that less material wealth can bring increased well-being or
to individuals and societies  for example  it has been shown that downsizing or relocating consumers can be motivated by purely selfish reasons such as improving ones health  avoiding stress  the nostalgia for a good old time and so on 
an important aspect here is related to the so-called work-and-spend cycle  if
and forms of work other than
 incl     such as caring 
and community work gain relevance  income - and therefore consumption - would be reduced
