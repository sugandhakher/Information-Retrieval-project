the mildura solar concentrator power station is a proposed 100  mw 
 cpv 
to be built at   near     it was proposed by   which was acquired by
in 2010  a 1.5mw demonstration plant was commissioned in april 2013  construction of the larger facility was expected to commence in 2014 and be completed in 2017 
the expansion plan was abandoned in august 2014 due to a number of factors  these included low wholesale
prices  a lack of commitment to clean energy by the
and uncertainty surrounding the

history  
the project to build a 154mw solar plant was announced in 2006 and expected to be completed in 2013  it was delayed after solar systems went into administration as a result of the   the demonstration plant was completed in 2013 
technology  
the  cs500  dish
unit design has 112 curved reflecting mirrors  which track the sun throughout the day  the combination of mirror profile  mounting framework  and solar receiver will deliver concentrated solar energy to each   the tracking mechanism allows electricity to be produced during the day whenever the sun is more than 5 above the horizon  direct current electricity from the receivers is passed through a
that produces grid-quality   transformers step up the voltage to the requirement of the local network at the point of connection  advantages claimed for this design include 
 the cs500 dish has a longer effective operating life than conventional   because the receiver is only a small area of pv  a 35 cs500 dish has a pv area of 0.23m whereas 35kw of traditional flat plate would use approximately 350m  maintenance is simple  quick and affordable  the modules include a specially designed filter that removes harmful uv radiation that reduces the operating efficiency and life of traditional pv technology  the modules are also cooled  which increases their effective operating life and their efficiency  
 the cs500 dish costs significantly less  per installed watt  than traditional pv technology  this is despite the fact that the cs500 is new and still near the top of its cost curve  advances in technology  maturity and volume production will further increase the gap  
 the cs500 produces more electricity  per installed watt  than fixed flatplate pv technology - by up to 30   this is because it tracks the sun and operates at lower temperatures  
previous projects  
the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia  with support from the
