carnot s theorem  developed in 1824 by   also called carnot s rule  is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any
can obtain  the efficiency of a carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs 
carnot s theorem states 
all heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a
operating between the same reservoirs 
every carnot heat engine between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient  regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details 
the formula for this maximum efficiency is

max

where tc is the
of the cold reservoir  th is the

  displaystyle  eta  
is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir 
based on modern thermodynamics  carnot s theorem is a result of the   historically  however  it was based on contemporary
and preceded the establishment of the second law

proof  
an impossible situation  a heat engine cannot drive a less efficient  reversible  heat engine without violating the second law of thermodynamics 
the proof of the carnot theorem is a   or   as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature  the heat engine with more efficiency  

m
  displaystyle  eta   m  
  is driving a heat engine with less efficiency  

l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
   causing the latter to act as a   this pair of engines receives no outside energy  and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir  however  if

it is generally agreed that this is impossible because it violates the  
we begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure  first  we must point out an important caveat  the engine with less efficiency  

l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
  is being driven as a heat pump  and therefore must be a
engine  if the less efficient engine  

l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
  is not reversible  then the device could be built  but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid 
by restricting our discussion to cases where engine  

l
  displaystyle  eta   l  
  has less efficiency than engine  

m
  displaystyle  eta   m  
   we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols

and
w
  displaystyle w 
represent
quantities  since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where

it may seem odd that a hypothetical heat pump with low efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics  but the

delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump 
having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct  carnot s theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines 
reversible engines  
to see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs
t
1
  displaystyle t  1  
and
t
2
  displaystyle t  2  
must have the same efficiency  assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of

  displaystyle  eta  
  and let the more efficient engine  m  drive the less efficient engine  l  as a heat pump  as the figure shows  this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy  which violates the second law of thermodynamics  therefore both  reversible  heat engines have the same efficiency  and we conclude that 
all reversible engines that operate between the same two heat reservoirs have the same efficiency 
this is an important result because it helps establish the   which implies that the change in
is unique for all reversible processes

if one of the engines is irreversible  it must be the  m  engine  placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible  l  engine  but if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine   i e   if

   then the second law of thermodynamics is violated  and  since the carnot cycle represents a reversible engine  we have the first part of carnot s theorem 
no irreversible engine is more efficient than the carnot engine operating between the same two reservoirs

where wcy is the work done per cycle  thus  the efficiency depends only on qc qh 
because all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient  any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t2 must have the same efficiency  meaning  the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only

  this is because carnot s theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work  whereas fuel cells and batteries instead convert chemical energy to work  nevertheless  the
