minerals  
main article 
minerals are needed to provide food  clothing  and housing  a
 usgs  study found a significant long-term trend over the 20th century for non-renewable resources such as minerals to supply a greater proportion of the raw material inputs to the non-fuel  non-food sector of the economy  an example is the greater consumption of crushed stone  sand  and gravel used in construction 
large-scale exploitation of minerals began in the
around 1760 in
and has grown rapidly ever since  technological improvements have allowed humans to dig deeper and access lower grades and different types of ore over that time  virtually all basic industrial metals  copper  iron  bauxite  etc    as well as   face production output limitations from time to time  because supply involves large up-front investments and is therefore slow to respond to rapid increases in demand 
minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the next 20 years 
gas  2023 
copper  2024   data from the united states geological survey  usgs  suggest that it is very unlikely that copper production will peak before 2040 
zinc  new developments in hydrometallurgy have transformed non-sulphide zinc deposits  largely ignored until now  into large low cost reserves 
minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the present century 
aluminium  2057 
coal  2060 
iron  2068  
such projections may change  as new discoveries are made and typically misinterpret available data on mineral resources and mineral reserves 
oil

and
is the period when the maximum rate of global
is reached  after which the rate of production enters terminal decline  it relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum  this  combined with increasing demand  will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products  most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation 
the
in the
indicates that the peaking of world oil production presents the u  s  and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem  as peaking is approached  liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically  and  without timely mitigation  the economic  social  and political costs will be unprecedented  viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides  but to have substantial impact  they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking 
deforestation  
main article 
is the clearing of forests by logging or burning of trees and plants in a forested area  as a result of deforestation  presently about one half of the forests that once covered
have been destroyed  it occurs for many different reasons  and it has several negative implications on the atmosphere and the quality of the land in and surrounding the forest 
causes  
one of the main causes of deforestation is clearing forests for agricultural reasons  as the population of developing areas  especially near rainforests  increases  the need for land for farming becomes more and more important  for most people  a forest has no value when its resources arent being used  so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests  for this reason  the economic value of the forests is very important for the developing countries 
environmental impact  
because deforestation is so extensive  it has made several significant impacts on the environment  including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  changing the water cycle  an increase in soil erosion  and a decrease in biodiversity    because trees and plants remove carbon dioxide and emit oxygen into the atmosphere  the reduction of forests contribute to about 12  of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions  one of the most pressing issues that deforestation creates is soil erosion  the removal of trees causes higher rates of erosion  increasing risks of landslides  which is a direct threat to many people living close to deforested areas  as forests get destroyed  so does the habitat for millions of animals  it is estimated that 80  of the worlds known biodiversity lives in the rainforests  and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating extinction at an alarming rate 
controlling deforestation  
the
and the
created programs such as
 redd   which works especially with developing countries to use subsidies or other incentives to encourage citizens to use the forest in a more sustainable way  in addition to making sure that emissions from deforestation are kept to a minimum  an effort to educate people on sustainability and helping them to focus on the long-term risks is key to the success of these programs  the
and its associated actions promotes reforestation  which is being encouraged in many countries in an attempt to repair the damage that deforestation has done 
wetlands

are areas that are often saturated by enough
or
to sustain vegetation that is usually adapted to saturated soil conditions  such as cattails  bulrushes  red maples  wild rice  blackberries  cranberries  and peat moss  because some varieties of wetlands are rich in minerals and nutrients and provide many of the advantages of both land and water environments they contain diverse species and possibly even form a food chain  when human activities take away resources many species are affected  an ecosystem contains many species 
years ago people assumed wetlands were useless so it was not a large concern when they were being dug up  many people want to use them for developing homes etc  on the other side of the argument  people believe that the wetlands are a vital source for other life forms and a part of the life cycle 
wetlands provide services for 
food and habitat
improving water quality
commercial fishing
floodwater reduction
shoreline stabilization
recreation
some loss of wetlands resulted from natural causes such as erosion  sedimentation  the buildup of soil by the settling of fine particles over a long period of time   subsidence  the sinking of land because of diminishing underground water supplies   and a rise in the sea level
