carbon dioxide removal  cdr  methods refers to a number of technologies which reduce the levels of
  among such technologies are      
and   cdr is a different approach than removing co2 from the stack emissions of large
point sources  such as   the latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but cannot reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere  as cdr removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  it creates   offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as domestic heating systems  airplanes and vehicle exhausts  it is regarded by some as a form of   while other commentators describe it as a form of
or extreme mitigation  whether cdr would satisfy common definitions of  climate engineering  or  geoengineering  usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken 
the likely need for cdr has been publicly expressed by a range of individuals and organizations involved with climate change issues  including
chief   the
executive secretary   and the   institutions with major programs focusing on cdr include the lenfest center for sustainable energy at the   and the climate decision making center  an international collaboration operated out of carnegie-mellon university s department of engineering and public policy 
the
effectiveness of air capture is limited by societal investment  land use  availability of geologic reservoirs  and leakage  the reservoirs are estimated to be sufficient to for storing at least 545 gtc  storing 771 gtc would cause an 186 ppm atmospheric reduction  in order to return the atmospheric co2 content to 350 ppm we need atmospheric reduction of 50 ppm plus an additional 2 ppm per year of current emissions

methods  
bio-energy with carbon capture   storage  
main article 
bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  or beccs  uses biomass to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  and carbon capture and storage technologies to concentrate and permanently store it in deep geological formations 
beccs is currently  as of october 2012  the only cdr technology deployed at full industrial scale  with 550 000 tonnes co2 year in total capacity operating  divided between three different facilities  as of january 2012  
the   the uk
  the   the   and the
issued a joint report on carbon dioxide removal technologies as part of the avoid  avoiding dangerous climate change research program  stating that  overall  of the technologies studied in this report 
has the greatest maturity and there are no major practical barriers to its introduction into todays energy system  the presence of a primary product will support early deployment  
according to the    achieving lower concentration targets  450 ppm  depends significantly on the use of   
biochar  
main article 
is created by the
of   and is under investigation as a method of  
is a charcoal that is used for agricultural purposes which also aids in   the capture or hold of carbon  it is created using a process called pyrolysis  which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels  what remains is a material known as char  similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process  thus the use of biomass  biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms  most commonly plants or plant based material  the offset of ghg emission  if biochar were to be implemented  would be a maximum of 12   this equates to about 106 metric tons of co2 equivalents  on a medium conservative level  it would be 23  less than that  at 82 metric tons  a study done by the uk biochar research center has stated that  on a conservative level  biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year  with greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar  the benefit would the storage of 5-9 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils 
enhanced weathering  
main article 
enhanced weathering refers to chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land or ocean based techniques  examples of land based enhanced weathering techniques are in-situ carbonation of silicates    for example  has the potential to store thousands of years worth of co2 emissions according to one estimate    ocean based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement  such as  grinding  dispersing and dissolving olivine  limestone  silicates  or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and co2 sequestration  enhanced weathering is considered as one of the least expensive of geoengineering options  one example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the
project in iceland   
direct air capture  
carbon dioxide can be removed from ambient air through chemical processes  sequestered  and stored  one proposed method is by so-called artificial trees  this concept  proposed by climate scientist
and science writer   imagines huge numbers of artificial trees around the world to remove ambient co2  the technology is now being pioneered by   a researcher at the     whose artificial tree technology can suck up to 1,000 times more co2 from the air than real trees can    at a rate of about one ton of carbon per day if the artificial tree is approximately the size of an actual tree  the co2 would be captured in a filter and then removed from the filter and stored 
the chemistry used is a variant of that described   as it is based on   however  in a more recent design proposed by   the process can be carried out at only 40c by using a -based   which takes advantage of changes in
to prompt the release of captured co2  instead of using a kiln  this reduces the energy required to operate the process 
another substance which can be used are
 or mof s   a special mof has been made specifically for locking co2 by joeri denayer 
in 2008  the
covered the work of   of   who built a tower  4 feet wide and 20 feet tall  1.26.1 meters   with a fan at the bottom that sucks air in  which comes out again at the top  in the process  about half the co2 is removed from the air 
this device uses the chemical process described in detail   the system demonstrated on the discovery channel was a 1/90,000th scale test system of the capture section  the reagents are regenerated in a separate facility  the main costs of a full plant will be the cost to build it  and the energy input to regenerate the chemicals and produce a pure stream of co2 
to put this into perspective  people in the u s  emit about 20 tonnes of co2 per person annually    in other words  each person in the u s  would require a tower like the one featured by the discovery channel to remove this amount of co2 from the air  requiring an annual 2 megawatt-hours of electricity to operate it  by comparison  a refrigerator consumes about 1.2 megawatt-hours annually  2001 figures   but  by combining many small systems such as this into one large system  the construction costs and energy use can be reduced 
it has been proposed that the
to generate electricity from thermal air currents also be used at the same time for amine gravity scrubbing of co2  some heat would be required to regenerate the amine 
finally  a similar co2 scrubber has also been build by   besides simply focusing on capturing the co2  the company also puts emphasis on reuse of the co2  for example in the production of fuels  which would thus be  
direct air capture has been proposed as a way of generating carbon-neutral organic chemicals  by harvesting the atmospheric compounds and then using them in the production and synthesis of polymers and fuels 
ocean fertilization  
main article 
ocean fertilization or ocean nourishment is a type of climate engineering based on the purposeful introduction of nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  a number of techniques  including fertilization by iron  urea and phosphorus have been proposed 
example co2 scrubbing chemistry  
main article 
calcium oxide  
 quicklime  will absorb co2 from
mixed with
at 400c  forming   and release it at 1,000c  this process  proposed by   can be performed using
from thermal   quicklime is made by heating limestone to release the co2 within it  quicklime is mixed with sand for brick building as mortar  where it hardens by absorption of co2 
potassium hydroxide  
zeman and lackner outlined a specific method of air capture using   carbon engineering  a calgary  alberta firm founded in 2009 and partially funded by   is developing a process to capture carbon dioxide using a solution of potassium hydroxide mixed with some water at their
  they hope to create and sell synthetic fuels at a cost of  100 a ton 
economic issues  
a crucial issue for cdr methods is their cost  which differs substantially among the different technologies  some of these are not sufficiently developed to perform cost assessments  the
estimates the costs for direct air capture to be  600 tonne with optimistic assumptions  the iea greenhouse gas r d programme and
provides an estimate that 3.5 billion tonnes could be removed annually from the atmosphere with
 bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  at carbon prices as low as 50  whereas a report from
and the
estimates costs  below 100  per tonne for large scale beccs deployment 
risks  problems and criticisms  
cdr is slow to act  and requires a long-term political and engineering program to effect  cdr is even slower to take effect on   in a business as usual   the deep ocean will remain acidified for centuries  and as a consequence many marine species are in danger of extinction
