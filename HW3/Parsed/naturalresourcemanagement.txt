natural resource management refers to the management of
such as      
and   with a particular focus on how management affects the
for both present and future generations    
natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural
interact  it brings together land use planning  water management    and the future sustainability of industries like      
and   it recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes  and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity 
natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and
and the life-supporting capacity of those resources 
is also similar to natural resource management  in academic contexts  the
is closely related to  but distinct from  natural resource management

history  
the
in the united states manages america s   totaling approximately 264 million acres  1,070,000 km2  or one-eighth of the landmass of the country 
the emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of
in the late 19th century  and the
movement of the same time  this type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist
strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources  a more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social  cultural  economic and political aspects of resource management  a more holistic  national and even global form evolved  from the
and the advocacy of  
in 2005 the government of   established a standard for quality natural resource management  to improve the consistency of practice  based on an
approach 
in the   the most active areas of natural resource management are
often associated with
and   in   water sharing  such as the
and
are also significant 
ownership regimes  
natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of   natural resources 
state property
private property
common property
non-property  open access 
hybrid
state property regime  
ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state  individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources  but only at the permission of the state  national forest  national parks and military reservations are some us examples 
private property regime  
any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity  both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner s   private land is the most common example 
common property regimes  
it is a private property of a group  the group may vary in size  nature and internal structure e g  indigenous neighbours of village  some examples of common property are community forests 
non-property regimes  open access   
there is no definite owner of these properties  each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish  these areas are the most exploited  it is said that  everybody s property is nobody s property   an example is a lake fishery 
may exist without ownership  in which case in the uk it is vested in a local authority 
hybrid regimes  
many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above  so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes  an example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in nsw  australia  where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation  but where most native vegetation exists on private land 
stakeholder analysis  
originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into
management in ever growing popularity  stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources 
there is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below  especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder

development
therefore  it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised 
billgrena and holme identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management 
identify and categorise the stakeholders that may have influence
develop an understanding of why changes occur
establish who can make changes happen
how to best manage natural resources
this gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions  there are numerous stakeholder theories such as mitchell et al  however grimble created a framework of stages for a stakeholder analysis in natural resource management  grimble designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management 
stages in stakeholder analysis 
clarify objectives of the analysis
place issues in a systems context
identify decision-makers and stakeholders
investigate stakeholder interests and agendas
investigate patterns of inter-action and dependence  e g  conflicts and compatibilities  trade-offs and synergies 
application 
grimble and wellard established that stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as 
cross-cutting systems and stakeholder interests
multiple uses and users of the resource 
and temporal trade-offs
unclear or
untraded products and services
and under-representation
case studies 
in the case of the   a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people s livelihoods and loss of life 
nepal  indonesia and koreas 
are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources  this allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests 
criticisms 
natural resource management stakeholder analysis tends to include too many stakeholders which can create problems in of its self as suggested by clarkson  stakeholder theory should not be used to weave a basket big enough to hold the world s misery 
starik proposed that nature needs to be represented as stakeholder  however this has been rejected by many scholars as it would be difficult to find appropriate representation and this representation could also be disputed by other stakeholders causing further issues 
stakeholder analysis can be used exploited and abused in order to marginalise other stakeholders 
identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions 
on-going conflicts and lack of trust between stakeholders can prevent compromise and resolutions 
alternatives  complementary forms of analysis 
management of the resources  
natural resource management issues are inherently complex they involve the ecological cycles  hydrological cycles  climate  animals  plants and geographetc  all these are dynamic and inter-related  a change in one of them may have far reaching and or long term impacts which may even be irreversible  in addition to the natural systems  natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests  policies  politics  geographical boundaries  economic implications and the list goes on  it is very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time  this results in conflicting situations 
after the united nations conference for the environment and development  unced  held in rio de janeiro in 1992  most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land  water  and forests  although program names vary from nation to nation  all express similar aims

community-based natural resource management  
the community-based natural resource management  cbnrm  approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities  the three key assumptions being that  locals are better placed to conserve natural resources  people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation  and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life  when a local people s quality of life is enhanced  their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced  regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of  
the united nations advocates cbnrm in the convention on biodiversity and the convention to combat desertification  unless clearly defined  decentralised nrm can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e g  forest communities in central kalimantan  indonesia  
a problem of cbnrm is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development  biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation  the concept and conflicting interests of cbnrm  show how the motives behind the participation are differentiated as either people-centred  active or participatory results that are truly empowering  or planner-centred  nominal and results in passive recipients   understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based nrm  locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits 
cbnrm is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities  on the one hand  and national and transnational organizations  on the other  to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues  employment  diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity  cbnrm has raised new challenges  as concepts of community  territory  conservation  and indigenous are worked into politically varied plans and programs in disparate sites  warner and jones address strategies for effectively managing conflict in cbnrm 
the capacity of
communities to conserve natural resources has been acknowledged by the australian government with the caring for country program  caring for our country is an australian government initiative jointly administered by the australian government department of agriculture  fisheries and forestry and the department of the environment  water  heritage and the arts  these departments share responsibility for delivery of the australian government s environment and sustainable agriculture programs  which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of natural resource management 
these programs have been delivered regionally  through 56 state government bodies  successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions 
governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management  in the state of nsw  the 13
 cmas  are overseen by the
 nrc   responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs 
adaptive management  
the primary methodological approach adopted by
 cmas  for regional natural resource management in australia is  
this approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of plan-do-review-act  it also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice 
determination of scale
collection and use of knowledge
monitoring and evaluation
opportunities for  
integrated natural resource management  
integrated natural resource management  inrm  is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way  which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use  biophysical  socio-political  and economic  meet production goals of producers and other direct users  e g   food security  profitability  risk aversion  as well as goals of the wider community  e g   poverty alleviation  welfare of future generations  environmental conservation   it focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself  reducing possible future conflicts  the conceptual basis of inrm has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use  participatory planning  integrated watershed management  and adaptive management  inrm is being used extensively and been successful in regional and community based natural management

frameworks and modelling  
there are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management 
geographic information systems  gis 
is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links  a bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall  cleared land and erosion  in australia  metadata directories such as ndar provide data on australian natural resources such as vegetation  fisheries  soils and water  these are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation 
natural resources management audit frameworks
the nsw government in australia has published an audit framework for natural resource management  to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management  this audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies  including  
and   audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders  identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public 
the australian government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting  which closely follows australian standards for assurance engagements 
the australian government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management  focussing on the implementation of the murray darling basin plan 
other elements  
biodiversity conservation
the issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management  what is biodiversity  biodiversity is a comprehensive concept  which is a description of the extent of natural diversity  gaston and spicer  p 3  point out that biodiversity is  the variety of life  and relate to different kinds of  biodiversity organization   according to gray  p 154   the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity  was put forward by the united nations in 1992  involving different aspects of biological diversity 
precautionary biodiversity management
the  threats  wreaking havoc on biodiversity include  habitat fragmentation  putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources  forest deterioration and deforestation  the invasion of  alien species  and  climate change   p 2   since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public  the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management  according to cooney  there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management 
concrete  policy tools 
cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on  evidences   relating to  high standard of proof   the forbidding of special  activities  and  information and monitoring requirements   before making the policy of precaution  categorical evidence is needed  when the potential menace of  activities  is regarded as a critical and  irreversible  endangerment  these  activities  should be forbidden  for example  since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment  the south africa marine living resources act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to  catch fish  by using explosives and toxicants 
administration and guidelines
according to cooney  there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management 
1   ecosystem based management  including  more risk-averse and precautionary management   where  given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure  function  and inter-specific interactions  precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management  
2   adaptive management  is  a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems  
3   environmental impact assessment  and exposure ratings decrease the  uncertainties  of precaution  even though it has deficiencies  and
4   protectionist approaches   which  most frequently links to  biodiversity conservation in natural resources management 
land management
in order to have a sustainable environment  understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important  in terms of understanding  young emphasises some important points of land management 
comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem  water  soils
using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations
cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills
dale et al   2000  study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them  the ecological principles relate to time  place  species  disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways it is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines 
examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context  and the effects on natural resources 
plan for long-term change and unexpected events 
preserve rare landscape elements and associated species 
avoid land uses that deplete natural resources 
retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats 
minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species 
avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes 
implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area
