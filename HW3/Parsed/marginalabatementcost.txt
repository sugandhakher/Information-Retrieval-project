marginal abatement cost
carbon related
abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution  marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit  the marginal abatement cost  mac   in general  measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution 
although marginal abatement costs can be negative  such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option  macs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced 
marginal abatement costs are typically used on a marginal abatement cost curve or mac curve  which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution

usage  
carbon traders use mac curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals  power companies may employ mac curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options  economists have used mac curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading  policy-makers use mac curves as
curves  to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost  and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions 
however  mac curves should not be used as abatement supply curves  or
curves  to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target  indeed  the options they list would take decades to implement  and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures 
criticism  
the way that mac curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty  inter-temporal dynamics  interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits 
examples of existing mac curves  
various economists  research organizations  and consultancies have produced mac curves  bloomberg new energy finance and
have produced economy wide analyses on greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the  
produced a california specific curve following
legislation as have sweeney and weyant 
the
produced several marginal abatement cost curves for germany  also called cost potential curves   depending on the perspective  end-user  utilities  society  
the us
has done work on a mac curve for non carbon dioxide emissions such as methane  n2o  and hfcs  enerdata and lepii-cnrs  france  produce mac curves with the
model for the 6 kyoto protocol gases  these curves have been used for various public and private actors either to assess carbon policies
or through the use of a carbon market analysis tool
