history  
this section needs expansion  you can help by    november 2013 
in november 1776  methane was first scientifically identified by
physicist
in the marshes of
straddling
and   volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by
about  flammable air   volta captured the gas rising from the marsh  and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas  he also demonstrated means to ignite the gas with an electric spark 
the name  methane  was coined in 1866 by the german chemist  
properties and bonding  
methane is a
molecule with four equivalent   its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals  mos  resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on
and   the lowest energy mo is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms  above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of mos that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen  the resulting  three-over-one  bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements 
at

solid methane exists in several   presently nine are known  cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane i  this substance crystallizes in the cubic system   fm3m   the positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane i  i e  methane molecules may rotate freely  therefore  it is a  
chemical reactions  
the primary chemical reactions of methane are  
to   and   in general  methane reactions are difficult to control  partial oxidation to   for example  is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to
and
even with an insufficient supply of oxygen  the enzyme
produces methanol from methane  but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions 
acid-base reactions  
like other   methane is a very weak acid  its pka in

a variety of

initiator  a chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine  which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane  resulting in the formation of hydrogen chloride  the resulting methyl radical  ch3  can combine with another chlorine molecule to give
 ch3cl  and a chlorine atom  this chlorine atom can then react with another methane  or methyl chloride  molecule  repeating the chlorination cycle  similar reactions can produce
 ch2cl2

 ccl4   depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio 
uses  
methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid  liquefied natural gas  or    while leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas  the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air

liquefied natural gas  
main article 
liquefied natural gas  lng  is
 predominantly methane  ch4  that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport 
liquefied natural gas takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state  it is    
and   hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state  freezing  and  
the
process involves removal of certain components  such as dust      water  and heavy   which could cause difficulty downstream  the natural gas is then
into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure  maximum transport pressure set at around 25kpa or 3.6psi  by cooling it to approximately 162c  260f    
lng achieves a higher reduction in volume than
 cng  so that the
of lng is 2.4times greater than that of cng or 60  that of   this makes lng cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist  specially designed
sea vessels    or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport 
lng  when it is not highly refined for special uses  is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets  where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas  it is also beginning to be used in   for example 
in commercial operation have been achieving
of approximately four years on the higher initial investment required in lng equipment on the trucks and lng infrastructure to support fueling  however  it remains more common to design vehicles to use   as of 2002  the relatively higher cost of lng production and the need to store lng in more expensive
had slowed widespread commercial use

rockets using liquid methane have been proposed  one 1990s russian engine proposal was the   a methane  variant of the

lunar return engine  before the cev program was later cancelled 
more recently the
company

  raptor is being designed to produce 4.4 meganewtons  1,000,000lbf  of thrust with a vacuum
 isp  of 363 seconds and a sea-level isp of 321 seconds  and began component-level testing in 2014  in february 2014  the raptor engine design was shown to be of the highly efficient and theoretically more reliable
cycle type  where both propellant streamsoxidizer and fuelare completely in the
before they enter the   prior to 2014  only two full-flow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands  but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle  in 2016  a development raptor engine was tested 
in october 2013  the   a state-owned contractor for the   announced that it had completed a first ignition test on a new lox methane rocket engine  no engine size was provided 
in september 2014  another
company publicly announced that they were into their third year of development work on a large methane rocket engine  the new engine  the blue engine 4  or   has been designed to produce 2,400
 550,000  of thrust  while initially planned to be used exclusively on a blue origin proprietary launch vehicle  it will now be used on a new
 ula  engine on an
that is a successor to the   ula indicated in 2014 that they will make the maiden flight of the new launch vehicle no earlier than 2019 
one advantage of methane is that it is abundant in many parts of the solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body  in particular  using
found on

by 2013  nasa s
had developed a small restartable lox methane rocket engine with 5,000 pounds-force  22kn  thrust and a specific impulse of 321 seconds suitable for inspace applications including landers  small lox methane thrusters 515 pounds-force  2267n  were also developed suitable for use in a

by mid-2015    with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026 
chemical feedstock  
although there is great interest in converting methane into useful or more easily liquefied compounds  the only practical processes are relatively unselective  in the chemical industry  methane is converted to   a mixture of

catalysts and requires high temperatures  around 7001100c

on mars  
methane has been proposed as a possible rocket propellant on future mars missions due in part to the possibility of synthesizing it on the planet via  
an adaptation of the sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars  utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere 
methane could also be produced by a non-biological process called
involving water  carbon dioxide  and the mineral   which is known to be common on mars

cornell  clayton b   april 29  2008     compressed natural gas is touted as the  cleanest burning  alternative fuel available  since the simplicity of the methane molecule reduces tailpipe emissions of different pollutants by 35 to 97   not quite as dramatic is the reduction in net greenhouse-gas emissions  which is about the same as corn-grain ethanol at about a 20  reduction over gasoline
