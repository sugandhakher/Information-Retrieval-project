regulated sources  
many emissions standards focus on regulating pollutants released by
 motor cars  and other powered   others regulate emissions from   power plants  small equipment such as lawn mowers and diesel   and other sources of  
vehicle emission performance standard

an emission performance standard is a limit that sets thresholds above which a different type of emission control technology might be needed  while emission performance standards have been used to dictate limits for conventional
such as
and
 nox and sox   this regulatory technique may be used to regulate   particularly
 co2   in the us  this is given in pounds of carbon dioxide per
 lbs  co2 mwhr   and kilograms co2 mwhr elsewhere

in   the canadian environmental protection act  1999  cepa 1999  transfers the legislative authority for regulating emissions from on-road vehicles and engines to
from transport canada s motor vehicle safety act  the regulations align emission standards with the u s  federal standards and apply to light-duty vehicles  e g   passenger cars   light-duty trucks  e g   vans  pickup trucks  sport utility vehicles   heavy-duty vehicles  e g   trucks and buses   heavy-duty engines and motorcycles

in the   emissions standards are managed by the
 epa   under federal law  the state of
is allowed to promulgate more stringent vehicle emissions standards  subject to epa approval   and other states may choose to follow either the national or california standards  california had produced air quality standards prior to epa  with severe
metropolitan area  la is the country s second-largest city  and relies much more heavily on automobiles and has less favorable meteorological conditions than the largest and third-largest cities  new york and chicago  
california s emissions standards are set by the   known locally by its acronym  carb   by mid-2009  16 other states had adopted carb rules  given the size of the california market plus these other states  many manufacturers choose to build to the carb standard when selling in all 50 states  carb s policies have also influenced eu emissions standards   
california is attempting to regulate
emissions from automobiles  but faces a court challenge from the federal government  the states are also attempting to compel the federal epa to regulate
emissions  which as of 2007 it has declined to do  on may 19  2009
indicate that the federal epa will largely adopt california s standards on greenhouse gas emissions 
california and several other western states have passed bills requiring
of greenhouse gases from electricity generation 
in an effort to decrease emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines faster  the  s
funds upgrades that are in advance of regulations 
the california arb standard for light vehicle emissions is a regulation of equipment first  with verification of emissions second  the property owner of the vehicle is not permitted to modify  improve  or innovate solutions in order to pass a true emissions only standard set for their vehicle  therefore  california s attempt at regulation of emissions is a regulation of equipment not of air quality  this form of regulation prevents most grassroots type creative individuals from participating in the math science and engineering that could lead to breakthroughs in this area of research  they are wholly excluded from modifying their property in any way that has not been extensively researched and approved by carb  this could be entirely prevented by regulating and testing emissions only 
the epa has separate regulations for small engines  such as   the states must also promulgate miscellaneous emissions regulations in order to comply with the

the european union has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet  currently  standards are set for all road vehicles  trains  barges and  nonroad mobile machinery   such as tractors   no standards apply to seagoing ships or airplanes 
eu regulation no 443/2009 sets an average co2 emissions target for new passenger cars of 130 grams per kilometre  the target is gradually being phased in between 2012 and 2015  a target of 95 grams per kilometre will apply from 2021 
for light commercial vehicle  an emissions target of 175 g km applies from 2017  and 147 g km from 2020  a reduction of 16

india  
main article 
bharat stage emission standards are emission standards instituted by the government of india to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engine equipment  including motor vehicles  the standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the central pollution control board under the ministry of environment   forests 
the standards  based on european regulations were first introduced in 2000  progressively stringent norms have been rolled out since then  all new vehicles manufactured after the implementation of the norms have to be compliant with the regulations  as of 2014  the country is under a combination of euro 3 and euro 4-based norms  euro 6 norms are planned to be introduced across the country by the april 1  2020 
japan  
background
starting june 10  1968  the japanese government passed the      which regulated all sources of air pollutants  as a result of the 1968 law  dispute resolutions were passed under the 1970       as a result of the 1970 law  in 1973 the first installment of four sets of new emissions standards were introduced  interim standards were introduced on january 1  1975 and again for 1976  the final set of standards were introduced for 1978  while the standards were introduced they were not made immediately mandatory  instead tax breaks were offered for cars which passed them  the standards were based on those adopted by the original
of 1970  but the test cycle included more slow city driving to correctly reflect the japanese situation  the 1978 limits for mean emissions during a  hot start test  of co  hydrocarbons  and nox were 2.1 grams per kilometre  3.38g mi  of co   25 grams per kilometre  0.40g mi  of hc  and  25 grams per kilometre  0.40g mi  of nox respectively  maximum limits are 2.7 grams per kilometre  4.35g mi  of co   39 grams per kilometre  0.63g mi  of hc  and  48 grams per kilometre  0.77g mi  of nox  the    test  used to determine individual fuel economy ratings and emissions observed from the vehicle being tested  use a specific testing regime 
in 1992  to cope with nox pollution problems from existing vehicle fleets in highly populated metropolitan areas  the ministry of the environment adopted the       called in short the motor vehicle nox law  the regulation designated a total of 196 communities in the tokyo  saitama  kanagawa  osaka and hyogo prefectures as areas with significant air pollution due to nitrogen oxides emitted from motor vehicles  under the law  several measures had to be taken to control nox from in-use vehicles  including enforcing emission standards for specified vehicle categories 
the regulation was amended in june 2001 to tighten the existing nox requirements and to add pm control provisions  the amended rule is called the law concerning special measures to reduce the total amount of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emitted from motor vehicles in specified areas  or in short the automotive nox and pm law 
emission standards
the nox and pm law introduces emission standards for specified categories of in-use highway vehicles including commercial goods  cargo  vehicles such as trucks and vans  buses  and special purpose motor vehicles  irrespective of the fuel type  the regulation also applies to diesel powered passenger cars  but not to gasoline cars  
in-use vehicles in the specified categories must meet 1997/98 emission standards for the respective new vehicle type  in the case of heavy duty engines nox   4.5 g kwh  pm   0.25 g kwh   in other words  the 1997/98 new vehicle standards are retroactively applied to older vehicles already on the road  vehicle owners have two methods to comply 
replace old vehicles with newer  cleaner models
retrofit old vehicles with approved nox and pm control devices
vehicles have a grace period  between 8 and 12 years from the initial registration  to comply  the grace period depends on the vehicle type  as follows 
light commercial vehicles  gvw  2500kg   8 years
heavy commercial vehicles  gvw   2500kg   9 years
micro buses  11-29 seats   10 years
large buses   30 seats   12 years
special vehicles  based on a cargo truck or bus   10 years
diesel passenger cars  9 years
furthermore  the regulation allows fulfillment of its requirements to be postponed by an additional 0.5-2.5 years  depending on the age of the vehicle  this delay was introduced in part to harmonize the nox and pm law with the tokyo diesel retrofit program 
the nox and pm law is enforced in connection with japanese vehicle inspection program  where non-complying vehicles cannot undergo the inspection in the designated areas  this  in turn  may trigger an injunction on the vehicle operation under the road transport vehicle law

south africa  
south africas first clean fuels programme was implemented in 2006 with the banning of lead from petrol and the reduction of sulphur levels in diesel from 3 000 parts per million  ppm  to 500ppm  along with a niche grade of 50ppm 
the clean fuels 2 standard  expected to begin in 2017  includes the reduction of sulphur to 10ppm  the lowering of benzene from 5 percent to 1 percent of volume  the reduction of aromatics from 50 percent to 35 percent of volume  and the specification of olefins at 18 percent of volume
