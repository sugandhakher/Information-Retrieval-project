sustainable living is a
that attempts to reduce an  s or  s use of the  s
and personal resources  practitioners of sustainable living often attempt to reduce their
by altering methods of     and   proponents of sustainable living aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with   in natural balance and respectful of humanity s
relationship with the earth s natural
and cycles  the practice and general philosophy of ecological living is highly interrelated with the overall principles of  
  a prominent
and founder of the

sustainable living is fundamentally the application of
to lifestyle choice and decisions  one conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological  societal  and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations  another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains  economics  ecology  politics and culture  in the first conception  sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors  in the second or
conception  sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life  including consequences for future human generations and non-human  
and
are critical factors to sustainable living  sustainable design encompasses the development of   which is a staple of sustainable living practices  sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure 
and
are the most common examples of this practice

emissions embodied in household purchases and 26  of households   
are built using sustainable methods  materials  and facilitate green practices  enabling a more sustainable lifestyle  their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the earth  often  if necessary  they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores  schools  daycares  work  or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices  sometimes  they are
homes that do not require any public energy  water  or sewer service 
if not off-the-grid  sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources  buying power as is normal convention  additionally  sustainable homes may be connected to a grid  but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility  there are two common methods to approaching this option  net metering and double metering 
net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes  running forward when power is used from the grid  and running backward when power is put into the grid  which allows them to net out their total energy use  putting excess energy into the grid when not needed  and using energy from the grid during peak hours  when you may not be able to produce enough immediately   power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid  as it is being produced  double metering involves installing two meters  one measuring electricity consumed  the other measuring electricity created  additionally  or in place of selling their renewable energy  sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries  this gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times  i e   night-time  when there has been no wind  etc    and to be completely independent of the  
sustainably designed  see   houses
are generally sited so as to create as little of a negative impact on the surrounding
as possible  oriented to the sun so that it creates the best possible
 typically  the long axis of the house or building should be oriented east-west   and provide natural shading or wind barriers where and when needed  among many other considerations  the design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later  i e   using   creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches  deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates  etc   sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting  use non-toxic and renewable  recycled  reclaimed  or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion  such as using organic or water-based finishes   use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation  and use low-impact production methods  methods that minimize effects on the environment  
many materials can be considered a green material until its background is revealed  any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing  such as
in glues used in woodworking   has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer  or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green  in order for any material to be considered green  it must be resource efficient  not compromise
or   and be energy efficient  both in processing and when in use in the shelter   resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content  reusable or recyclable content  materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging  locally available material  salvaged or remanufactured material  material that employs resource efficient manufacturing  and long-lasting material as possible 
sustainable building materials  
some building materials might be considered  sustainable  by some definitions and under some conditions  for example  wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using   processed using   delivered by   etc   under different conditions  however  it might not be considered as sustainable  the following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions  based on a  
composite wood  when made from reclaimed hardwood sawdust and reclaimed or recycled plastic 
lumber from
approved sources

soy insulation
of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home  well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or  in combination with a house that is well designed  eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether  installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used  typically  lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters  walls with cavities are done in much the same manner  for walls that do not have cavities behind them  solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install  energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation  simply assuring that windows  and doors  are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home  double or triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows  trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out 
or low-e glass is another option for window insulation  it is a coating on windowpanes of a thin  transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source  keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer  simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation  superwindows  mentioned in   became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies  including two to three transparent low-e coatings  multiple panes of glass  and a heavy gas filling  although more expensive  they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows 
equipping roofs with highly reflective material  such as aluminum  increases a roof s
and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs  hence  the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on 
or living roofs are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building  they are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and  when in the broader picture of a community  reduce the heat island effect  see   thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area  it is arguable that they are able to replace the physical footprint that the building creates  helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the buildings presence 
energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing  if using appliances  computers 
systems  electronics  or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an
label  which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law  ideally  a sustainable shelter should be able to completely run the appliances it uses using renewable energy and should strive to have a neutral impact on the earths water sources
  including water from washing machines  sinks  showers  and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation  likewise 
from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter 
replicate the natural systems that clean water in wildlife and implement them in a citys drainage system so as to minimize contaminated water and unnatural rates of runoff into the environment

as mentioned under shelter  some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy  while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources  also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household   purchasing sustainable energy  however  may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability  6 out of the 50 states in the us do not offer green energy  for example  for those that do  its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid  technically  in this case  the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it  in this case  it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity  this may or may not depend on the amount being purchased  the purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utilitys effort in producing sustainable energy  producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible  but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford  some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it  
when generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid  in participating countries such as the us and germany   producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility  additionally  utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy   in some special cases  producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate  but this is not common

solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity  two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are
that are organized into panels and   which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an
via a
or   or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells  the energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a
and has to be converted to
before it can be used in a household  at this point  users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use  or use an ac dc inverter for immediate use  to get the best out of a solar panel  the
of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees  solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy  but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases  it has the advantages of being portable  easy to use on an individual basis  readily available for government grants and incentives  and being flexible regarding location  though it is most efficient when used in hot  arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny   for those that are lucky  affordable rental schemes may be found  concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale  because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a  
is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun  one of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through   in a broad perspective  these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors  are either passive or active systems  active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank  and  in active systems  involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used  passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system  instead  they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank  
other methods of harnessing solar power are
 for heating internal building spaces   solar drying  for drying wood chips  fruits  grains  etc        and other
technologies  simply  harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means  
wind power is harnessed through turbines  set on tall towers  typically 20 or 6m with 10 or 3m diameter blades for an individual households needs  that power a generator that creates electricity  they typically require an average of wind speed of 9mi hr  14km hr  to be worth their investment  as prescribed by the us department of energy   and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes  wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30  10m  in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions  such as neighboring buildings   mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities  wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce  their appearance  and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds  their blades obstruct passage in the sky   wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt  approaching the cost of fossil fuels  and have quick paybacks 
for those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed  or falling from an adequate height  on their property 
may be an option  on a large scale  hydroelectricity  in the form of dams  has adverse environmental and social impacts  when on a small scale  however  in the form of single turbines  hydroelectricity is very sustainable  single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive  on an individual household basis  single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route  but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production   it is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household 
geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earths surface  in reservoirs  to produce energy  because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir  this source is considered sustainable  however  those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited  they cool down over time  making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible   this method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment  there do exist small individual scale geothermal operations  however  which harness reservoirs very close to the earths surface  avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression  in this case  the heat is captured and sent to a
system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it  often  this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months   although geothermal energy is available everywhere on earth  practicality and cost-effectiveness varies  directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs  places such as the philippines  hawaii  alaska  iceland  california  and nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the earths surface  making its production cost-effective 
biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel  as with the case of using green materials in a household  it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation  although burning biomass for fuel releases   sulfur compounds  and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere  a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle  the amount that is released is sustainable  it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere   this is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime  however  burning
and bioethanol  see   when created from virgin material  is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty  the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields  the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food   and may use unsustainable growing methods  such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers

digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production  materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity  methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills  full of decomposing waste  and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well  the advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere  exacerbating the greenhouse effect  although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale  done in landfills   it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well 
food  
globally  food accounts for 48  and 70  of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively  with consumption of meat  dairy and processed food rising fast with income 
environmental impacts of industrial agriculture  
is highly resource and energy intensive  industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy   extensive
and   intensive   concentrated
production  and other continual inputs  as a result of these industrial farming conditions  todays mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated  these stresses include  declining   chemical   chemical       loss in   and other ecological concerns 
conventional food distribution and long distance transport  
food distribution and long distance transport are additionally
and
exhaustive  substantial climate-disrupting   boosted by the transport of food over long distances  are of growing concern as the world faces such
as
depletion 
and   the average american meal currently costs about 1500 miles  and takes about 10
of oil and other
to produce a single calorie of food 
local and seasonal foods  
a more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally  buying food from local farmers reduces   caused by long-distance food transport  and stimulates the local economy  local  small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage    fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications  adapting a more regional  seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport  these vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable   thus 
farming does not require energy intensive
production  extensive irrigation  plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods  and other environmental stressors  local  seasonal produce is typically fresher  unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious  local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling    public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce  are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions  as well as promoting localization of food  farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction  another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local
 csa   a csa consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production  csa s usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits  sometimes including dairy products  meat and special food items such as baked goods  considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis  the united states and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine  local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic  economical  and sociopolitical disasters were to occur 
reducing meat consumption  
industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as  
and depletion of   especially pertaining to water and food  mass meat production increase the amount of methane in the atmosphere  for more information on the
and consumption  see the   reducing meat consumption  perhaps to a few meals a week  or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet  alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production  buying and consuming organically raised 
or
is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption 
organic farming  
purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living 
is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability  according to the
 nosb  
is defined as  an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity  biological cycles  and soil biological activity  it is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore  maintain  or enhance ecological harmony  the primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life  plants  animals and people   upon sustaining these goals  organic agriculture uses techniques such as      
and   in addition  organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides 
such as   livestock  
and   organically farmed products include vegetables  fruit  grains  herbs  meat  dairy  eggs  fibers  and flowers  see

in addition to local  small-scale farms  there has been a recent emergence in
expanding from
to private   with this trend  both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in   a network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities  with every bite of food raised from urban gardens  negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways  for instance  vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of
required for industrial agricultural operations  the nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables  nitrogen fertilizer also produces   a more damaging
than   local  community-grown food also requires no imported  long-distance transport which further depletes our
reserves  in developing more efficiency per land acre  urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas  in vacant lots  public parks  private yards  church and school yards  on roof tops     and many other places  communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible  aesthetically pleasing
plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes  grapevines trained on an arbor  pecan trees  etc  with as small a scale as home or community farming  sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized  such sustainable  organic farming techniques include

food preservation and storage  
preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry  home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year  enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket  food can be preserved and saved by

a major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without    unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind  currently  humans use one-fourth of the earths total fresh water in natural circulation  and over half the accessible   additionally 
and water demand is ever increasing  thus  it is necessary to use available water more efficiently  in sustainable living  one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple  everyday measures  these measures involve considering indoor
efficiency  outdoor water use  and daily water use awareness 
indoor home appliances  
housing and
account for 12 percent of americas freshwater withdrawals  a typical american single family home uses about 70 us gallons  260l  per person per day indoors  this use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to
quality 
toilets  
accounted for almost 30  of residential indoor water use in the united states in 1999  one flush of a standard u s  toilet requires more water than most individuals  and many families  in the world use for all their needs in an entire day  a homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways  improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet  to improve the current toilet  one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank  also  there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase  a tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank  a
attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets  it allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level  saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush  a major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks  a slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye  but can waste hundreds of gallons each month  one way to check this is to put food dye in the tank  and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color  in the event of a leaky flapper  one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper  which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush 
if installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model  a
uses one to two gallons per flush  traditionally  toilets use three to five gallons per flush  if an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place  70  of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30   it is possible to have a toilet that uses no water  a
treats human waste through
and   producing a valuable soil additive  these toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces  the urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer  the feces can be dried and bagged or composted  these toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup  in addition to providing valuable fertilizer  these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment  as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve  
additionally  one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing  for instance  instead of flushing small wastes  such as tissues  one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost 
showers  
on average  showers were 18  of u s  indoor water use in 1999  at 68 us gallons  2330l  per minute traditionally in america  a simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow  high-performance showerheads  these showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less  an alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter  this device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature 
can be used to obtain optimal water temperature  and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels  to lessen excess water use  water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation  this insulation decreases hot water generation time  a simple  straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers  one method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary  such as while lathering  and resuming the shower when water is necessary  this can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting  common in the uk but not the united states  
dishwashers and sinks  
on average  sinks were 15  of u s  indoor water use in 1999  there are  however  easy methods to rectify excessive water loss  available for purchase is a screw-on aerator  this device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume  reducing water use by half  additionally  there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature  finally  a
device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half  but can be turned to normal water level when optimal 
in addition to buying the above devices  one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks  and fixing these links if they exist  according to the epa   a small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day  while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons   when washing dishes by hand  it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing  and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously 
on average  dishwashing consumes 1  of indoor water use  when using a   water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full  some have a  low flow  setting to use less water per wash cycle  enzymatic
clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature   
washing machines  
on average  23  of u s  indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing  in contrast to other machines  american
have changed little to become more sustainable  a typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design  in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water  horizontal-axis machines  in contrast  put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it  these machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability 
outdoor water use  
there are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal     and
in more sustainable living  while conserving water is a major element of sustainability  so is sequestering water 
conserving water  
in planning a yard and garden space  it is most sustainable to consider the plants  soil  and available water  drought resistant shrubs  plants  and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species  additionally  native plants  as opposed to herbaceous perennials  will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area 
is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as     and
range  it can reduce landscape water use by 50  70   while providing
space for wildlife  plants on slopes help reduce
by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall  grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste 
after planting  placing a circumference of
surrounding plants functions to lessen   to do this  firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant s dripline  this prevents   when watering  consider the range of sprinklers  watering paved areas is unnecessary  additionally  to conserve the maximum amount of water  watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation  drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system  drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose  leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period  these systems use 30  50  less water than conventional methods  soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90   they connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch  a layer of
added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention  previously planted areas can be covered with  
in caring for a lawn  there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques  a primary aspect of lawn care is watering  to conserve water  it is important to only water when necessary  and to deep soak when watering  additionally  a lawn may be left to go dormant  renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality 
sequestering water  
a common method of water sequestrations is   which incorporates the collection and storage of rain  primarily  the rain is obtained from a roof  and stored on the ground in catchment tanks  water sequestration varies based on extent  cost  and complexity  a simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout  while a more complex method involves multiple tanks  it is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets  additionally  using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff   picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains  the following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply 
collection area  square feet   rainfall  inch year    12  inch foot    cubic feet of water year
cubic feet year  7.43  gallons cubic foot    gallons year
note  however  this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage 
systems function in sequestering used indoor water  such as laundry  bath and sink water  and filtering it for reuse  greywater can be reused in
and toilet flushing  there are two types of greywater systems  gravity fed manual systems and package systems  the manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space  the package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors 
waste  
as populations and resource demands climb  waste production contributes to
of   leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways  and
emissions  in america alone  over the course of a decade  500 trillion pounds of american resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases  thus  a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious  one can do this by reducing waste  reusing commodities  and recycling 
there are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living  two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like
and
and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails  junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009  another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk  reducing packaging materials  preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane  another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint  non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste 
by reusing materials  one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills  reusing saves
by decreasing the necessity of
extraction  for example  reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects 
  a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials  is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods  recycling incorporates three primary processes  collection and processing  manufacturing  and purchasing recycled products  a natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil  which can be carried out at home or locally with community   an offshoot of recycling    strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life  by integrating measures of reusing  reducing  and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner
