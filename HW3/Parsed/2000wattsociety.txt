2000-watt society
the 2000-watt society is an environmental vision  first introduced in 1998 by the
 eth zurich   which pictures the average
citizen reducing their overall average
usage to no more than 2,000
 48
per day  by the year 2050  and without lowering their  
the concept addresses not only personal or household energy use  but the total for the whole society  including   divided by the population 
two thousand watts is approximately the current world average rate of total primary energy use  this compares to averages of around 6,000 watts in   12,000 watts in the   1,500 watts in   1,000 watts in india  500 watts in south africa and only 300 watts in bangladesh  switzerland itself  currently using an average of around 5,000 watts  was last a 2000-watt society in the 1960s 
it is further envisaged that the use of
would be ultimately cut to no more than 500 watts per person within 50 to 100 years 
the vision was developed in response to concerns about     and the future availability of energy supplies  it is supported by the swiss federal office of energy  the association of swiss architects and engineers  and other bodies

implications  
researchers in switzerland believe that this vision is achievable  despite a projected 65  increase in economic growth by 2050  by using new low-carbon technologies and techniques 
it is envisaged that achieving the aim of a 2000-watt society will require  amongst other measures  a complete reinvestment in the country s capital assets  refurbishment of the nation s building stock to bring it up to
standards  significant improvements in the efficiency of  
and energy-intensive material use  the possible introduction of high-speed   the use of
sources   
and related technologies  and a refocusing of research into new priority areas 
as a result of the intensified research and development effort required  it is hoped that switzerland will become a leader in the technologies involved  indeed  the idea has a great deal of government backing  due to fears about climate change 
the basel pilot region  
launched in 2001 and located in the metropolitan area of    pilot region basel  aims to develop and commercialise some of the technologies involved  the pilot is a partnership between industry  universities  research institutes and the authorities  coordinated by     participation is not restricted to locally based organisations  the city of
joined the project in 2005 and the canton of
declared its interest in 2008 
within the pilot region the projects in progress include demonstration buildings constructed to
or
standards 
generation from
sources  and vehicles using  
and   the aim is to put research into practice  seek continuous improvements  and to communicate progress to all interested parties  including the public
