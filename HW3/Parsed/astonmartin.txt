founding
aston martin was founded in 1913 by lionel martin and   the two had joined forces as bamford   martin the previous year to sell cars made by
from premises in callow street  london where they also serviced
and
vehicles  martin raced specials at
near   and the pair decided to make their own vehicles  the first car to be named aston martin was created by martin by fitting a four-cylinder
engine to the chassis of a 1908  
they acquired premises at henniker mews in
and produced their first car in march 1915  production could not start because of the outbreak of   and martin joined the
and bamford the   all machinery was sold to the  
inter war years
after the war  the company was refounded at abingdon road  kensington and a new car designed to carry the aston-martin name  bamford left in 1920 and the company was revitalised with funding from   in 1922  bamford   martin produced cars to compete in the   which went on to set world speed and endurance records at   three works team cars with 16-valve
were built for racing and record breaking  chassis number 1914  later developed as the green pea  chassis number 1915  the
record car  and chassis number 1916  later developed as the  
approximately 55 cars were built for sale in two configurations 
and short chassis  the company went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by lady charnwood  who put her son john benson on the board  the company failed again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926  with lionel martin leaving 
later that year  bill renwick 
and investors which included lady charnwood took control of the company  they renamed it aston martin motors and moved it to the former whitehead aircraft limited works in   renwick and bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead-cam four-cylinder engine using renwick s patented combustion chamber design  which they had tested in an
chassis  the only  renwick and bertelli  motor car made  it was known as  buzzbox  and still survives 
the pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers  but having heard that the aston martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump start the production of a completely new car 
between 1926 and 1937 bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new aston martins  since known as  bertelli cars   they included the 1-litre  t-type    international    le mans    mkii  and its racing derivative  the  ulster   and the 2-litre 15/98 and its racing derivative  the  speed model   most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by bert bertelli s brother   with a small number of long-chassis four-seater tourers  dropheads and saloons also produced 
bertelli was a competent driver keen to race his cars  one of few owner manufacturer drivers  the  lm  team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at le mans and the mille miglia 
financial problems reappeared in 1932  the company was rescued for a year by l  prideaux brune before passing it on to sir arthur sutherland  in 1936  aston martin decided to concentrate on road cars  producing just 700 until
halted work  production shifted to aircraft components during the war 
david brown era
1958 aston martin db mark iii
in 1947  tractor manufacturer
bought the company under the leadership of managing director its  post-war saviour   the company also acquired
that year for its 2.6-litre -designed engine  both companies shared resources and workshops  leading to the classic  db  series of cars  in 1950  the company announced the   followed by the
in 1953  the
in 1955  the
in 1957 and the italian-styled 3.7l
in 1958 
while these models helped aston martin establish a good racing pedigree  the db4 stood out and yielded the famous
in 1963  the company stayed true to its emerging    style with the
 196570   and
 19671972  
the six-cylinder engines of these cars from 1954 up to 1965 were designed by  
1970schanging ownership
the aston martin company was often financially troubled  in 1972  the firm was sold to company developments  a -based consortium chaired by   mbe 
the company was resold in 1975 by its receiver following a further bankruptcy to north american businessmen peter sprague and
for 1.05million  a successful turn-around strategy led to the recruitment of 360 new employees and  by 1977  a trading profit of 750,000  the new owners pushed the company into modernising its line  producing the
in 1977  the convertible
in 1978  and the one-off -styled
in 1980  towns also styled the futuristic new
saloon  based on the v8 model 
in 1980 aston-martin sought to buy   planning to design a new model and offering their take on an updated 1981 model   the acquisition never developed  as the company was badly hit by the economic contraction of the early 1980s  worldwide sales shrank to three cars per week  prompting chairman alan curtis  sprague  and minden to consider shutting down production to concentrate on service and   at this point curtis attended the 1980 pace sponsored
benefit day at   and met fellow
resident  
1980svictor gauntlett
gauntlett bought a 12.5  stake in aston martin for 500,000 via
in 1980  with tim hearley of ch industrials taking a similar share  pace and chi took over as joint 50/50 owners at the beginning of 1981  with gauntlett as executive chairman  gauntlett also led the sales team  and after some development and publicity when it became the world s fastest 4-seater production car  was able to sell the
in oman  kuwait  and qatar 
in 1982  aston martin was granted a
by the     the company holds the warrant to this day 
understanding that it would take some time to develop new aston martin products  they created an engineering service subsidiary to develop automotive products for other companies  it was decided to use the name of the coachbuilding company
which aston martin had owned since 1955  the name being already associated with quality cars in the public perception  products included a tickford   a tickford
and even tickford train interiors  particularly on the   pace continued sponsoring racing events  and now sponsored all aston martin owners club events  taking a tickford-engined nimrod group c car owned by amoc president   which came third in the manufacturers championship in both 1982 and 1983  it also finished seventh in the
race  however  sales of production cars were now at an all-time low of 30 cars produced in 1982 
as trading became tighter in the petroleum market  and aston martin was requiring more time and money  gauntlett agreed to sell hays pace to the kuwait investment office in september 1983  as aston martin required greater investment  he also agreed to sell his share holding to american importer and greek shipping tycoon   who invested via his joint venture company with nick and john papanicolaou  all inc  gauntlett remained chairman of the aml company 55  owned by all  with tickford a 50/50 venture between all and chi  the uneasy relationship was ended when all exercised options to buy a larger share in aml  chi s residual shares were exchanged for chi s complete ownership of tickford  which retained development of existing aston martin projects  in 1984  titan the main shipping company of the papanicolaou s was in trouble  so livanos s father george bought out the papanicolaou s shares in all  while gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25  holding in aml  the deal valued aston martin aml at 2million  the year it built its 10,000th car 
although as a result aston martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant  gauntlett bought a stake in italian styling house   and resurrected its collaboration with aston martin 
aston martin v8 vantage from
in 1986  gauntlett negotiated the return of fictional british secret agent
to aston martin 
had chosen to recast the character using actor   in an attempt to re-root the bond-brand back to a more -like feel  gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production
for use in the filming of   and sold a volante to broccoli for use at his home in america  gauntlett turned down the role of a
colonel in the film  however   i would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time  
the company needed funds to survive in the long term  in may 1987  gauntlett and
were staying at the home of contessa maggi  the wife of the founder of the original   while watching the revival event  another house guest was   vice-president of   despite problems over the previous acquisition of   hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in
taking a share holding in september 1987  in 1988  having produced some 5,000 cars in 20 years  a revived economy and successful sales of limited edition   and 52
coupes at 86,000 each  the company finally retired the ancient v8 and introduced the
rangethe first new aston launched in 20 years 
although gauntlett was contractually to stay as chairman for two years  his racing interests took aston back into sports car racing in 1989 with limited european success  however  with engine rule changes for the 1990 season and the launch of the new
model  ford provided the limited supply of
engines to the
racing team  as the
would require a large engineering input  ford agreed to take full control of aston martin  and gauntlett handed over the company chairmanship to hayes in 1991  in 1992  the
