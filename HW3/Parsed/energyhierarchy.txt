jump to 					 
the energy hierarchy with the most favoured options at the top
part of a series about
the energy hierarchy is a classification of
options  prioritised to assist progress towards a more sustainable energy system  it is a similar approach to the
for minimising resource depletion  and adopts a parallel sequence 
the highest priorities cover the prevention of unnecessary energy usage both through eliminating waste and improving   the sustainable production of energy resources is the next priority  depletive and waste-producing energy generation options are the lowest priority 
for an energy system to be sustainable  the resources applied to producing the energy must be capable of lasting indefinitely 
should produce no harmful by-products  including net emissions  nor wastes which cannot be fully recycled  and it must be capable of meeting reasonable energy demands

energy saving  
main article 
the top priority under the energy hierarchy is energy conservation or the prevention of unnecessary use of energy  this category includes eliminating waste by turning off unneeded lights and appliances and by avoiding unnecessary journeys  heat loss from buildings is a major source of energy wastage  so improvements to building insulation and air-tightness can make a significant contribution to energy conservation 
many countries have agencies to encourage energy saving 
energy efficiency  
the second priority under the energy hierarchy is to ensure that energy that is used is produced and consumed efficiently  energy efficiency has two main aspects 
conversion efficiency of energy consumption  
main article 
energy efficiency is the ratio of the productive output of a device to the energy it consumes 
energy efficiency was a lower priority when energy was cheap and awareness of its environmental impact was low  in 1975 the average fuel economy of a car in the us was under 15 miles per gallon incandescent light bulbs  which were the most common type until the late 20th century  waste 90  of their energy as heat  with only 10  converted to useful light 
more recently  energy efficiency has become a priority  the last reported average fuel efficiency of us cars had almost doubled from the 1975 level  led lighting is now being promoted which are between five and ten times more efficient than incandescents  many household appliances are now required to display
to show their energy efficiency 
conversion efficiency of energy production  
main article 
losses are incurred when energy is harvested from the natural resource from which it is derived  such as fossil fuels  radioactive materials  solar radiation or other sources  most electricity production is in thermal power stations  where much of the source energy is lost as heat  the average efficiency of world electricity production in 2009 was c 37  
a priority in the energy hierarchy is to improve the efficiency of energy conversion  whether in traditional power stations or by improving the
of
and other energy sources 
overall efficiency and sustainability can also be improved by capacity- or
from less efficient  less sustainable resources to better ones  but this is mainly covered under the
of the hierarchy 
sustainable energy production  
main article 
renewable energy describes naturally occurring  theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy  these sources are treated as being inexhaustible  or naturally replenished  and fall into two classes 
elemental renewables  
the first class of renewables derive from climatic or elemental sources  such as sunlight  wind  waves  tides or rainfall  hydro power   geothermal energy from the heat of the earth s core also falls in this category 
these are treated as being inexhaustible because most derive ultimately from energy emanating from the sun  which has an estimated life of 6.5 billion years 
bio-energy  
the other main class of renewables  bioenergy  derives from biomass  where the relatively short growing cycle means that usage is replenished by new growth  bioenergy is usually converted by combustion  and therefore gives rise to carbon emissions  it is treated as carbon neutral overall  because an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide will have been extracted from the atmosphere during the growing cycle 
bioenergy sources can be solid  such as wood and   liquid  such as biofuels  or gaseous  such as biomethane from anaerobic digestion 
low impact energy production  
main article 
the next priority in the hierarchy covers energy sources that are not entirely sustainable  but have a low environmental impact  these include the use of fossil fuels with  
nuclear energy is sometimes treated as a low impact source  because it has low carbon emissions 
high impact energy production  
the lowest priority under the energy hierarchy is energy production using unsustainables sources  such as unabated fossil fuels  some also place nuclear energy in this category  rather than the one above  because of the required management storage of highly hazardous
over extremely long  hundreds of thousands of years or more  timeframes
and depletion of uranium resources 
there is a consensus that the share of such energy sources must decline 
within this tier  there are possibilities for limiting adverse impacts by
from the most damaging fuel sources  such as coal  to less emittive sources  such as gas 
many suggest that when such high impact energy usage has been minimised  the effects of any unavoidable residual usage should be counterbalanced by emissions  
origins of the energy hierarchy  
the energy hierarchy was first proposed in 2005 by   when he was director general of the   this first version had three levels  energy efficiency  renewables and traditional energy production  it was endorsed and adopted in 2006 by a consortium of institutions  associations and other bodies in the sustainable energy manifesto  subsequently the concept has been adopted and refined by others in the energy industry and in government
