the tesla model s is a
five-door 
  produced by   and introduced in june 2012  it scored a perfect 5.0
  as well as being the  third fastest accelerating production car ever produced   and the fastest accelerating car currently in production  the
   official range for the 2012 model s performance model equipped with an 85  310 
is 265 miles  426km   higher than any other electric car at the time  epa rates its energy consumption at 237.5watt-hoursperkilometer  38kwh 100mi or 24kwh 100km  for a combined
of 89
 2.64l 100km or 107mpg-imp  
the model s became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country  twice leading in norway  in september and again in december 2013  and also in denmark in december 2015  global model s sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in december 2015  and almost 145,500 units have been sold worldwide as of september 2016 
the model s ranked as the world s best selling
in 2015  up from second best in 2014  and continued to lead global plug-in car sales during the first nine months of 2016  the model s also ranked as the top selling plug-in electric car in the u s  in 2015  as of december 2015  the leading markets were the united states with a 60  share of global sales and norway with 9.4   other leading country markets are china  the netherlands  canada  denmark  germany  and switzerland  as of june 2016  the model s ranked as the world s second best selling plug-in electric car in history after the  
the tesla model s won awards including the 2013   2013  
magazine s 2013 car of the year 
best 25 inventions of the year 2012 award and
top-scoring car in its road testing  in 2015 
named the model s the car of the century  after declining to recommend the model s in 2015 due to reliability issues  one year later consumer reports added the car to the magazine s recommended list 
in 2016  tesla updated the design of the model s  which now looks more like the   the 60  60d  70  70d  75  75d and 90d versions are available  70 and 70d model s owners have the option to unlock the 75 kwh capacity via a software update  adding up to 19 miles  31km  per charge  the 60 and 60d  reintroduced in june 2016  owners have a us 9,000 anytime option to unlock the full 75 kwh capacity via a software update  in august 2016  tesla introduced the p100d to be the new top-level model  the p100d model has a 100kwh battery  a 060mph  097km h  time of 2.5 seconds and over 300 miles  485km  of epa rated range

history  
tesla model s prototype at the 2009
the model s was styled by   who previously worked for   the car was codenamed whitestar during research and preliminary development 
the model s was announced in a press release on june 30  2008  the prototype vehicle was displayed at a press conference on march 26  2009 
in february 2008 it was reported that tesla motors was planning to offer a
version of its model s  this version would have included a
to extend the driving range of the vehicle  but it was removed in later revisions  at the goinggreen conference in september 2008 tesla s ceo    announced that tesla was developing only electric cars 
construction of an assembly factory in
 a central location for shipping  was supposed to begin in april 2007  but was cancelled  a factory to be built in
was also announced  in may 2010 tesla announced it would produce the model s at the former
assembly plant in fremont  california  now known as the   this third plan was implemented 
the first production tesla model s  with owner tesla board member   in june 2015  three years after the car s market release
in june 2015  three years after the model s introduction and with almost 75,000 model s sedans delivered worldwide  tesla announced that model s owners have accumulated over 1 billion electric miles  1.6 billion km  traveled  and saved more than half a million tons of   the tesla model s is the first plug-in electric vehicle to reach that milestone  in october 2014 general motors reported that volt owners had accumulated a total of 629 million all-electric miles  over 1 billion kilometers  out of a total of 1 billion miles  1.6 billion km  traveled  while nissan reported in december 2014 that leaf owners had traveled 625 million miles  1 billion kilometers   tesla also reported that 68  of model s travel took place in north america  25  in europe and 7  in asia-pacific  global model s sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in december 2015 
in 2016  a racing series called the  electric gt world series  was promoted in preparation for a 2017 racing season using the p85  as a race car on certain traditional tracks  the first season is planned to have 20 cars in 10 teams 
in april 2016  a refresh model s was introduced  the front fascia has with a similar design as the   and also adaptive led headlights were introduced  also  the improved model s has a
air filtration system that removes at least 99.97  of particulate exhaust pollution and all allergens  bacteria  and other contaminants from cabin air  the standard charger was upgraded from 40 to 48 amps in order to enable faster charging when connected to higher-amp outlets  two new interior choices were added  figured ash wood and dark ash wood  these improvements were accompanied by a us 1,500 price increase in the base model 
production

a tesla model s being manufactured at the
tesla manufactures the model s at the 5.4 million square foot
in   for the european market  tesla assembles and distributes from its european distribution center in   the netherlands  cars are built and tested in fremont  california  the battery pack  the electric motor and parts are disassembled and shipped separately to tilburg  where the cars are reassembled  the center occupies a 203,000sqft  18,900m2  industrial building that also serves as a workshop and spare parts warehouse  tesla expects the model s to  pay back  the energy that went into producing the car in fewer than 10,000 miles  16,000km  
the first ten customers received their cars at the fremont factory on june 22  2012 at the official launch  production grew from 1520 cars completed week in august 2012 to about 1,000 cars per week in 2015 
in october 2015  tesla motors announced the company is negotiating with the chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically  local production has the potential to reduce the sales prices of tesla models by a third  a model s starts at us 71,500 in the u s   while in china pricing starts at cn673,000  about us 106,000  after duties and other taxes 
clarified that production will remain in the u s   but if there s sufficient local demand for the
in china  a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model  production in europe will also depend on the region s demand for the model 3

the model s exists in several versions  differing in energy capacity  battery size   power  motor size   and equipment  it is
as a fullsize luxury car in the usa  or as a  large car   120 cu ft or more  or  luxury sedan  by the epa  the
classification is
 sports car   or  oberklasse  in germany

cutaway view of a tesla model s drive motor
a tesla model s p85  using
power in excess of 60kw  during regenerative braking the power indicator is green 
the 2012 tesla model s performance model has a   four pole
416hp  310kw  and 443ftlb  600nm  rear-mounted electric motor with copper   the base model uses a 362hp  270kw  and 325ftlb  440nm  motor  the company claimed a
of  0.24  lower than any car when released 
independent measurement by
in may 2014 bore out tesla s claim by exactly confirming a drag coefficient of cd 0.24 
the rear axle has a traditional   models with dual motors also have an open differential on the front axles as well  the front and rear axles have no mechanical linkage  with dual motors the power distribution among them is controlled  
the model s p90d has a top speed of 155mph  249km h  and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour  0 to 97km h  in 2.8 seconds  despite the lower total motor power  in part due to the improved traction of the all-wheel drive powertrain  the model s p85d  a dual motor all-wheel drive vehicle has a
of 155mph  249km h  and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour  0 to 97km h  in 3.2 seconds  tested to 3.1 seconds   under  insane mode   with 1 of acceleration  new p85ds have an optional  ludicrous mode  hardware package available with the 90 kwh battery upgrade  thus becoming a p90d  that improves the 0 to 60 miles per hour  0 to 97km h  acceleration to 2.8 seconds and 1.1g  tesla initially reported the total output in the p85d as the arithmetic addition of the maximum power of the individual electric motors at 691hp  515kw  but later reported it as 463hp  345kw  because the two motors do not give their maximum power at the same time 
the powertrain also provides regenerative braking power of more than 60kw which reduces both energy consumption and improves brake lifetime 
owners reported many powertrain issues from 2012  improving significantly over the years  in july 2015  tesla announced its goal to make the model s powertrain last for one million miles 
dual-motor all-wheel-drive versions  
on october 9  2014  tesla announced the introduction of all wheel drive  awd  versions of the model s s 60  85  and p85 models  designated by a d at the end of the model number 
on april 8  2015  tesla introduced the model s 70d as its new us 75,000 entry-level car  with all-wheel drive and an improved range of 240 miles  385km   the 70d replaced the 60 and 60d in the model s lineup  with the latter two models no longer being available for purchase  the p85 option was also dropped 
in the 85d  the rear drive unit is replaced by a smaller one to save cost and weight  while a second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels  this results in an
car with comparable power and acceleration to the rwd version while keeping the price increase to us 5,000  additionally  the 85d reports a 2   5-mile  range increase and 11  increase in top speed over the 85  presumably due to incremental improvements in hardware and software   in the p85d  the high-power rear drive unit is retained  while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50   this results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed  the 85kwh version rose from us 81,070 to us 86,070  while the p85  now the p85d  jumped from us 94,570 to us 105,670  deliveries of the p85d started in december 2014  with the 85d models starting in february 2015  and the 70d models starting in april 2015 
on june 9  2016  tesla reintroduced the 60 and 60d  which has a 75kwh battery  locked out to 60kwh but upgradable by software  as is the autopilot option  the spring refresh of 2016 also offers the  bioweapon defense mode  airfilter first offered on the model x 
on august 23  2016  tesla introduced the model s p100d with ludicrous mode as its new us 134,500 top-level car  with all-wheel drive and an improved epa estimated range of 315 miles  505km   this version of the model s is notable for being the first electric vehicle to have a u s  epa estimated range greater than 300 miles  485km  and for being the fastest accelerating vehicle currently in production  with a 060mph  097km h  time of 2.5 seconds  when optioned with ludicrous mode

in 2012  the epa
for the 60kwh battery pack model was 208mi  335km  and the 85kwh battery was 265 miles  426km   according to musk  the model s has a battery with twice the energy density of that on the nissan leaf  but the difference in range is more than double  this is also due to other factors such as drag coefficient  weight  engine efficiency and rolling resistance  musk stated that driving at 65mph  105km h   under normal conditions  gives a reasonable range of 250 miles  400km  
the energy-saving sleep state powers off the display and other vehicle electronics  after the car goes to sleep  this increases the time it takes the touchscreen and instrument panel to become usable  this mode can decrease the loss of the car s range when not being used  2.3mi  3.7km per day  as of 2013  
the 85kwh battery pack weighs 1,200lb  540kg    and contains 7,104
in 16 modules wired in series  14 in the flat section and two stacked on the front   each module contains 6 groups of 74 cells wired in parallel  the 6 groups are then wired in series within the module  as of june 2012  the battery pack used modified
cells with nickel-cobalt-aluminum   each cell was of the 18650 form factor  i e   an 18mm diameter  65mm height cylinder   similar to the panasonic ncr18650b cell that has an energy density of 265wh kg  analysts estimate battery cost to be around 2122  of the car cost  list price for a replacement battery was us 44,000 in february 2015 
the battery is guaranteed for eight years or 125,000 miles  200,000km in metric countries  for the base model with the 60kwh battery pack  the 85kwh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles  a poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss steadies around 5  after 30,000 miles  50,000km   decreasing further about 1  per additional 30,000 miles  unlike nissan  tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss  but some early battery packs have been replaced 
a separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year at a cost of us 10,000 for the 60kwh battery and us 12,000 for the 85kwh battery 
in 2013  tesla canceled a 40kwh version of the car due to lack of demand  stating that only 4  of pre-orders were for the 40kwh battery option  customers who ordered this option instead received the 60kwh pack  with charge software-limited to 40kwh  139 miles  224km   it has the improved acceleration and top speed of the bigger pack and can be upgraded to use the full 60kwh for us 11,000 
on april 8  2015  tesla motors discontinued the model s 60  and replaced the base model with the model s 70 
in 2015  tesla introduced a 70kwh battery to replace the existing 60kwh batteries and base 60kwh model s vehicles  as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers  all 70kwh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or all wheel drive  the 60 was re-introduced in 2016 as a software-limited 75  upgradable to 75 
in july 2015  tesla introduced its 70  90  90d and p90d variants along with a  ludicrous mode  for the performance model  the p90d combines a front axle power of 259 horsepower  193kw  and rear axle power of 503 horsepower  375kw  to a total of 762 horsepower  568kw   for a 060mph time of 2.8 sec  the acceleration of the p90d can reach 1.1  described by tesla as  faster than falling   the  ludicrous mode  costs us 10,000 for p90d  but was discounted to us 5,000 plus labor for p85d owners until january 2016 
in july 2015  tesla introduced its 90 and p90d  a  range upgrade  of the 85 variants with a 90kwh battery and explained the 6  energy increase with  improved cell chemistry  and with the introduction of
into the graphite cell   tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5   tesla also explained that apart from the p90d the model s has its main battery conductor protected by a
rated for 1,300a and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts  to reduce this uncertainty tesla has for the p90d introduced
battery contactors and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse  which monitors the current at the millisecond level  cuts the power with  extreme precision and certainty  and has a rating of 1,500a 
tesla model s showing the front trunk where the engine would be in a typical car  tesla motors calls this a frunk 
in february 2016  the 85 kwh battery option was discontinued in countries including the us  australia and canada 
in march 2016  media reported that a firmware version distributed for the tesla model s has support for a yet to come p100d variant  this battery is more complicated to make than the 90 version  the p100d was released in august 2016 
practicality and livability  
the model s is notable for being designed solely with an electric powertrain in mind  unlike other vehicles where the manufacturer has simply swapped out or supplanted an internal combustion engine with an electric motor  as a result  the model s is able to offer unique features such as a front trunk   frunk   in addition to a spacious rear trunk  with a capacity of 894 liters  and a greatly enlarged front crumple zone compared to the typical combustion engine powered vehicle 
to enhance livability  tesla has developed a network of fast-charging   that allow the driver to quickly and easily top-up the charge on their model s  this supercharger network has rapidly expanded in europe  across the united states  and other countries where the there is significant demand  and as of september 2016  the network has been established in most american states  thus making cross-country and long distance trips in an electric vehicle feasible and greatly alleviating fears of range anxiety  see the
section below for further information 
researchers from the
conducted a study to identify the factors influencing the decision to adopt high-end battery electric vehicles  bev   such as the tesla model s  as these vehicles are remarkably different from mainstream bevs  the 2016 study found that  environmental  performance  and technological motivations are reasons for adoption  the new technology brings a new segment of buyers into the market  and financial purchase incentives are not important in the consumers decision to adopt a high-end bev

battery placement  
in contrast to most other
including the   the battery pack of the model s forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles  providing the vehicle with several advantages  most notably  since the battery pack is the single heaviest component of the vehicle  the model s has a
of only 18 inches  46cm   about the same as a    helping it to achieve a
of 0.9g and good protection against   secondly  the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the
between the axles  lowering
allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight  thirdly  the placement of the battery pack increases the   improving the
of the vehicle  fourth  placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds  either for maintenance or for tesla s battery swap service 
charger  
the model s charge port is located in front of the left taillight 
model s charging connectors at the tesla store in
in all markets the charge port is located behind a door in the left taillight  during charging  the charge port pulses green  the frequency at which the charge port s light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches full  when charging is complete  the light stops pulsing and is solid green 
the model s comes equipped with a different charger and connector in north american versus other markets  derived from differences in the local electric grid systems 
north america  
the standard north american onboard charger accepts single phase 120 or 240-volt sources at a rate of up to 10 kw  included adapters allow the car to charge from a standard 120 volt outlet  a 240 volt nema 14-50 outlet  and
public chargers  an optional us 2,000 upgrade for a second 10 kw onboard charger supports a total of up to 20 kw charging from an 80 amp available us 750 tesla wall connector  the north american connector uses a proprietary tesla design 
charging times vary depending on the battery pack s state-of-charge  its overall capacity  the available voltage  and the available
amperage  from a 120 volt 15 amp household outlet  the range increases by 3.75 miles  6km  for every hour of charging  from a 10 kw 
240 v 50 a outlet  like those used by
or standard cooking ranges   the charge rate is 28.75 miles  46km  per hour  using tesla s 20 kw  240 v high power wall connector increases the rate to 57 miles  92km  per hour if the car is configured with dual chargers  20 kw  
europe   asia pacific  
type 2-compatible inlet on european model s
the standard european charger accepts three phase 230 v or 400 v at up to 11 kw  the
on the car directly accepts  mennekes 
charging from public stations at up to 400v  and included adapters allow the car to charge from standard continental european outlets and
230 volt  blue 3-pin  or 400 volt  red 5-pin  outlets  depending on region  the addition of a second charger supports charging at up to 22kw  providing up to 70 miles  110km  of range per hour of charge  the tesla wall connector is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2016

suspension  
the model s has
suspension on all four wheels
front   virtual steer axis
and rear independent   as an extra-cost option  the car is available with  
  this is accomplished via adjustable bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver  the car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain  despite the low 6-inch
and rather long 116-inch wheelbase 
because  in the tesla  electronic systems can be upgraded by  over-the-air  download  rather than recall  the suspension system has been changed retroactively on several occasions  during the 2013  fire investigation  
asked tesla to disable the car s ability to lower itself at speed on the theory that a ground clearance below 6 inches might cause the batteries underneath the car to contact road debris  in september 2014  tesla upgraded the
for model s cars equipped with air suspension to remember locations that require higher clearance such as those with potholes and steep driveways  and automatically adjusts to avoid them

beginning in late september 2014  all new model s vehicles come equipped with a camera  supplied by   mounted at the top of the windshield  forward looking radar  supplied by   in the lower grill  and ultrasonic
sensors in the front and rear bumpers that provide a 360-degree buffer zone around the car  this equipment allows model s to detect road signs  lane markings  obstacles  and other vehicles  in addition to
and   a us 2,500  tech package  option will allow this system to enable semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities  all model s sold since october 2014 have the option to have autopilot  which allows limited   autopilot-enabled cars receive software updates for the autopilot software wirelessly  just as all other model s cars receive general software updates wirelessly 
some people agreed that tesla autopilot can reduce accidents due negligence and fatigue in long range drive use 
according to elon musk  the model s was designed to be a computer on wheels   we really designed the model s to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels  tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company  a huge part of what tesla is  is a silicon valley software company  we view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop   full autonomy is really a software limitation  the hardware exists to create full autonomy  so its really about developing advanced 
for the car to operate on 
tesla s autonomous driving features are ahead of production cars  and its autopilot can be classified as somewhere between levels 2 and 3 under the s
 nhtsa    at this level  the car can act autonomously but requires the full attention of the driver  who must be prepared to take control at a moment s notice  autopilot is suitable only on   and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself  in urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs  the system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists 
starting october 2016  all tesla cars are built with the necessary hardware to allow full self-driving capability at a safety level     the system will operate in  shadow mode   processing without taking action  and send data back to tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades  tesla motors says it expects to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017  after proper testing 
fatal accident  
the first known fatal accident involving a tesla model s when the car was in autopilot mode took place in
on 7 may 2016  the driver was killed in a crash with a large 18-wheel   by late june 2016 the u s 
 nhtsa  opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the   according to the nhtsa  preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway  and the car failed to apply the brakes  the car continued to travel after passing under the trucks trailer  the nhtsa s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash  which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 model s cars  on 8 july 2016  the nhtsa requested tesla motors to hand over to the agency detailed information about the design  operation and testing of its autopilot technology  the agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to autopilot since its introduction  and tesla s planned updates scheduled for the next four months 
according to tesla   neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky  so the brake was not applied   the car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer   with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the model s   tesla also stated that this was teslas first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles  208 million km  driven by its customers where autopilot was activated  according to tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles  150 million km  among all type of vehicles in the u s  some statisticians say that tesla s use of statistics is meaningless due to the relatively small total distance traveled by tesla cars and the different driving conditions of the two data sets being compared  it is estimated that billions of miles will need to be traveled before a statistically significant comparison can be made  researchers say that tesla and others need to release more data on the limitations and performance of automated driving systems if self-driving cars are to become safe and understood enough for mass market use

the battery and drive unit are covered for eight years or 125,000 miles  200,000km in metric countries  for the 60kwh base model  or eight years and unlimited distance for all 70 and 85kwh models  the unconditional battery warranty covers everything except deliberate damage  even including user error  however  loss of battery capacity over time or usage is not covered under warranty   
environmental footprint  
in february 2014  the automotive science group  asg  published the result of a study conducted to
of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in north america  the study ranked the model s as the best environmental performer in the 2014
category  based on the assessment of life-cycle environmental footprint  the study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the vehicle are more than offset with increased environmental performance during operation  for the assessment  the study used the average electricity mix of the u s  grid in 2014  the
had the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the north american market 
in 2015  the
found that in the us regions where the model s is popular  the 68  higher manufacturing emissions are offset within a few years of average driving  during their life-cycle  evs emit about half the amount of comparable fossil cars  according to an

main article 
in 2012  tesla began building a network of 480-volt
to facilitate long-distance travel  in june 2013 tesla announced that existing and future stations would become   with facilities to support under-two-minute battery pack swaps  as of early october 2014  115 stations were operating in the united states  71 in europe and 23 in asia  the tesla network is usable only by tesla vehicles  which are engineered for compatibility 
the first supercharger corridor opened in october 2012  with six stations placed along routes connecting san francisco    los angeles and   a second corridor opened in december 2012 connecting washington  d c   new york city  and   it includes three stations located in highway rest areas in
and  
the first tesla stations in europe opened in norway in august 2013  tesla next focused on germany and the netherlands  with plans to cover both countries by mid-2014  switzerland  belgium  austria  denmark and luxembourg were to be covered by the end of 2014  stations were to be within 200mi  320km  for about 90  of the population in france  england  wales and sweden by the end of 2014 
supercharger  
the supercharger is a proprietary dc rapid-charging station that provides up to 135kw of power  giving 85kwh vehicles an additional 180mi  290km  of range in about 1530 minutes  older 60kwh may have reduced charge rate  in the west coast corridor the superchargers s grid access is assisted by a
system  some including a battery of a few hundred kwh  provided by   eventually  all tesla stations will be assisted by solar power 
supercharging hardware is now a standard on all vehicles sold by tesla motors  the roadster is not compatible  in early november 2013  tesla reported that 90  of its customers had opted for supercharging capability  as of april 2016  there are over 620 open superchargers around the world  elon musk said at the unveiling of the model 3 that that number would be doubled by the end of 2017  tesla has received criticism about the length of time it has taken them to install chargers on high use corridors of the united states such as i-40 and i-80   
tesla built 120kw
stations to allow long distance travel in north america  europe  asia  and australia  a supercharger can add up to 125 miles  201km  of range in 20 minutes and a full charge in approximately one hour assuming a nearly empty 85 kwh battery 
supercharging hardware is included in the 85kwh  70kwh  and 60kwh battery packs  in both the 85kwh models and 70kwh models  the payment for the car includes supercharging by default  but in the 60kwh  supercharging was software-disabled and one must pay an extra fee to enable supercharging 
battery swapping  
tesla designed its model s to allow fast battery swapping  which also facilitates vehicle assembly  in june 2013  tesla announced their goal to deploy a
station in tesla stations  at a demonstration tesla showed a battery swap operation taking just over 90 seconds  about half the time it takes to refill an empty gas tank 
panoramic view of tesla supercharger rapid charging station in  
battery swapping was to be deployed along
to allow travel from san francisco to los angeles  these were to be followed by the washington  d c  to boston corridor  each swapping station costs us 500,000 and stocks about 50 batteries  the service would be offered for the price of about 15 us gallons  57l  12impgal  of gasoline at the current local rate  around us 60 to us 80 at june 2013 prices  owners can pick up their original battery pack fully charged on the return trip  which is included in the swap fee  tesla would also offer the option to keep the swapped battery for a fee or to receive the original pack from tesla for a fee  pricing has not been determined 
tesla s only battery swap station is located at harris ranch  california  and was available for pilot testing in late december 2014  as of 2015  tesla says they have hundreds of cars in the battery swap program  although few owners are interested in using the service  in june 2015  tesla said that it was unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added due to lack of demand for battery swaps costing around  60 when supercharging is included free with most models 
editions  
tesla allocated the first 1,000 units to its signature and signature performance limited edition configurations  equipped with the 85kwh battery pack  and priced in the u s  at us 95,400 and us 105,400 respectively  not including any applicable   as of july 2015  the base model s starts at us 75,000 with a 70kwh battery pack and goes up to us 105,000 for the performance model with the 85kwh pack before any government subsidies  tesla does not make a

tesla motors reported 520 reservations for the model s during the first week they were available and by december 2012  a total 15,000 net reservations  after deliveries and cancellations  had been received by year-end  the special edition model s signature model was sold out before deliveries began in june 2012  and according to tesla motors all models were sold out for that year shortly after  a car ordered in may 2012 would be delivered in early to mid-2013 
initially tesla expected to reach global sales of 35,000 units in 2014  but in november 2014 reduced its sales target to 33,000 units due to a deficit in production of 2,000 units during the third quarter of 2014  the company expected its annual production to increase by over 50  in 2014 to 35,000 units  and another increase of 50  in 2015  tesla motors set a target of between 50,000 and 52,000 deliveries for model s and
cars in 2015  and delivered 50,658 units  tesla plans to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new model s and model x vehicles in 2016 
2012
u s  deliveries began june 2012  deliveries of the 60kwh model were rescheduled from november 2012 to january february 2013  a total of 2,650 cars were delivered in north america in 2012 
2013
during the first six months of 2013  10,050 were delivered  the model s was released in europe in early august 2013  and the first deliveries took place in norway  switzerland and the netherlands  and by november 2013  the model s was on sale in 20 countries 
sales totaled about 22,477 units in north america and europe  surpassing tesla s annual sales target of 21,500 units  global cumulative sales passed the 25,000 unit milestone in december 2013  by the end of 2013  according to   norway and switzerland became the company s largest per capita sales markets

tesla motors sells its cars directly to consumers without creating a dealer network  as other manufacturers have done and as many states require by legislation  in support of its approach  the company has fought legal and legislative battles in ohio  new jersey  new york and other states  with law changes in recent years in new jersey  new york  maryland  ohio  and pennsylvania the tesla direct sales model is permitted in 22 states as of march 2015  as of may 2015 the sales procedure in other states such as texas is somewhat different with the tesla salesperson being prevented from discussing prices  the actual sale having to be made online and the sales tax having to be paid up front  delivery of a tesla car to a texas address is no different than in other states  consequently  while tesla showcases and sells its cars directly to the consumer in tesla stores abroad  it operates a mix of tesla stores and tesla galleries in the us

the first widely reported model s fire occurred several minutes after the vehicle hit metal debris on the
highway in
on october 1  2013  the driver  was able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system  bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury   he then contacted authorities and  while awaiting their arrival  smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle  the driver stated that he hit something while exiting the   tesla stated that the fire was caused by the  direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16
modules   and that by design  the modules were separated by firewalls  limiting the fire to  a small section in the front of the vehicle  
the module was evidently punctured by a  curved section  that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident  tesla stated that the debris punched a 3-inch  76mm  diameter hole through the  25-inch  6.4mm  armor plate under the vehicle  applying force of some 25   built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment  according to tesla  the firefighters followed standard procedure  using large amounts of water to extinguish the fire was correct  however  puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk  tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains  only about 10  of the energy contained in a gasoline tank   the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1  that of a conventional vehicle 
on october 24  2013  the u s 
 nhtsa  announced   after reviewing all available data  the national highway traffic safety administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a tesla model s was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards   but the following month  the nhtsa opened a preliminary evaluation to determine  the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 tesla model s vehicles   on march 28  2014  nhtsa closed its investigation  claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates  along with increased ground clearance   should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk  
subsequent fires  
on november 6  2013 another fire broke out after a model s struck a
on the roadway  causing damage beneath the vehicle  the incidents led tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed 
another fire incident took place in toronto  canada  in early february 2014  the model s was parked in a garage and was not charging when the fire started  the origin of the fire is undetermined  according to tesla  in this particular case  we don t yet know the precise cause  but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery  the charging system  the adapter or the electrical receptacle  as these components were untouched by the fire  
starting with vehicle bodies manufactured as of 6 march 2014  all units were outfitted with a triple underbody shield  existing cars were retrofitted upon request or as part of a normally scheduled service 
on 1 january 2016  a 2014 model s caught fire in norway while supercharging unsupervised  the vehicle was totally destroyed but nobody was injured  the fire was slow  and the owner had time to unplug the car and retrieve possessions  an investigation by the
indicated that the fire originated in the car  but was otherwise inconclusive  in march 2016  tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the vehicle s distribution box  but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause  tesla stated that the supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated  and a future model s software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected 
recalls  
on november 20  2015  tesla announced a voluntary worldwide recall of all of its 90,000 model s vehicles  in order to check for a possible defect in the cars  front seat belt assemblies  the problem was raised in early november by one customer in europe  tesla s resulting investigation was unable to identify a root cause for the failure  and the company decided to examine every single car  tesla reported that there have been no accidents or injuries related to the problem

consumer reports  2013 survey of owner satisfaction produced a score of 99 out of 100   the highest the magazine has seen in years   in 2014 the model s topped for the second year in a row consumer reports survey of owner satisfaction  this time the model s had a score of 98 out of 100 
consumer reports found the model s to be  best overall  for 2014 across all 10 categories of cars  light trucks and suvs  chosen from more than 260 vehicles the organization has recently tested  the magazine considers the model s a  technological tour de force  while pricey  is brimming with innovation   in 2015 they rated the model s at 103  breaking the scale

2013   also a unanimous decision and the first winner in the award s history to not be powered by an internal combustion engine 
2013 ecoenergy for vehicles awards in the full-size category
 s auto grand award winner best of what s new list 2012 
included the model s in its list of the top 10 cars that changed the world published in december 2014  and also named the electric sedan the most important car of the last 20 years 
best 25 inventions of the year 2012 award 
autos 2013 car of the year 
green car guide 2015  top spot  p85d   the model s also won the 2014 aaa green car guide 
distance records  
as of august 2015  the distance record is 452.8mi  728.7km  in a model s on a single charge  it was made by norwegian bjrn nyland and his friend  morgan trvolt on a flat stretch with low traffic around the supercharger in   denmark  they used
techniques such as front motor only  low speed  39km h  and no airconditioning  the previous record was 425.8 miles  685.3km   made overnight on february 14  2013 by bruno bowden  the first record of 423.5 miles  681.6km  was set during november 2012 by david and adam metcalf  these attempts were inspired by a blog written by elon musk about the planned range and efficiency of the tesla model s  offering a prize for anyone exceeding 400 miles  640km  on a single charge  where it was estimated the 85 kwh model could do it by driving at a constant 36mph  58km h  under ideal conditions 
controversies  
range limitation  
on february 8  2013 
published a review by john m  broder about a trip between washington  d c   and boston using tesla s supercharger network  at the time it included only two stations on the   broder made a variety of critical claims about the battery s performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations  the trip ended with the model s carried by a
to the   station 
tesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicle s charge levels and driving speed that contradicted broder s account on several factual details  tesla implied that broder s behavior forced the car to fail  broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with   in the midst of the controversy  a
reporter recreated broder s trip without exhausting the battery  however  two key differences distinguished the two journeys  the weather was about 10f  6c  warmer and cnn did the trip in one day  the times let the car sit overnight without being plugged in  a reporter from
also recreated the trip in one day without incidents  one week later  a group of tesla owners recreated broder s trip without problems  one owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two
updates 
on february 18  2013  new york times
margaret sullivan published an editorial stating that broder took  casual and imprecise notes  of his test drive and did not use good judgment  but she maintained that the article was done in good faith  she also claimed that broder s vehicle logs were  sometimes quite misleading  
in july and september 2014 tests performed by an independent german car magazine in cooperation with the tv  german association for technical inspection  and tesla owners seemed to reveal issues with the battery s performance  according to the magazine  tesla did not take up the invitation to repeat the test  and also seemed to refuse to offer vehicles for a second test  a test performed by another german publication      supported the findings 
nhtsa safest car  
on august 19  2013  based on nhtsa safety ratings  a tesla press release claimed that the model s had achieved the best safety rating of any car ever tested  tesla stated   nhtsa does not publish a star rating above 5  however safety levels better than 5 stars are captured in the overall vehicle safety score  vss  provided to manufacturers  where the model s achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars   however  a few days later nhtsa rebutted tesla s claim  explaining that the rating for the model s was equal to any other car receiving 5-stars  and claiming that the carmaker did not follow its advertising guidelines 
power dissipation when not in use  
older versions of the system software suffered from power drain issues when the car wasn t being used  with the batteries losing 4.5 kwh overnight  known commonly as  vampire drain    system software v5.8  v1.49.30   released december 12  2013  reduced overnight energy loss substantially  to 1.1kwh per night  or around 3 miles  in january 2014  bjrn nyland  a model s owner in norway  recorded a range loss of approximately 20  during a 27-day extended vacation  an indicated range loss of 63 miles  101km   or 2.3 miles  3.7km  per day  while stored in frigid temperatures without any charging cable attached 
consumer reports  recommendation  
in october 2015  two months after naming the tesla  the best car ever tested   consumer reports declined to give the tesla model s a  recommended  designation  citing too many complaints from owners  complaints ranged from minor  such as misaligned doors and squeaky body  to severe - things like total drive train replacement and inoperable door handles  tesla s shares dropped 15   both because of the magazine s cut and because of concerns over the tesla model x luxury suv  similarly  edmunds com found quality and safety issues in their long-term road test and  amassed quite the repair rsum during the last 17 months   both edmunds and consumer reports reported issues  including the vehicle stalling while driving 
in their 2016 annual auto reliability survey  consumer reports improved the model s rating to average reliability  while reporting that the model x has had significant malfunction issues  the magazine also raised  serious concerns about how some automakers  including tesla  have designed  deployed  and marketed semi-autonomous technology  
power discrepancy  
the p85d  insane  was widely reported to have 691 horsepower  but some owners reported 20  less power on
in various circumstances 
manufacturers are required by eu law to display power  at full setting of the power controller   from an external dc source when performing laboratory vehicle approval   but not necessarily to show power limited by battery  other equipment must be removed  or their power added to the measurement  actual power available depends on circumstances  as it does for piston cars which until 1972 could be 2530  less than given 
as of november 2015  tesla website shows battery-limited combined 463hp for p85d  532hp for  ludicrous   
autonomy limitations  
the autonomy features of the model s  including autosteer and   have limitations that have led to collisions when the driver becomes inattentive  tesla warns in the owners manual that drivers always must be aware of road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision  as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles  bicycles  and pedestrians  however  critics such as scientist
have accused tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security 
electrical consumption of tesla model s  
in early march 2016  a report by
revealed that test performed by vicom  ltd on behalf of singapore s land transport authority had found a 2014 tesla model s to be consuming 444wh km  0.715kwh mi   which was greater than the 236wh km  0.38kwh mi  reported by the u s environmental protection agency  epa  and the 181wh km  0.291kwh mi  reported by tesla  as a result  a carbon surcharge of s 15,000  us 10,900  was imposed on the model s  making singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car  the land transport authority justified this by stating that it had to  account for co2 emissions during the electricity generation process  and therefore  a grid emission factor of 0.5g watt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption   however tesla motors countered that when the energy used to extract  refine  and distribute gasoline was taken into account  the model s produces approximately one-third the co2 of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle 
later that month  the land transport authority released a statement stating that they and the vicom emission test laboratory will be working with tesla engineers to determine if there was a flaw in the test  and a tesla statement indicated that the discussions were  positive  and that they were confident of a quick resolution
