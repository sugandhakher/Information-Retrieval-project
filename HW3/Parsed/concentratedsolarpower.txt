concentrated solar power  also called concentrating solar power  concentrated solar thermal  and csp  systems generate
by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight  or   onto a small area 
is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat  which drives a
 usually a   connected to an electrical
or powers a
reaction  experimental as of 2013  
csp is being widely commercialized and the csp market saw about 740
 mw  of generating capacity added between 2007 and the end of 2010  more than half of this  about 478mw  was installed during 2010  bringing the global total to 1095mw  spain added 400mw in 2010  taking the global lead with a total of 632mw  while the us ended the year with 509mw after adding 78mw  including two fossilcsp hybrid plants  the middle east is also ramping up their plans to install csp based projects and as a part of that plan 
which was the largest csp project in the world has been installed in abu dhabi  by   the largest csp project in the world until january 2016 is
in morocco and global operational power stands at 4,705mw 
there is considerable academic and commercial interest internationally in a new form of csp  called stem  for off-grid applications to produce 24-hour industrial scale power for mining sites and remote communities in   other parts of europe  australia  asia 
and latin america  stem uses fluidized
as a thermal storage and
medium for csp systems  it has been developed by salerno-based magaldi industries  the first commercial application of stem was scheduled to take place in sicily from 2015 
csp growth is expected to continue at a fast pace  as of january 2014  spain had a total capacity of 2,300mw making this country the world leader in csp  united states follows with 1,740mw  interest is also notable in north africa and the middle east  as well as india and china  in italy  a handful of companies are trying to get authorization for 14 plants  totalling 392mw  despite a strong local and political opposition  the global market has been dominated by parabolic-trough plants  which account for 90  of csp plants 
csp is not to be confused with
 cpv   in cpv  the concentrated sunlight is converted directly to electricity via the  
in california is running 69 percent below advertised power output  and one spanish company    that commercialized csp both in the us and abroad  is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy  csp technologies currently cannot compete on price with photovoltaics  solar panels   which have experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices of the panels  another drawback of ivanpah is that it lacks thermal energy storage  one of the big advantages that csp has over pv and most other renewables  which require either large scale energy storage systems like pumped hydro or fast acting natural gas power plants to be there as backup for those times when they are not producing much energy

history  
a legend has it that
used a  burning glass  to concentrate sunlight on the invading roman fleet and repel them from   in 1973 a greek scientist  dr  ioannis sakkas  curious about whether archimedes could really have destroyed the roman fleet in 212 bc  lined up nearly 60 greek sailors  each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the sun s rays and direct them at a tar-covered plywood silhouette 160 feet away  the ship caught fire after a few minutes  however  historians continue to doubt the archimedes story 
in 1866 
used a parabolic trough to produc steam for the first solar steam engine  the first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the italian alessandro battaglia in genoa  italy  in 1886  over the following years  invntors such as
and
developed concentrating solar-powered dvices for irrigation  refrigration  and locomtion  in 1913 shuman finished a 55hp parabolic
station in maadi  egypt for irrigation  the first solar-power system using a mirror dish was built by   who was already well known for his research on liquid-fueled rockets and wrote an article in 1929 in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed 
professor giovanni francia  19111980  designed and built the first concentrated-solar plant  which entered into operation in sant ilario  near genoa  italy in 1968  this plant had the architecture of today s concentrated-solar plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors  the plant was able to produce 1mw with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500c  the 10mw
power tower was developed in southern california in 1981  but the parabolic-trough technology of the nearby
 segs   begun in 1984  was more workable  the 354mw segs is still the largest solar power plant in the world  and will remain so until the 390mw ivanpah power tower project reaches full power 
current technology  
csp is used to produce electricity  sometimes called solar thermoelectricity  usually generated through    concentrated-solar technology systems use
or
with
systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area  the concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional
 solar thermoelectricity   the solar concentrators used in csp systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling  such as in solar air-conditioning 
concentrating technologies exist in five common forms  namely   enclosed trough      and   although simple  these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration  for example  the parabolic-trough concentration gives about  of the theoretical maximum for the design   that is  for the same overall tolerances for the system  approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on  
different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies  due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light  new innovations in csp technology are leading systems to become more and more cost-effective 
parabolic trough  
parabolic trough at a plant near harper lake  california
main article 
a parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector s focal line  the receiver is a tube positioned directly above the middle of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid  the reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis  a
 e g    is heated to 150350c  300660f  as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system  trough systems are the most developed csp technology  the
 segs  plants in california  the world s first commercial parabolic trough plants  acciona s
near   and   europe s first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative  along with  s ssps-dcs test facilities in  
enclosed trough  
the design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse  the glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system  lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires  a
positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight  the mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes  also suspended from the glasshouse structure  water is carried throughout the length of the pipe  which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied  sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors 
inside an enclosed trough system
  the company that created the enclosed trough design  states its technology can produce heat for
 eor  for about  5 per million british thermal units in sunny regions  compared to between  10 and  12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies 
solar power tower  
main article 
the
in andaluca  spain  concentrates sunlight from a field of
onto a central  
a solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors    that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower  the receiver contains a fluid deposit  which can consist of   the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 5001000c  7731,273k  9321,832f   and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system  an advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower  power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems  but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability  the
in   california and the cesa-1 in
almeria  spain  are the most representative demonstration plants  the
 ps10  in   spain  is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world  the 377mw   located in the   is the largest csp facility in the world  and uses three power towers  the
located in   is an experimental solar thermal test facility with a heliostat field capable of producing 6mw 
fresnel reflectors  
main article 
fresnel reflectors are made of many thin  flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped  flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space as a parabolic reflector  thus capturing more of the available sunlight  and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors  fresnel reflectors can be used in various size csps 
dish stirling  
main article 
a dish stirling or dish engine system consists of a stand-alone
that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflector s focal point  the reflector tracks the sun along two axes  the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250700c  4801,300f  and then used by a
to generate power  parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency  between 31  and 32    and their modular nature provides scalability  the
 ses  
 uss  and
dishes at   and  s
in   australia are representative of this technology  a world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at 31.25  by ses dishes at the
 nsttf  in new mexico on january 31  2008  a cold  bright day  according to its developer    a swedish firm  in 2015 its dish sterling system being tested in the
in south africa showed 34  efficiency  the ses installation in maricopa  phoenix was the largest stirling dish power installation in the world until it was sold to   subsequently  larger parts of the installation have been moved to china as part of the huge energy demand 
solar thermal enhanced oil recovery  
main article 
heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump  solar power tower and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no electricity is produced  solar thermal enhanced oil recovery can extend the life of oilfields with very thick oil which would not otherwise be economical to pump

global status report  september 2015 133
the commercial deployment of csp plants started by 1984 in the us with the
plants  the last segs plant was completed in 1990  from 1991 to 2005 no csp plants were built anywhere in the world  global installed csp-capacity has increased nearly tenfold since 2004 and grew at an average of 50 percent per year during the last five years  51 in 2013  worldwide installed capacity increased by 36 percent or nearly 0.9
 gw  to more than 3.4gw 
and the
remained the global leaders  while the number of countries with installed csp were growing  there is a notable trend towards developing countries and regions with high solar radiation 
csp is also increasingly competing with the cheaper
solar power and with
 cpv   a fast-growing technology that just like csp is suited best for regions of high solar insolation  in addition  a novel solar cpv csp hybrid system has been proposed recently

theoretical efficiencies aside  real-world experience of csp reveals a 25-60 percent shortfall in projected production  a pilot 5 megawatt csp power tower    was converted to a 10 megawatt csp power tower    decommissioned in 1999  due to the success of solar two  a commercial power plant  called   was built in spain  renamed gemasolar thermosolar plant  gemasolar brilliant results have paved the way for the   ivanpah difficulties arise also from not having considered the lessons about the benefits of thermal storage 
in arizona is 25 percent below projected numbers  ivanpah in california  is 40 percent below projected numbers  a slightly bigger   like the 290mw
peaked at most to 741gwh in 2014  comparing with the 280mw solana growing 719gwh  lower insolation related to a solar minimum is part of the problem  but there is clearly a technical issue with rating these systems or simply a commercial overstatement  indeed  an other operator  that of the 280mw   projected only 580gwh production and instead made 621gwh in 2015  csp once thought to be economically superior to photovoltaics  in 2015 it has proven not to be the case  recent pv commercial power is selling for  recent csp contracts 
costs  
as of 9 september 2009  the cost of building a csp station was typically about us 2.50 to  4 per watt  while the fuel  the sun s radiation  is free  thus a 250mw csp station would have cost  6001000 million to build  that works out to  0.12 to 0.18 usd kwh  new csp stations may be economically competitive with fossil fuels  nathaniel bullard  a solar analyst at bloomberg new energy finance  has calculated that the cost of electricity at the   a project under construction in southern california  will be lower than that from photovoltaic power and about the same as that from natural gas  however  in november 2011  google announced that they would not invest further in csp projects due to the rapid price decline of   google invested us 168 million on brightsource 
has published on june 2012 a series of studies titled   renewable energy cost analysis   the csp study shows the cost of both building and operation of csp plants  costs are expected to decrease  but there are insufficient installations to clearly establish the learning curve  as of march 2012  there were 1.9gw of csp installed  with 1.8gw of that being parabolic trough 
incentives  
spain  
solar-thermal electricity generation is eligible for feed-in tariff payments  art  2 rd 661/2007   if the system capacity does not exceed the following limits  systems registered in the register of systems prior to 29 september 2008  500mw for solar-thermal systems  systems registered after 29 september 2008  pv only   the capacity limits for the different system types are re-defined during the review of the application conditions every quarter  art  5 rd 1578/2008  annex iii rd 1578/2008   prior to the end of an application period  the market caps specified for each system type are published on the website of the ministry of industry  tourism and trade  art  5 rd 1578/2008  
since 27 january 2012  spain has halted acceptance of new projects for the feed-in-tariff  projects currently accepted are not affected  except that a 6  tax on feed-in-tariffs has been adopted  effectively reducing the feed-in-tariff 
australia

at the federal level  under the large-scale renewable energy target  lret   in operation under the renewable energy electricity act 2000  large scale solar thermal electricity generation from accredited ret power stations may be entitled to create large-scale generation certificates  lgcs   these certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities  usually electricity retailers  to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme  however  as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation  it tends to favour more established re technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation  such as large scale onshore wind  rather than solar thermal and csp  at state level  renewable energy feed-in laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kwp  and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar pv  photovoltaic  generation  this means that larger scale csp projects would not be eligible for payment for feed-in incentives in many of the state and territory jurisdictions 
future  
a study done by   the european solar thermal electricity association  and the  s
group investigated the potential and future of concentrated solar power  the study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25  of the world s energy needs by 2050  the increase in investment would be from 2 billion euros worldwide to 92.5 billion euros in that time period  spain is the leader in concentrated solar power technology  with more than 50 government-approved projects in the works  also  it exports its technology  further increasing the technology s stake in energy worldwide  because the technology works best with areas of high
 solar radiation   experts predict the biggest growth in places like africa  mexico  and the southwest united states  it indicates that the thermal storage systems based in
           will make the csp plants more and more profitable  the study examined three different outcomes for this technology  no increases in csp technology  investment continuing as it has been in spain and the us  and finally the true potential of csp without any barriers on its growth  the findings of the third part are shown in the table below

on 9september 2009  7 years ago 2009-09-09   bill weihl   s green-energy spokesperson said that the firm was conducting research on the heliostat mirrors and gas turbine technology  which he expects will drop the cost of solar thermal electric power to less than  0.05 kwh in 2 or 3 years 
in 2009  scientists at the
 nrel  and
teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30  less expensive than today s best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a
polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors  but at much lower cost and weight  it also is much easier to deploy and install  the glossy film uses several layers of polymers  with an inner layer of pure silver

recent experience with csp technology in 2014 - 2015 at solana in arizona  and ivanpah in nevada indicate large production shortfalls in electricity generation between 25 and 40 percent  producers blame clouds and stormy weather  but critics seem to think there are technological issues  these problems are causing utilities to pay inflated prices for wholesale electricity  and threaten the long-term viability of the technology  as photovoltaic costs continue to plummet  many think csp has a limited future in utility-scale electricity production  on the other side  part of photovoltaic costs drop is the result of the fossil fuel cost reductions  which still powers most of pv production  instead csp would be unaffected when fossil prices return to higher quotes

it has been noted that insects can be attracted to the bright light caused by concentrated solar technology  and as a result birds that hunt them can be killed  burned  if the birds fly near the point where light is being focused onto  this can also affect raptors who hunt the birds  federal wildlife officials have begun calling these power towers  mega traps  for wildlife 
however  the story about the
was exaggerated  numbering the deaths in many tens of thousands  spreading alarm about concentrated solar power  csp  plants  which was not grounded in facts  but on one opponent s speculation  according to rigorous reporting  in over six months  actually only 133 singed birds were counted  by focusing no more than 4 mirrors on any one place in the air during standby  at   in 3 months  the death rate dropped to zero fatalities
