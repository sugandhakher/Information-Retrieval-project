history  
are believed to have used biochar to enhance soil productivity  they produced it by
agricultural waste  i e   covering burning biomass with soil  in pits or trenches  european settlers called it   following observations and experiments  a research team working in
hypothesized that the amazonian
pontoscolex corethrurus was the main agent of fine powdering and incorporation of charcoal debris to the mineral soil 
the term biochar was coined by peter read to describe charcoal used as a soil improvement 
production  
biochar is a high-carbon  fine-grained residue that today is produced through modern
processes  which is the direct
of biomass in the absence of   which prevents   to obtain an array of solid  biochar   liquid     and gas    products  the specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process conditions  such as temperature  and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar  temperatures of 400500c  752932f  produce more   while temperatures above 700c  1,292f  favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components  pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures  typically requiring seconds instead of hours  high temperature pyrolysis is also known as   and produces primarily   typical yields are 60    20  biochar  and 20  syngas  by comparison  slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char   50    once initialized  both processes produce net energy  for typical inputs  the energy required to run a fast pyrolyzer is approximately 15  of the energy that it outputs  modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 39 times the amount of energy required to run 
the amazonian pit trench method harvests neither bio-oil nor syngas  and releases a large amount of co2    and other
 ghg s  and potentially    into the air  commercial-scale systems process agricultural waste  paper byproducts  and even municipal waste and typically eliminate these side effects by capturing and using the liquid and gas products 
centralized  decentralized  and mobile systems  
in a centralized system  all biomass in a region is brought to a central plant for processing  alternatively  each farmer or group of farmers can operate a lower-tech   finally  a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer can move from place to place to pyrolyze biomass  vehicle power comes from the
stream  while the biochar remains on the farm  the
is sent to a refinery or storage site  factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts  the amount of material to be processed  and the ability to feed directly into the power grid 
for crops that are not exclusively for biochar production  the residue-to-product ratio  rpr  and the collection factor  cf  the percent of the residue not used for other things  measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product  for instance 
harvests approximately 460 million tons  mt  of
annually  with an rpr of 0.30  and a cf of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops  which normally are burned in the field  this translates into approximately 100 mt of residue annually  which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives  adding in the
 sugarcane waste   rpr 0.29 cf 1.0   which is otherwise burned  inefficiently  in boilers  raises the total to 230 mt of pyrolysis feedstock  some plant residue  however  must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers 
pyrolysis technologies for processing loose and leafy biomass produce both biochar and syngas 
thermo-catalytic depolymerization  
alternatively   thermo-catalytic depolymerization   which utilizes   has recently been used to efficiently convert organic matter to biochar on an industrial scale  producing  50  char

the burning and natural decomposition of biomass and in particular agricultural waste adds large amounts of co
2 to the atmosphere  biochar that is stable  fixed  and  recalcitrant  carbon can store large amounts of greenhouse gases in the ground for centuries  potentially reducing or stalling the growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels  at the same time its presence in the earth can improve water quality  increase soil fertility  raise agricultural productivity  and reduce pressure on  
biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years  like   such a carbon-negative technology would lead to a net withdrawal of co2 from the atmosphere  while producing and consuming energy  this technique is advocated by prominent scientists such as   head of the   and   creator of the   for
by  
researchers have estimated that sustainable use of biocharring could reduce the global net emissions of carbon dioxide  co
2   methane  and nitrous oxide by up to 1.8pg
 co
2-ce  per year  12  of current anthropogenic co
2-ce emissions  1pg 1gt   and total net emissions over the course of the next century by 130pg co
2-ce  without endangering food security  habitat  or soil conservation 
soil amendment  
biochar is recognised as offering a number of benefits for soil health  many benefits are related to the extremely porous nature of biochar  this structure is found to be very effective at retaining both water and water-soluble nutrients  soil biologist
indicates the extreme suitability of biochar as a habitat for many beneficial soil   she points out that when pre charged with these beneficial organisms biochar becomes an extremely effective soil amendment promoting good soil  and in turn plant  health 
biochar has also been shown to reduce leaching of
through sandy soils depending on application rate  feedstock  pyrolysis temperature  soil moisture content  soil texture  and surface properties of the bacteria 
for plants that require high
and elevated   biochar can be used as a
to improve yield 
biochar can improve water quality  reduce soil emissions of   reduce   reduce   and reduce
and
requirements  biochar was also found under certain circumstances to induce plant systemic responses to foliar fungal diseases and to improve plant responses to diseases caused by soilborne pathogens 
the various impacts of biochar can be dependent on the properties of the biochar  as well as the amount applied  and there is still a lack of knowledge about the important mechanisms and properties  biochar impact may depend on regional conditions including soil type  soil condition  depleted or healthy   temperature  and humidity  modest additions of biochar to soil reduce
n
2o emissions by up to 80  and eliminate
emissions  which are both more potent greenhouse gases than co2 
studies have reported positive effects from biochar on crop production in degraded and nutrientpoor soils  biochar can be designed with specific qualities to target distinct properties of soils  biochar reduces leaching of critical nutrients  creates a higher crop uptake of nutrients  and provides greater soil availability of nutrients  at 10  levels biochar reduced contaminant levels in plants by up to 80   while reducing total
and ddx content in the plants by 68 and 79   respectively  on the other hand  because of its high adsorption capacity  biochar may reduce the efficacy of soil applied pesticides that are needed for weed and pest control  high-surface-area biochars may be particularly problematic in this regard  more research into the long-term effects of biochar addition to soil is needed 
slash-and-char  
switching from
to
farming techniques in brazil can decrease both deforestation of the
and carbon dioxide emission  as well as increase crop yields  slash-and-burn leaves only 3  of the carbon from the organic material in the soil 
slash-and-char can keep up to 50  of the carbon in a highly stable form  returning the biochar into the soil rather than removing it all for energy production reduces the need for nitrogen fertilizers  thereby reducing cost and emissions from fertilizer production and transport  additionally  by improving the soil s ability to be tilled  fertility  and productivity  biocharenhanced soils can indefinitely sustain agricultural production  whereas non-enriched soils quickly become depleted of nutrients  forcing farmers to abandon the fields  producing a continuous slash and burn cycle and the continued loss of   using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for
does  additionally  the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer 
water retention  
biochar is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water  this is possible because of its porous structure and high surface area  as a result  nutrients  phosphorus  and agrochemicals are retained for the plants benefit  plants therefore  are healthier and fertilizers leach less into surface or groundwater 
energy production  bio-oil and syngas  
main article 
mobile pyrolysis units can be used to lower the costs of transportation of the biomass if the biochar is returned to the soil and the syngas stream is used to power the process  bio-oil contains organic acids that are corrosive to steel containers  has a high water vapor content that is detrimental to ignition  and  unless carefully cleaned  contains some biochar particles which can block injectors 
if biochar is used for the production of energy rather than as a soil amendment  it can be directly substituted for any application that uses coal  pyrolysis also may be the most cost-effective way of
from biomaterial 
direct and indirect benefits  
the pyrolysis of forest- or agriculture-derived biomass residue generates a biofuel without competition with crop production 
biochar is a pyrolysis byproduct that may be ploughed into soils in crop fields to enhance their fertility and stability  and for medium- to long-term carbon sequestration in these soils 
biochar enhances the natural process  the biosphere captures co
2  especially through plant production  but only a small portion is stably sequestered for a relatively long time  soil  wood  etc   
biomass production to obtain biofuels and biochar for carbon sequestration in the soil is a carbon-negative process  i e  more co
2 is removed from the atmosphere than released  thus enabling long-term sequestration 
research  
intensive research into manifold aspects involving the pyrolysis biochar platform is underway around the world  from 2005 to 2012  there were 1,038 articles that included the word biochar or bio-char in the topic that had been indexed in the isi web of science  further research is in progress by such diverse institutions around the world as   the   which has a dedicated research unit   and the   where a network of researchers involved in biochar research    was established as early as 2009 
students at
in new jersey are developing
that use electrodes made of biochar  a process developed by
researchers that removes
from water  also yields
usable as fuel and phosphate-laden carbon suitable for enriching soil 
emerging commercial sector  
calculations suggest that emissions reductions can be 12 to 84  greater if biochar is put back into the soil instead of being burned to offset fossil-fuel use  thus biochar sequestration offers the chance to turn bioenergy into a carbon-negative industry 
johannes lehmann  of cornell university  estimates that pyrolysis can be cost-effective for a combination of sequestration and energy production when the cost of a co
2 ton reaches  37  as of mid-february 2010 
at  16.82 ton on the
 ecx   so using pyrolysis for bioenergy production may be feasible even if it is more expensive than fossil fuel 
current biochar projects make no significant impact on the overall global carbon budget  although expansion of this technique has been advocated as a
approach  in may 2009  the biochar fund received a grant from the congo basin forest fund for a project in
to simultaneously slow down   increase the
of rural communities  provide
and sequester carbon   
application rates of 2.520 tonnes per hectare  1.08.1t acre  appear to be required to produce significant improvements in plant yields  biochar costs in developed countries vary from  3007000 tonne  generally too high for the farmer horticulturalist and prohibitive for low-input field crops  in developing countries  constraints on agricultural biochar relate more to biomass availability and production time  an alternative is to use small amounts of biochar in lower cost biochar-fertilizer complexes 
various companies in     and
sell biochar or biochar production units    in sweden the  stockholm solution  is an urban tree planting system that uses 30  biochar to support healthy growth of the urban forest  the qatar aspire park now uses biochar to help trees cope with the intense heat of their summers 
at the 2009 international biochar conference  a mobile pyrolysis unit with a specified intake of 1,000 pounds  450kg  was introduced for agricultural applications  the unit had a length of 12 feet and height of 7 feet  3.6 m by 2.1m  
a production unit in
by
opened in august 2009 after testing and an initial run  was later shut down as part of a
investigation
