the energy efficiency in europe study is part of the   it aims to monitor
progress and -reduction for the eu-27 countries and norway and croatia  understand the
trends for european countries  compare the countries in their relative  energy efficiency performance  as well as to benchmark values  measuring the contribution of innovative energy efficiency and renewables technologies to the lisbon targets to make europe more competitive and analyse and evaluate the performance of energy efficiency policies in the different eu member states and at eu level 
the
is a program coordinated by
and supported under the
of the  
energy efficiency is at the heart of the eus europe 2020 strategy for smart  sustainable and inclusive growth and of the transition to a
economy  according to eu commission the eu needs to act now  2011  to get on track to achieve its target while the eu is on course to achieve only half of the 20  objective  the combined effects of full implementation of the measures will generate financial savings of up to 1000 per household annually  improve europes industrial competitiveness  create up to 2 million jobs  and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 740 million tons

national energy efficiency action plans  
the national energy efficiency action plan plans offer an opportunity to compare the national energy efficiency measures in the european countries and review the actual national achievements compared to the targets  the first energy efficiency action plans neeap 20082010 were delivered in 2007  the second plans should cover the plans from 2011 forward 
neeap 20082010  
the action plan reports state the status in 20002005 and give the national policies and measures to energy savings by the national governments by sectors by 2016 and 2020 
the british plan sets a target that all new buildings will be zero-carbon from 2011 in wales and make all homes in england zero carbon by 2016 
according to the german plan energy efficiency constitutes a key competitive factor  greater security of supply of the exhaustible energy sources and the most effective means  from the point of view of costs  of reducing greenhouse gas emissions  the german target by 2020 is energy productivity double compared with 1990

background  
the  energy efficiency in europe  study gathers representatives  such as energy agencies  from the 28 eu member states plus norway and it aims at monitoring energy efficiency trends and policy measures in europe  the
are managed by   which updates the odyssee database twice by year  odysse measures the energy efficiency progress by main sector  industry  transport  households  and for the whole economy  all final consumers   mure is a database on policy measures  this project is part of the activity of the

energy efficiency in europe  highlights and figures by sector  
energy efficiency in the eu-27 improved by about 13  between 1996 and 2007  corresponding to 160 mtoe energy savings in 2007 
industry  
energy efficiency improved by about 2.1  year since 1990  each branches  except textile contributed to decrease the overall industrial efficiency index  since 1998  structural changes towards less energy-intensive branches now strengthen the influence of efficiency improvements on actual energy intensity in industry  however the impact of these structural changes is limited  they explain about 13  of the reduction in the industrial intensity since 1998  the situation is meanwhile different in countries  structural changes explain a high share of the reduction in 5 countries  hungary  czech republic  romania  sweden  ireland 
households  
in   energy efficiency improved by 1.1  year since 1990  space heating and large appliances experienced the greatest energy efficiency improvement  since 1990  close to 1.5  year each 
transport  
energy efficiency improved by 0,8   year since 1990   the specific consumption of cars in liters 100km is regularly decreasing  -0.9  year since 1990   with a more rapidly improvements for new cars since 1995  -1.6  year   however  part of this gain is offset by a shift to larger cars  for road goods transport  the energy consumption per ton-km has decreased regularly since 1993 because of a better management  increase in ton-km veh except from 1998 to 2002 
energy efficiency indicators  objectives and methodology  
according to   energy efficiency indicators can be used to make several types of analysis 
monitor the targets set at the national and international levels in energy efficiency and co2 abatement programmes 
evaluate of the energy efficiency policy and programmes  ministries  energy agencies or organisations in charge of the implementation of energy efficiency programmes need to provide regular evaluations to justify their action and the large amounts of public money that have been spent to support these programmes or to operate the energy efficiency agencies  in january 2013  the
declare that reducing the primary energy consumption by 20  will be possible only by strengthening these evaluations 
plan future actions  including r d programmes 
feed the energy demand forecasting models and improving the quality of forecasts  technico-economic models  that are characterised by a high level of desegregation  end-uses  make use of energy efficiency indicators to account for future changes in energy efficiency 
and finally  make cross-country comparisons in a harmonized way 
the energy intensity indicator is the most often used indicator to measure the energy efficiency  it is calculated per unit of
for the overall indicator and transports or value added for services and agriculture or private consumption for households  however  the odex index represents a better proxy for assessing energy efficiency trends at an aggregate level  e g  overall economy  industry  households  transport  services  than the traditional energy intensities  as they are cleaned from structural changes and from other factors not related to energy efficiency  more appliances  more cars     
the odex index is used in the odyssee-mure project to measure the progress of energy efficiency by main sector  industry  transport  households  and for the whole economy  all final consumers   for each sector  the index is calculated as a weighted average of sub-sectoral indices of energy efficiency progress  sub-sectors being industrial or service sector branches or end-uses for households or transport modes 
the sub-sectoral indices are calculated from variations of unit
indicators  measured in physical units and selected so as to provide the best proxy of energy efficiency progress  from a policy evaluation viewpoint  the fact that indices are used enables to combine different units for a given sector  for instance for households kwh appliance  koe m2  tep dwelling
the weight used to get the weighted aggregate is the share of each sub- sector in the total energy consumption of the subsectors considered in the calculation 
a value of odex equal to 90 means a 10  energy efficiency gain
