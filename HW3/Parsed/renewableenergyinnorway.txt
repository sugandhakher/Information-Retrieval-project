of pure electric vehicles achieved 2  of all passenger cars registered in norway  the segment s penetration passed 3  in december 2015  with about 90,000 pure electric vehicles registered by mid-september 2016  the all-electric segment achieved a market penetration of 3.5  of all light-duty vehicles on norway s roads

the stock of light-duty
registered in norway passed the 100,000 unit milestone in april 2016  making the country the fourth largest plug-in market in the world after the u s   china and japan  as of april 2016  the norwegian fleet of plug-in electric vehicles consist of about 81,500
passenger and light-duty vehicles  almost 17,100   and over 2,000 all-electric commercial vans  the total stock includes almost 12,000 used imported electric cars 
in february 2016  the government opened for public discussion until 1 july 2016 the proposed national transport plan 2018-2029  ntp   the plan explains that the transportation sector accounts for emissions of about 16.5 million
of co2  which is about one third of the total
produced domestically in norway  and road traffic  including both private cars and heavy vehicles  account for about 10 million tons of co2  the ntp set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars  trucks  ships  aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030 
in order to achieve this objective  among others  the ntp sets the goal that all new cars  buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 should be   this is  all-electric and   by 2030  heavy-duty vans  75  of new long-distance buses  and 50  of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles  also  by 2030  40  of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships  the proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over  all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids  and wherever possible  biofuels must be used  also  government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels  low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels  the plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles  but also for the reduction of the existing incentives  and proposes to invest more in public transport  walking and cycling
