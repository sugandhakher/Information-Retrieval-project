the energy modeling forum  emf  is a structured forum for discussing important issues in energy and the environment  the emf was established in 1976 at   the emf works through a series of ad hoc working groups  each focussing on a particular corporate or policy decision  the emf provides a non-partisan platform that ensures objective consideration of opposing views  participation is by invitation

ethos  
the emf was convened in 1976 over concerns that the insights that large-scale
could provide
were being overshadowed by the  plethora of detailed quantitative results  being disseminated and discussed  449 as a result  the emf sought to bring energy modelers together to provide a proper context for their work  indeed  the emf was  formed to foster better communication between the builders and users of energy models in energy planning and policy analysis   449 the emf periodically establishes ad hoc working groups to conduct studies on selected energy topics  a working group then identifies relevant existing models and sets a series of tests to illuminate the basic structure and behavior of each model  results are compared and the strengths and weaknesses of each model is documented in a  as of 1982  freely available report 
list of emf projects  
reports for most of the completed projects are available from the emf website  reports since 2006 have sometimes been published exclusively in special editions of  paywalled  academic journals instead
