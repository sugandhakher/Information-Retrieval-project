plants in the grass family  
are the largest members of the grass family  in bamboo  the internodal regions of the
are usually hollow and the
in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement  the
is also absent  the absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of   including the
and large bamboos  to be columnar rather than tapering 
bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world  due to a unique -dependent system  certain species of bamboo can grow 91cm  3ft  within a 24-hour period  at a rate of almost 4cm  1.5in  an hour  a growth around 1mm every 90 seconds  or one inch every 40 minutes   bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in south asia 
and east asia  being used for   as a food source  and as a versatile raw product  bamboo has a higher specific
than wood  brick  or concrete and a specific
that rivals steel

distribution  
worldwide distribution of bamboos
most bamboo are native to warm and moist tropical and warm temperate climates  however  many species are found in diverse climates  from hot tropical regions to cool mountainous regions and highland cloud forests  in the asia-pacific region they occur across east asia  from 50n latitude in
south to northern australia  and west to india and the   china  japan  korea  india  and australia  all have several endemic populations 
they also occur in small numbers in   confined to tropical areas  from southern senegal in the north to southern mozambique and madagascar in the south  in the americas bamboo has a native range from 47 s in southern
and the beech forests of central   through the south american tropical rainforests  to the
in ecuador near 14,000 feet  bamboo is also native through
and   northward into the  
canada  russia  and continental europe is not known to have any native species of bamboo 
recently  some attempts have been made to grow bamboo on a commercial basis in the
of east-central africa  especially in rwanda  in the united states  several companies are growing  harvesting  and distributing species such as

bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants on earth  with reported growth rates up to 91cm  36in  in 24 hours  however  the growth rate is dependent on local soil and climatic conditions  as well as species  and a more typical growth rate for many commonly cultivated bamboos in temperate climates is in the range of 310cm  1.23.9in  per day during the growing period  primarily growing in regions of warmer climates during the late   vast fields existed in what is now asia  some of the largest timber bamboo can grow over 30m  98ft  tall  and be as large as 2530cm  9.811.8in  in diameter  however  the size range for mature bamboo is species-dependent  with the smallest bamboos reaching only several inches high at maturity  a typical height range that would cover many of the common bamboos grown in the united states is 4.612m  1539ft   depending on species 
of china  known as the  town of bamboo   provides the optimal climate and soil conditions to grow  harvest  and process some of the most valued bamboo poles available worldwide 
unlike all trees  individual bamboo culms emerge from the ground at their full diameter and grow to their full height in a single
of three to four months  during this time  each new shoot grows vertically into a culm with no branching out until the majority of the mature height is reached  then  the branches extend from the nodes and leafing out occurs  in the next year  the pulpy wall of each culm slowly hardens  during the third year  the culm hardens further  the shoot is now a fully mature culm  over the next 25 years  depending on species   fungus begins to form on the outside of the culm  which eventually penetrates and overcomes the culm    around 58 years later  species- and climate-dependent   the fungal growths cause the culm to collapse and decay  this brief life means culms are ready for harvest and suitable for use in construction within about three to seven years  individual bamboo culms do not get any taller or larger in diameter in subsequent years than they do in their first year  and they do not replace any growth lost from pruning or natural breakage  bamboo has a wide range of hardiness depending on species and locale  small or young specimens of an individual species produce small culms initially  as the clump and its rhizome system mature  taller and larger culms are produced each year until the plant approaches its particular species limits of height and diameter 
many tropical bamboo species die at or near freezing temperatures  while some of the hardier temperate bamboos can survive temperatures as low as 29c  20f   some of the hardiest bamboo species can be grown in 5  although they typically defoliate and may even lose all above-ground growth  yet the rhizomes survive and send up shoots again the next spring  in milder climates  such as usda zone 7 and above  most bamboo remain fully leafed out and green year-round 
mass flowering

flowering bamboo
phyllostachys glauca  yunzhu  in flower
most bamboo species flower infrequently  in fact  many only flower at intervals as long as 65 or 120 years  these taxa exhibit
 or gregarious flowering   with all plants in a particular  cohort  flowering over a several-year period  any plant derived through clonal propagation from this cohort will also flower regardless of whether it has been planted in a different location  the longest mass flowering interval known is 130 years  and it is for the species
 sieb    zucc    in this species  all plants of the same stock flower at the same time  regardless of differences in geographic locations or climatic conditions  and then the bamboo dies  the lack of environmental impact on the time of flowering indicates the presence of some sort of  alarm clock  in each cell of the plant which signals the diversion of all energy to flower production and the cessation of vegetative growth  this mechanism  as well as the evolutionary cause behind it  is still largely a mystery 
one hypothesis to explain the
of this
mass flowering is the predator satiation hypothesis  which argues that by fruiting at the same time  a population increases the survival rate of its seeds by flooding the area with fruit  so even if predators eat their fill  seeds will still be left over  by having a flowering cycle longer than the lifespan of the rodent predators  bamboos can regulate animal populations by causing starvation during the period between flowering events  thus  the death of the adult clone is due to resource exhaustion  as it would be more effective for parent plants to devote all resources to creating a large seed crop than to hold back energy for their own regeneration 
another  the fire cycle hypothesis  states that periodic flowering followed by death of the adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create disturbance in the habitat  thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which to grow  this argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load  and also a large target for lightning strikes  increasing the likelihood of wildfire  because bamboos can be aggressive as early successional plants  the seedlings would be able to outstrip other plants and take over the space left by their parents 
however  both have been disputed for different reasons  the predator satiation hypothesis does not explain why the flowering cycle is 10 times longer than the lifespan of the local rodents  something not predicted  the bamboo fire cycle hypothesis is considered by a few scientists to be unreasonable  they argue that fires only result from humans and there is no natural fire in india  this notion is considered wrong based on distribution of lightning strike data during the dry season throughout india  however  another argument against this is the lack of precedent for any living organism to harness something as unpredictable as lightning strikes to increase its chance of survival as part of natural evolutionary progress 
more recently  a mathematical explanation for the extreme length of the flowering cycles has been offered  involving both the
implied by the predator satiation hypothesis and others  and the fact that plants that flower at longer intervals tend to release more seeds  the hypothesis claims that bamboo flowering intervals grew by
multiplication  a mutant bamboo plant flowering at a noninteger multiple of its population s flowering interval would release its seeds alone  and would not enjoy the benefits of collective flowering  such as protection from predators   however  a mutant bamboo plant flowering at an integer multiple of its population s flowering interval would release its seeds only during collective flowering events  and would release more seeds than the average plant in the population  it could  therefore  take over the population  establishing a flowering interval that is an integer multiple of the previous flowering interval  the hypothesis predicts that observed bamboo flowering intervals should factorize into small  
the mass fruiting also has direct economic and ecological consequences  however  the huge increase in available fruit in the forests often causes a boom in rodent populations  leading to increases in disease and famine in nearby human populations  for example  devastating consequences occur when the
bambusoides population flowers and fruits once every 3035 years around the   the death of the bamboo plants following their fruiting means the local people lose their building material  and the large increase in bamboo fruit leads to a rapid increase in rodent populations  as the number of rodents increases  they consume all available food  including grain fields and stored food  sometimes leading to   these rats can also carry dangerous diseases  such as     and   which can reach epidemic proportions as the rodents increase in number  the relationship between rat populations and bamboo flowering was examined in a 2009
documentary  
in any case  flowering produces masses of seeds  typically suspended from the ends of the branches  these seeds give rise to a new generation of plants that may be identical in appearance to those that preceded the flowering  or they may produce new cultivars with different characteristics  such as the presence or absence of striping or other changes in coloration of the culms 
several bamboo species are never known to set seed even when sporadically flowering has been reported      and
are common examples of such bamboo

bamboo used for construction purposes must be harvested when the culms reach their greatest strength and when sugar levels in the
are at their lowest  as high sugar content increases the ease and rate of
infestation 
harvesting of bamboo is typically undertaken according to these cycles 
1  lifecycle of the culm  as each individual
goes through a 5 to 7-year lifecycle  culms are ideally allowed to reach this level of maturity prior to full capacity harvesting  the clearing out or thinning of culms  particularly older decaying culms  helps to ensure adequate light and resources for new growth  well-maintained clumps may have a productivity three to four times that of an unharvested wild clump  consistent with the lifecycle described above  bamboo is harvested from two to three years through to five to seven years  depending on the species 
2  annual cycle  as all growth of new bamboo occurs during the   disturbing the clump during this phase will potentially damage the upcoming crop  also during this high-rainfall period  sap levels are at their highest  and then diminish towards the   picking immediately prior to the wet growth season may also damage new shoots  hence  harvesting is best a few months prior to the start of the wet season 
3  daily cycle  during the height of the day 
is at its peak  producing the highest levels of sugar in sap  making this the least ideal time of day to harvest  many traditional practitioners believe the best time to harvest is at dawn or dusk on a waning moon 
leaching  
leaching is the removal of sap after harvest  in many areas of the world  the sap levels in harvested bamboo are reduced either through leaching or postharvest photosynthesis  examples of this practice include 
cut bamboo is raised clear of the ground and leaned against the rest of the clump for one to two weeks until leaves turn yellow to allow full consumption of sugars by the plant 
a similar method is undertaken  but with the base of the culm standing in fresh water  either in a large drum or stream to leach out sap 
cut culms are immersed in a running stream and weighted down for three to four weeks 
water is pumped through the freshly cut culms  forcing out the sap  this method is often used in conjunction with the injection of some form of treatment  
in the process of water leaching  the bamboo is dried slowly and evenly in the shade to avoid cracking in the outer skin of the bamboo  thereby reducing opportunities for pest infestation 
durability of bamboo in construction is directly related to how well it is handled from the moment of planting through harvesting  transportation  storage  design  construction  and maintenance  bamboo harvested at the correct time of year and then exposed to ground contact or rain will break down just as quickly as incorrectly harvested material 
ornamental bamboos  
the two general patterns for the growth of bamboo are  clumping   sympodial  and     monopodial   clumping bamboo species tend to spread slowly  as the growth pattern of the rhizomes is to simply expand the root mass gradually  similar to ornamental grasses   running  bamboos  though  need to be controlled during cultivation because of their potential for aggressive behavior  they spread mainly through their
and or   which can spread widely underground and send up new culms to break through the surface  running bamboo species are highly variable in their tendency to spread  this is related to both the species and the
and
conditions  some can send out runners of several metres a year  while others can stay in the same general area for long periods  if neglected  over time  they can cause problems by moving into adjacent areas 
bamboos seldom and unpredictably flower  and the frequency of flowering varies greatly from species to species  once flowering takes place  a plant declines and often dies entirely  although a few species of bamboo are always in flower at any given time  collectors desiring to grow specific bamboo typically obtain their plants as divisions of already-growing plants  rather than waiting for seeds to be produced 
regular observations indicate major growth directions and locations  once the rhizomes are cut  they are typically removed  however  rhizomes take a number of months to mature  and an immature  severed rhizome usually ceases growing if left in-ground  if any bamboo shoots come up outside of the bamboo area afterwards  their presence indicates the precise location of the removed rhizome  the fibrous roots that radiate from the rhizomes do not produce more bamboo 
bamboo growth is also controlled by surrounding the plant or grove with a physical barrier  typically  concrete and specially rolled
plastic are the materials used to create the barrier  which is placed in a 60 to 90-cm-deep ditch around the planting  and angled out at the top to direct the rhizomes to the surface   this is only possible if the barrier is installed in a straight line   if the containment area is small  this method can be detrimental to ornamental bamboo  as the bamboo within can become rootbound and start to display the signs of any unhealthy containerized plant  in addition  rhizomes can escape over the top  or beneath the barrier if it is not deep enough  strong rhizomes and tools can penetrate plastic barriers  so care must be taken  in small areas  regular maintenance may be the best method for controlling the running bamboos  barriers and edging are unnecessary for clump-forming bamboos  although these may eventually need to have portions removed if they become too large

in its natural form  bamboo as a construction material is traditionally associated with the cultures of south asia  east asia  and the south pacific  to some extent in central and south america  and by extension in the aesthetic of   in china and india  bamboo was used to hold up   either by making cables of split bamboo or twisting whole culms of sufficiently pliable bamboo together  one such bridge in the area of qian-xian is referenced in writings dating back to 960 ad and may have stood since as far back as the third century bc  due largely to continuous maintenance 
bamboo has also long been used as scaffolding  the practice has been banned in china for buildings over six stories  but is still in continuous use for skyscrapers in hong kong  in the philippines  the
is a fairly typical example of the most basic sort of
where bamboo is used  the walls are split and woven bamboo  and bamboo slats and poles may be used as its support  in   bamboo is used primarily as a supplemental and or decorative element in buildings such as fencing  fountains  grates  and gutters  largely due to the ready abundance of quality timber 
can reach great heights 
various structural shapes may be made by training the bamboo to assume them as it grows  squared sections of bamboo are created by compressing the growing stalk within a square form  arches may similarly be created by forcing the bamboo s growth into the desired form  costing much less than it would to obtain the same shape with regular wood timber  more traditional forming methods  such as the application of heat and pressure  may also be used to curve or flatten the cut stalks 
bamboo can be cut and laminated into sheets and planks  this process involves cutting stalks into thin strips  planing them flat  and boiling and drying the strips  they are then glued  pressed  and finished  long used in china and japan  entrepreneurs started developing and selling laminated
in the west during the mid-1990s  products made from bamboo laminate  including flooring  cabinetry  furniture  and even decorations  are currently surging in popularity  transitioning from the boutique market to mainstream providers such as   the bamboo goods industry  which also includes small goods  fabric  etc   is expected to be worth  25 billion by 2012  the quality of bamboo laminate varies among manufacturers and varies according to the maturity of the plant from which it was harvested  six years being considered the optimum   the sturdiest products fulfill their claims of being up to three times harder than
