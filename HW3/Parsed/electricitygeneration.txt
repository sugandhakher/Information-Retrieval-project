history  
the fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the british scientist   this method is still used today  electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire  or
between the poles of a   central power stations became economically practical with the development of
power transmission  using power
to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss  electricity has been generated at central stations since 1882  the first power plants were run on water power or coal  and today rely mainly on           and   with supplementary amounts from     and
sources  the use of power-lines and power-poles have been significantly important in the distribution of electricity 
methods of generating electricity  
u s  2014 electricity generation by type 
sources of electricity in france in 2006 
was the main source 
there are seven fundamental methods of directly transforming other forms of energy into electrical energy 
static electricity  
  form the physical separation and transport of charge  examples 
and    it was the first form discovered and investigated  and the
is still used even in modern devices such as the
and  
electromagnetic induction  
in   an  
or
transforms
into electricity  this is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on   it can be experimented by rotating a magnet within closed loops of a conducting material  e g  copper wire   almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction  in which
forces a generator to rotate 
turbines  
almost all electrical power on earth is generated with a   driven by wind  water  steam or burning gas  the turbine drives a generator  there are many different methods of developing mechanical energy  including   hydro  wind and tidal power  most electric generation is driven by   the combustion of
supplies most of the heat to these engines  with a significant fraction from
and some from   the modern
 invented by
in 1884  currently generates about 80  of the
in the world using a variety of heat sources  power sources include 
steam
large dams such as
in china can provide large amounts of
power  it has a 22.5
capability 
water is boiled by
burned in a   about 41  of all electricity is generated this way 
heat created in a
creates steam  less than 15  of electricity is generated this way 
renewables  the steam is generated by  
where
and
concentrate sunlight to heat a heat transfer fluid  which is then used to produce steam  or  
natural gas  turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion 
are driven by both steam and natural gas  they generate power by burning natural gas in a
and use residual heat to generate steam  at least 20  of the worlds electricity is generated by natural gas 
small turbines can be powered by   this is used for back up generation  usually at low voltages  most large power grids also use   originally provided as emergency back up for a specific facility such as a hospital  to feed power into the grid during certain circumstances 
water energy is captured from the movement of water  from falling water  the rise and fall of tides or   each driving a
to produce approximately 16  of the world s electricity  the
is an early production  submerged buoy  electrical power and direct desalination installation supplying power to
in western australia 
the
was a very early   in a
wind is artificially produced  before 2010 less than 2  of the worlds electricity was produced from wind 
electrochemistry  
large dams such as
can provide large amounts of
power  it has 2.07
capability 
is the direct transformation of
into electricity  as in a   electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications  currently  most electrochemical power comes from batteries    such as the common   act as power sources directly  but many types of cells are used as
systems rather than primary generation systems  open electrochemical systems  known as   can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels 
is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges 
photovoltaic effect  
the
is the transformation of light into electrical energy  as in  
convert sunlight directly to electricity  although sunlight is free and abundant  solar electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels  low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30  conversion efficiency are now commercially available  over 40  efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems  until recently  photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid  or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses  recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology  combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns  have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels  installed capacity is growing by 40  per year led by increases in germany  japan  and the united states 
thermoelectric effect  
a coal-fired power plant in laughlin  nevada u s a  owners of this plant ceased operations after declining to invest in pollution control equipment to comply with pollution regulations 
is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electricity  as in     and  
piezoelectric effect  
the
generates electricity from the mechanical strain of electrically
molecules or crystals  researchers at the  s
have developed a
generator sufficient to operate a
using thin films of m13 bacteriophage 
devices are used for power generation from mechanical strain  particularly in  
nuclear transformation  
nuclear transformation is the creation and acceleration of charged particles  examples 
or
emission   the direct conversion of
to electricity by
is used only on a small scale  in a full-size nuclear power plant  the heat of a nuclear reaction is used to run a heat engine  this drives a generator  which converts mechanical energy into electricity by magnetic induction 
are a type of solid-state power generator which produces electricity from radioactive decay  fluid-based
 mhd  power generation has been studied as a method for extracting electrical power from
and also from more conventional fuel combustion systems 
usually provide electrical generation in conjunction with other methods of producing power 
economics of generation and production of electricity  
see also 
the selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region  the economics vary considerably around the world  resulting in widespread selling prices  e g  the price in venezuela is 3 cents per kwh while in denmark it is 40 cents per kwh     
and
have their own pros and cons  and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand  all power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load  supplied by plants which run continuously  nuclear  coal  oil and gas plants can supply base load 
is economical in areas of high industrial density  as the high demand cannot be met by renewable sources  the effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas  these plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units  nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit  however  recent disasters in japan have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power  and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high  hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power  it is not an economically viable source of production where the load varies too much during the annual production cycle and the ability to store the flow of water is limited 
due to advancements in technology  and with mass production  renewable sources other than hydroelectricity  solar power  wind energy  tidal power  etc   experienced decreases in cost of production  and the energy is now in many cases cost-comparative with fossil fuels  many governments around the world provide subsidies to offset the higher cost of any new power production  and to make the installation of renewable energy systems economically feasible  however  their use is frequently limited by their   if natural gas prices are below  3 per million   generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal
