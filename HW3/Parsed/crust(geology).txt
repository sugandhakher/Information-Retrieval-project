earth s crust
the internal structure of earth
the crust of the
is composed of a great variety of     and   the crust is underlain by the mantle  the upper part of the mantle is composed mostly of   a rock denser than rocks common in the overlying crust  the boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the   a boundary defined by a contrast in
velocity  the crust occupies less than 1  of earth s volume 
the

the oceanic crust is 5km  3mi  to 10km  6mi  thick and is composed primarily of     and  
the continental crust is typically from 30km  20mi  to 50km  30mi  thick and is mostly composed of slightly less dense rocks than those of the oceanic crust  some of these less dense rocks  such as   are common in the continental crust but rare to absent in the oceanic crust 
both the continental and oceanic crust   because the continental crust is thicker  it extends both to greater elevations and greater depth than the oceanic crust  the slightly lower density of felsic continental rock compared to basaltic oceanic rock contributes to the higher relative elevation of the top of the continental crust  as the top of the continental crust reaches elevations higher than that of the oceanic  water runs off the continents and collects above the oceanic crust  because of the change in velocity of
it is believed that beneath continents at a certain depth continental crust    becomes close in its physical properties to oceanic crust     and the transition zone is referred to as the  
the temperature of the crust increases with depth  reaching values typically in the range from about 200c  392f  to 400c  752f  at the boundary with the underlying mantle  the crust and underlying relatively rigid uppermost mantle make up the   because of

plates in the crust of earth
partly by analogy to what is known about the moon  earth is considered to have differentiated from an aggregate of
into its core  mantle and crust within about 100 million years of the formation of the planet  4.6 billion years ago  the
crust was very thin and was probably recycled by much more vigorous
and destroyed by significant
impacts  which were much more common in the early stages of the solar system 
earth has probably always had some form of basaltic crust  but the age of the oldest oceanic crust today is only about 200 million years  in contrast  the bulk of the continental crust is much older  the oldest continental crustal rocks on earth have ages in the range from about 3.7 to 4.28 billion years
and have been found in the

the average age of the current earth s continental crust has been estimated to be about 2.0 billion years  most crustal rocks formed before 2.5 billion years ago are located in   such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in earth and so are not readily destroyed by   formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense   these periods coincide with the formation of the

and   the crust forms in part by aggregation of
including granite and metamorphic fold belts  and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle

of elements  these have been depleted by being relocated deeper into earth s core  their abundance in
materials is higher  additionally  tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides 
the continental crust has an average composition similar to that of   continental crust is enriched in

ocean crust and much enriched compared to the underlying mantle  although the continental crust comprises only about 0.6 weight percent of the silicate on earth  it contains 20  to 70  of the incompatible elements

and   but even that lower part probably averages about 78  plagioclase  the underlying mantle is denser and olivine-rich 
the thickness of the crust ranges between about 20 and 120km  crust on the
averages about 12km thicker than that on the   estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about 50 to 60km  most of this plagioclase-rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon  between about 4.5 and 4.3 billion years ago  perhaps 10  or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase-rich material  the best-characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare

study of the moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than earth  although the radius of the moon is only about a quarter that of earth  the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness  this thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the moon  magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about 3.9 billion years ago  but igneous rocks younger than 3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust
