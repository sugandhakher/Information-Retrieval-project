flywheel energy storage  fes  works by accelerating a rotor    to a very high speed and maintaining the energy in the system as   when energy is extracted from the system  the flywheel s rotational speed is reduced as a consequence of the principle of   adding energy to the system correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel 
most fes systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel  but devices that directly use
are being developed  since fes can be used to absorb or release electrical energy  such devices may sometimes be incorrectly   and confusingly described as either mechanical or
batteries 
advanced fes systems have rotors made of high strength carbon-fiber composites  suspended by   and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm in a vacuum enclosure  such flywheels can come up to speed in a matter of minutes reaching their energy capacity much more quickly than some other forms of storage

the expense of refrigeration led to the early dismissal of low-temperature superconductors for use in magnetic bearings  however 
 htsc  bearings may be economical and could possibly extend the time energy could be stored economically  hybrid bearing systems are most likely to see use first  high-temperature superconductor bearings have historically had problems providing the lifting forces necessary for the larger designs  but can easily provide a stabilizing force  therefore  in hybrid bearings  permanent magnets support the load and high-temperature superconductors are used to stabilize it  the reason superconductors can work well stabilizing the load is because they are perfect   if the rotor tries to drift off center  a restoring force due to
restores it  this is known as the magnetic stiffness of the bearing  rotational axis vibration can occur due to low stiffness and damping  which are inherent problems of superconducting magnets  preventing the use of completely superconducting magnetic bearings for flywheel applications 
since flux pinning is an important factor for providing the stabilizing and lifting force  the htsc can be made much more easily for fes than for other uses  htsc powders can be formed into arbitrary shapes so long as flux pinning is strong  an ongoing challenge that has to be overcome before superconductors can provide the full lifting force for an fes system is finding a way to suppress the decrease of levitation force and the gradual fall of rotor during operation caused by the
of the superconducting material

general  
compared with other ways to store electricity  fes systems have long lifetimes  lasting decades with little or no maintenance  full-cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of 105  up to 107  cycles of use   high
 100130wh kg  or 360500 kj kg   and large maximum power output  the
 ratio of energy out per energy in  of flywheels  also known as round-trip efficiency  can be as high as 90   typical capacities range from 3 to 133kwh  rapid charging of a system occurs in less than 15 minutes  the high specific energies often cited with flywheels can be a little misleading as commercial systems built have much lower specific energy  for example 11 wh kg  or 40 kj kg 
specific energy  
the maximum
of a flywheel rotor is mainly dependent on two factors  the first being the rotor s geometry  and the second being the properties of the material being used  for single-material 
rotors this relationship can be expressed as
e
m
 
k
 


 
  displaystyle   frac  e  m   k left   frac   sigma    rho    right  
 
where the variables are defined as follows 
e
  displaystyle e 
- kinetic energy of the rotor  j 
m
  displaystyle m 
- the rotor s mass  kg 
k
  displaystyle k 
- the rotor s geometric shape factor  dimensionless 

  displaystyle  sigma  
- the tensile strength of the material  pa 

  displaystyle  rho  
- the material s density  kg m3 
geometry  shape factor   
the highest possible value for the shape factor of a flywheel rotor  is
k
 
1
  displaystyle k 1 
  which can only be achieved by the theoretical constant-stress disc geometry  a constant-thickness disc geometry has a shape factor of
k
 
0.606
  displaystyle k 0.606 
  while for a rod of constant thickness the value is
k
 
0.333
  displaystyle k 0.333 
  a thin cylinder has a shape factor of

material properties  
for energy storage purposes  materials with high strength  and low density are desirable  for this reason  composite materials are frequently being used in advanced flywheels  the
of a material can be expressed in wh kg  or nm kg   values greater than 400 wh kg can be achieved by certain composite materials 
rotor materials  
several modern flywheel rotors are made from composite materials  examples include the carbon fiber composite flywheel from beacon power corporation and the powerthru flywheel from phillips service industries  alternatively  calnetix utilizes aerospace grade high-performance steel in their flywheel construction 
for these rotors  the relationship between material properties  geometry and energy density can be expressed by using a weighed-average approach 
tensile strength and failure modes  
one of the primary limits to flywheel design is the tensile strength of the material used for the rotor  generally speaking  the stronger the disc  the faster it may be spun  and the more energy the system can store 
when the tensile strength of a composite flywheel s outer binding cover is exceeded  the binding cover will fracture  followed by the wheel shattering as the outer wheel compression is lost around the entire circumference  releasing all of its stored energy at once  this is commonly referred to as  flywheel explosion  since wheel fragments can reach kinetic energy comparable to that of a bullet  composite materials that are wound and glued in layers tend to disintegrate quickly  first into small-diameter filaments that entangle and slow each other  and then into red-hot powder  instead of large chunks of high-velocity shrapnel as can occur with a cast metal flywheel 
for a
flywheel  the failure limit is the binding strength of the
of the
molded metal  aluminum in particular suffers from
and can develop
due to repeated low-energy stretching  angular forces may cause portions of a metal flywheel to bend outward and begin dragging on the outer containment vessel  or to separate completely and bounce randomly around the interior  the rest of the flywheel is now severely unbalanced  which may lead to rapid bearing failure from vibration  and sudden shock fracturing of large segments of the flywheel 
traditional flywheel systems require strong containment vessels as a safety precaution  which increases the total mass of the device  the energy release from failure can be dampened with a gelatinous or encapsulated liquid inner housing lining  which will boil and absorb the energy of destruction  still  many customers of large-scale flywheel energy-storage systems prefer to have them embedded in the ground to halt any material that might escape the containment vessel 
energy storage efficiency  
flywheel energy storage systems using mechanical bearings can lose 20  to 50  of their energy in two hours  much of the friction responsible for this energy loss results from the flywheel changing orientation due to the rotation of the earth  an effect similar to that shown by a    this change in orientation is resisted by the gyroscopic forces exerted by the flywheel s angular momentum  thus exerting a force against the mechanical bearings  this force increases friction  this can be avoided by aligning the flywheel s axis of rotation parallel to that of the earth s axis of rotation 
conversely  flywheels with
and high vacuum can maintain 97    and 85  round trip efficiency 
effects of angular momentum in vehicles  
when used in vehicles  flywheels also act as   since their
is typically of a similar order of magnitude as the forces acting on the moving vehicle  this property may be detrimental to the vehicle s handling characteristics while turning or driving on rough ground  driving onto the side of a sloped embankment may cause wheels to partially lift off the ground as the flywheel opposes sideways tilting forces  on the other hand  this property could be utilized to keep the car balanced so as to keep it from rolling over during sharp turns 
when a flywheel is used entirely for its effects on the attitude of a vehicle  rather than for energy storage  it is called a
or a  
the resistance of angular tilting can be almost completely removed by mounting the flywheel within an appropriately applied set of   allowing the flywheel to retain its original orientation without affecting the vehicle  see    this doesn t avoid the complication of   and so a compromise between the number of gimbals and the angular freedom is needed 
the center axle of the flywheel acts as a single gimbal  and if aligned vertically  allows for the 360 degrees of yaw in a horizontal plane  however  for instance driving up-hill requires a second pitch gimbal  and driving on the side of a sloped embankment requires a third roll gimbal 
full-motion gimbals  
although the flywheel itself may be of a flat ring shape  a free-movement gimbal mounting inside a vehicle requires a spherical volume for the flywheel to freely rotate within  left to its own  a spinning flywheel in a vehicle would slowly precess following the earth s rotation  and precess further yet in vehicles that travel long distances over the earth s curved spherical surface 
a full-motion gimbal has additional problems of how to communicate power into and out of the flywheel  since the flywheel could potentially flip completely over once a day  precessing as the earth rotates  full free rotation would require
around each gimbal axis for power conductors  further adding to the design complexity 
limited-motion gimbals  
to reduce space usage  the gimbal system may be of a limited-movement design  using shock absorbers to cushion sudden rapid motions within a certain number of degrees of out-of-plane angular rotation  and then gradually forcing the flywheel to adopt the vehicle s current orientation  this reduces the gimbal movement space around a ring-shaped flywheel from a full sphere  to a short thickened cylinder  encompassing for example  30 degrees of pitch and  30 degrees of roll in all directions around the flywheel 
counterbalancing of angular momentum  
an alternative solution to the problem is to have two joined flywheels spinning synchronously in opposite directions  they would have a total angular momentum of zero and no gyroscopic effect  a problem with this solution is that when the difference between the momentum of each flywheel is anything other than zero the housing of the two flywheels would exhibit torque  both wheels must be maintained at the same speed to keep the angular velocity at zero  strictly speaking  the two flywheels would exert a huge
moment at the central point  trying to bend the axle  however  if the axle were sufficiently strong  no gyroscopic forces would have a net effect on the sealed container  so no torque would be noticed 
to further balance the forces and spread out strain  a single large flywheel can be balanced by two half-size flywheels on each side  or the flywheels can be reduced in size to be a series of alternating layers spinning in opposite directions  however this increases housing and bearing complexity 
applications  
transportation  
automotive  
in the 1950s  flywheel-powered buses  known as   were used in
   and
   and there is ongoing research to make flywheel systems that are smaller  lighter  cheaper and have a greater capacity  it is hoped that flywheel systems can replace conventional chemical batteries for mobile applications  such as for electric vehicles  proposed flywheel systems would eliminate many of the disadvantages of existing battery power systems  such as low capacity  long charge times  heavy weight and short usable lifetimes  flywheels may have been used in the experimental   though that has been disputed 
flywheels have also been proposed for use in   punch powertrain is currently working on such a device 
during the 1990s 
developed a
powered
automotive powertrain using a 55,000 rpm flywheel to provide bursts of acceleration which the small gas turbine engine could not provide  the flywheel also stored energy through   the flywheel was composed of a
hub with a
cylinder and was -mounted to minimize adverse gyroscopic effects on vehicle handling  the prototype vehicle was successfully road tested in 1997 but was never mass-produced 
in 2013 
announced a flywheel system fitted to the rear axle of its s60 sedan  braking action spins the flywheel at up to 60,000 rpm and stops the front-mounted engine  flywheel energy is applied via a special transmission to partially or completely power the vehicle  the 20-centimetre  7.9in   6-kilogram  13lb 
flywheel spins in a vacuum to eliminate friction  when partnered with a four-cylinder engine  it offers up to a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption versus a comparably performing turbo six-cylinder  providing an 80hp boost and allowing it to reach 100 kilometres per hour  62mph  in 5.5 seconds  the company did not announce specific plans to include the technology in its product line 
in july 2014
acquired
hybrid power  whp  division and intends to supply 500
gyrodrive electric flywheel systems to urban bus operators over the next two years as the former developer name implies  these were originally designed for
applications  in september 2014 
announced that it is introducing 14 gyrodrive hybrid buses by
on its brookes bus operation 
rail vehicles  
flywheel systems have been used experimentally in small
for shunting or   e g  the   larger electric locomotives  e g    have sometimes been fitted with flywheel boosters to carry them over gaps in the   advanced flywheels  such as the 133kwh pack of the   can take a train from a standing start up to cruising speed 
the

in the  
during 2006 and 2007 and was intended to be introduced as a full service by the train operator
in december 2008 once two units had been ordered  in january 2010  both units are in operation 
rail electrification  
fes can be used at the lineside of electrified railways to help regulate the line voltage thus improving the acceleration of unmodified electric trains and the amount of energy recovered back to the line during   thus lowering energy bills  trials have taken place in london  new york  lyon and tokyo  and  s
is now investing  5.2m in a pilot project on lirr s
line  these trials and systems store kinetic energy in rotors consisting of a carbon-glass composite cylinder packed with neodymium-iron-boron powder that forms a permanent magnet  these spin at up to 37800rev min  and each 100kw unit can store 11 mj of re-usable energy 
uninterruptible power supplies  
flywheel power storage systems in production as of 2001 have storage capacities comparable to batteries and faster discharge rates  they are mainly used to provide load leveling for large battery systems  such as an
for data centers as they save a considerable amount of space compared to battery systems 
flywheel maintenance in general runs about one-half the cost of traditional battery ups systems  the only maintenance is a basic annual preventive maintenance routine and replacing the bearings every five to ten years  which takes about four hours  newer flywheel systems completely levitate the spinning mass using maintenance-free   thus eliminating mechanical bearing maintenance and failures 
costs of a fully installed flywheel ups  including power conditioning  are  in 2009  about  330 per
 for 15 seconds full-load capacity  
test laboratories  
a long-standing niche market for flywheel power systems are facilities where circuit-breakers and similar devices are tested  even a small household circuit-breaker may be rated to interrupt a current of 10,000 or more amperes  and larger units may have
of 100,000 or 1,000,000 amperes  the enormous transient loads produced by deliberately forcing such devices to demonstrate their ability to interrupt simulated short circuits would have unacceptable effects on the local grid if these tests were done directly from building power  typically such a laboratory will have several large motor-generator sets  which can be spun up to speed over some minutes  then the motor is disconnected before a circuit breaker is tested 
physics laboratories  
fusion experiments need very high currents for brief intervals  mainly to power large electromagnets for a few seconds

lower carbon emissions  faster response times and ability to buy power at off-peak hours are among some advantages of using flywheels instead of traditional sources of energy for peaking power plants

toys  
used to power many   trucks  trains  action toys and such  are simple flywheel motors 
toggle action presses  
in industry 
are still popular  the usual arrangement involves a very strong
and a heavy duty connecting rod which drives the press  large and heavy flywheels are driven by electric motors but the flywheels only turn the crankshaft when clutches are activated 
comparison to electric batteries  
flywheels are not as adversely affected by temperature changes  can operate at a much wider temperature range  and are not subject to many of the common failures of chemical   they are also less potentially damaging to the environment  being largely made of
or benign materials  another advantage of flywheels is that by a simple measurement of the rotation speed it is possible to know the exact amount of energy stored 
unlike most batteries which only operate for a finite period  for example roughly 36 months in the case of    a flywheel potentially has an indefinite working lifespan  flywheels built as part of
have been continuously working for more than two hundred years    working examples of ancient flywheels used mainly in milling and pottery can be found in many locations in africa  asia  and europe 
most modern flywheels are typically a sealed device that needs minimal maintenance throughout its service life  magnetic bearing flywheels in a vacuum enclosure  such as the nasa model depicted above  do not need any bearing maintenance and are therefore superior to batteries both in terms of total lifetime and energy storage capacity  flywheel systems with mechanical bearings will have a limited lifespan due to wear 
the arrangement of batteries can be designed to a wide variety of configurations  whereas a flywheel at a minimum must occupy a square surface area  where space is a constraint for the application of energy storage  e g  under trains in tunnels  the flywheel may not be a valid application
