this article is about sustainable energy use  for the law of conservation of energy in physics  see  
part of a series about
energy conservation
energy conservation refers to reducing
through using less of an energy service  energy conservation differs from   which refers to using less energy for a constant service  driving less is an example of energy conservation  driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle is an example of energy efficiency  energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques  energy conservation is a part of the concept of  
even though energy conservation reduces energy services  it can result in increased
quality   
and higher   it is at the top of the sustainable   it also lowers energy costs by preventing future

energy tax  
some countries employ
or
to motivate energy users to reduce their consumption  carbon taxes can allow consumption to shift to nuclear power and other alternatives that carry a different set of environmental side effects and limitations  meanwhile  taxes on all energy consumption stand to reduce energy use across the board  while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production  the state of california employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax  as usage increases above that baseline  the tax is increasing drastically  such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers 
building design  
one of the primary ways to improve energy conservation in buildings is to use an   an energy audit is an
and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building  process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output s   this is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above  in addition  recent development of
apps enable homeowners to complete relativily sophisticated energy audits themselves 
building technologies and smart meters can allow energy users  business and residential  to see graphically the impact their energy use can have in their workplace or homes  advanced real-time energy metering is able to help people save energy by their actions 
elements of passive solar design  shown in a direct gain application
in   windows  walls  and floors are made to collect  store  and distribute
in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer  this is called passive solar design or climatic design because  unlike active
systems  it doesn t involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices 
the key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local   elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type      and shading  passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings  but existing buildings can be retrofitted 
transportation  
in the united states  suburban infrastructure evolved during an age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels  which has led to transportation-dependent systems of living  zoning reforms that allow greater
as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation  the use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy  as many americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day 
consumer products  
an assortment of energy-efficient semiconductor  led  lamps for commercial and residential lighting use  led lamps use at least 75  less energy  and last 25 times longer  than traditional incandescent light bulbs 
consumers are often poorly informed of the savings of energy efficient products  a prominent example of this is the energy savings that can be made by replacing an
with a more modern alternative  when purchasing light bulbs  many consumers opt for cheap incandescent bulbs  failing to take into account their higher energy costs and lower lifespans when compared to modern
and   although these energy-efficient alternatives have a higher upfront cost  their long lifespan and low energy use can save consumers a considerable amount of money  the price of leds has also been steadily decreasing in the past five years  due to improvement of the semiconductor technology  many led bulbs on the market qualify for utility rebates that further reduce the price of purchase to the consumer  estimates by the u s  department of energy state that widespread adoption of led lighting over the next 20 years could result in about  265 billion worth of savings in united states energy costs 
the research one must put into conserving energy is often too time consuming and costly for the average consumer  when there are cheaper products and technology available using today s fossil fuels  some governments and ngos are attempting to reduce this complexity with
that make differences in energy efficiency easy to research while shopping 
to provide the kind of information and support people need to invest money  time and effort in energy conservation  it is important to understand and link to people s topical concerns  for instance  some retailers argue that bright
stimulates purchasing  however  health studies have demonstrated that       fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common
present in many workplace and retail settings  it has been shown that natural
increases productivity levels of workers  while reducing energy consumption 
in warm climates where air conditioning is used  any household device that gives off heat will result in a larger load on the cooling system  items such as a stove  dish washer  clothes dryer  hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home  low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the air conditioning to remove  the air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water 
in cold climates heating air and water is a major demand on household energy use  by investing in newer technologies in the home  significant energy reductions are possible 
are a more efficient alternative to using electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water  a variety of efficient
are available  and the classic
requires no energy  only time  natural gas
and hot air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot flue models  new construction implementing
can capture heat from waste water or exhaust air in bathrooms  laundry and kitchens 
in both warm and cold climate extremes  airtight thermal
will largely determine the efficiency of a home  insulation is added to minimize the flow of heat to or from the home  but can be labor-intensive to retrofit to an existing home 
energy conservation by the countries  
asia  
despite the vital role energy efficiency is envisaged to play in cost-effectively cutting energy demand  only a small part of its economic potential is exploited in the asia  governments have implemented a range of subsidies such as cash grants  cheap credit  tax exemptions  and co-financing with public-sector funds to encourage a range of energy-efficiency initiatives across several sectors  governments in the asia-pacific region have implemented a range of information provision and labeling programs for buildings  appliances  and the transportation and industrial sectors  information programs can simply provide data  such as fuel-economy labels  or actively seek to encourage behavioral changes  such as japans
that encourages setting air conditioners at 28-degrees celsius and allowing employees to dress casually in the summer 
european union  
at the end of 2006  the
 eu  pledged to cut its annual consumption of primary energy by 20  by 2020  the  european union energy efficiency action plan  is long awaited  directive 2012/27 eu is on energy efficiency 
as part of the eu s save programme  aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behaviour  the
efficiency directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels 
india  
 pcra  is an indian government body created in 1977 and engaged in promoting energy efficiency and conservation in every walk of life  in the recent past pcra has done mass media campaigns in television  radio   print media  an impact assessment survey by a third party revealed that due to these mega campaigns by pcra  overall awareness level have gone up leading to saving of fossil fuels worth crores of rupees indian currency  besides reducing pollution 
is an indian governmental organization created in 2001 responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation

since the   energy conservation has been an issue in   all oil based fuel is imported  so indigenous
is being developed 
the energy conservation center promotes energy efficiency in every aspect of   public entities are implementing the efficient use of energy for industries and research  it includes projects such as the top runner program  in this project  new appliances are regularly tested on efficiency  and the most efficient ones are made the standard 
lebanon  
in lebanon and since 2002
has been promoting the development of efficient and rational uses of energy and the use of renewable energy at the consumer level  it was created as a project financed by the international environment facility  gef  and the ministry of energy water  mew  under the management of the united nations development programme  undp  and gradually established itself as an independent technical national center although it continues to be supported by the united nations development programme  undp  as indicated in the memorandum of understanding  mou  signed between mew and undp on june 18  2007 
nepal  
until recently 
has been focusing on the exploitation of its huge water resources to produce hydro power  demand side management and energy conservation was not in the focus of government action  in 2009  bilateral development cooperation between nepal and the federal republic of germany  has agreed upon the joint implementation of nepal energy efficiency programme  the lead executing agencies for the implementation are the water and energy commission secretariat  wecs   the aim of the programme is the promotion of energy efficiency in policy making  in rural and urban households as well as in the industry  due to the lack of a government organization that promotes energy efficiency in the country  the
has established the energy efficiency centre under his roof to promote energy conservation in the private sector  the energy efficiency centre is a non-profit initiative that is offering energy auditing services to the industries  the centre is also supported by nepal energy efficiency programme of   a study conducted in 2012 found out that nepalese industries could save 160,000 megawatt hours of electricity and 8,000 terajoule of thermal energy  like diesel  furnace oil and coal  every year  these savings are equivalent to annual energy cost cut of up to 6.4 billion nepalese rupees  as a result of nepal economic forum 2014  an economic reform agenda in the priority sectors was declared focusing on energy conservation among others  in the energy reform agenda the government of nepal gave the commitment to introduce incentive packages in the budget of the fiscal year 2015/16 for industries that practices energy efficiency or use efficient technologies  incl  cogeneration
