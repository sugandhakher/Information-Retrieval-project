algae fuel or algal biofuel is an
that uses
as its source of energy-rich oils  also  algae fuels are an alternative to common known biofuel sources  such as corn and sugarcane  several companies and government agencies are funding efforts to reduce capital and operating costs and make algae fuel production commercially viable  like fossil fuel  algae fuel releases co2 when burnt  but unlike fossil fuel  algae fuel and other biofuels only release co2 recently removed from the atmosphere via photosynthesis as the algae or plant grew  the energy crisis and the
have ignited interest in
 farming algae  for making
and other
using land unsuitable for agriculture  among algal fuels  attractive characteristics are that they can be grown with minimal impact on
resources  can be produced using saline and   have a high   and are
and relatively harmless to the environment if spilled  algae cost more per unit mass than other second-generation biofuel crops due to high capital and operating costs  but are claimed to yield between 10 and 100 times more fuel per unit area  the
estimates that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the united states  it would require 15,000 square miles  39,000km2   which is only 0.42  of the u s  map  or about half of the land area of   this is less than 17 the area of
harvested in the united states in 2000 
according to the head of the algal biomass organization  algae fuel can reach price parity with oil in 2018 if granted production   however  in 2013

history  
in 1942 harder and von witsch were the first to propose that
be grown as a source of lipids for food or fuel  following world war ii  research began in the us  germany  japan  england  and israel on culturing techniques and engineering systems for growing microalgae on larger scales  particularly species in the genus   meanwhile 
showed that
could be induced via nitrogen starvation to accumulate as much as 70  of its dry weight as lipids  since the need for alternative transportation fuel had subsided after world war ii  research at this time focused on culturing algae as a food source or  in some cases  for wastewater treatment 
interest in the application of algae for biofuels was rekindled during the oil embargo and oil price surges of the 1970s  leading the us department of energy to initiate the
in 1978  the aquatic species program spent  25 million over 18 years with the goal of developing liquid transportation fuel from algae that would be price competitive with petroleum-derived fuels  the research program focused on the cultivation of microalgae in open outdoor ponds  systems which are low in cost but vulnerable to environmental disturbances like temperature swings and biological invasions  3,000 algal strains were collected from around the country and screened for desirable properties such as high productivity  lipid content  and thermal tolerance  and the most promising strains were included in the seri microalgae collection at the
 seri  in golden  colorado and used for further research  among the programs most significant findings were that rapid growth and high lipid production were  mutually exclusive   since the former required high nutrients and the latter required low nutrients  the final report suggested that
may be necessary to be able to overcome this and other natural limitations of algal strains  and that the ideal species might vary with place and season  although it was successfully demonstrated that large-scale production of algae for fuel in outdoor ponds was feasible  the program failed to do so at a cost that would be competitive with petroleum  especially as oil prices sank in the 1990s  even in the best case scenario  it was estimated that unextracted algal oil would cost  59186 per barrel  while petroleum cost less than  20 per barrel in 1995  therefore  under budget pressure in 1996  the aquatic species program was abandoned 
other contributions to algal biofuels research have come indirectly from projects focusing on different applications of algal cultures  for example  in the 1990s japans research institute of innovative technology for the earth  rite  implemented a research program with the goal of developing systems to fix co
2 using microalgae  although the goal was not energy production  several studies produced by rite demonstrated that algae could be grown using flue gas from power plants as a co
2 source  an important development for algal biofuel research  other work focusing on harvesting hydrogen gas  methane  or ethanol from algae  as well as nutritional supplements and pharmaceutical compounds  has also helped inform research on biofuel production from algae 
following the disbanding of the aquatic species program in 1996  there was a relative lull in algal biofuel research  still  various projects were funded in the us by the           state funding  and private funding  as well as in other countries  more recently  rising oil prices in the 2000s spurred a revival of interest in algal biofuels and us federal funding has increased  numerous research projects are being funded in australia  new zealand  europe  the middle east  and other parts of the world  and a wave of private companies has entered the field  see    in november 2012 
and propel fuels made the first retail sales of algae-derived fuel  and in march 2013
began commercial sales of algal biofuel to  
fuels  
algae can be converted into various types of fuels  depending on the technique and the part of the cells used  the   or oily part of the algae biomass can be extracted and converted into biodiesel through a process similar to that used for any other vegetable oil  or converted in a refinery into  drop-in  replacements for petroleum-based fuels  alternatively or following lipid extraction  the
content of algae can be fermented into
or  
biodiesel  
main article 
biodiesel is a diesel fuel derived from animal or plant lipids  oils and fats   studies have shown that some species of algae can produce 60  or more of their dry weight in the form of oil  because the cells grow in aqueous suspension  where they have more efficient access to water  co
2 and dissolved nutrients  microalgae are capable of producing large amounts of biomass and usable oil in either high rate algal ponds or   this oil can then be turned into
which could be sold for use in automobiles  regional production of microalgae and processing into biofuels will provide economic benefits to rural communities 
as they do not have to produce structural compounds such as cellulose for leaves  stems  or roots  and because they can be grown floating in a rich nutritional medium  microalgae can have faster growth rates than terrestrial crops  also  they can convert a much higher fraction of their biomass to oil than conventional crops  e g  60  versus 2-3  for soybeans  the per unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from 58,700 to 136,900 l ha year  depending on lipid content  which is 10 to 23 times as high as the next highest yielding crop  oil palm  at 5,950 l ha year 
  19781996  focused on biodiesel from microalgae  the final report suggested that
could be the only viable method by which to produce enough fuel to replace current world diesel usage  if algae-derived biodiesel were to replace the annual global production of 1.1bn tons of conventional diesel then a land mass of 57.3 million hectares would be required  which would be highly favorable compared to other biofuels 
biobutanol  
main article 
butanol can be made from
or
using only a solar powered   this fuel has an
10  less than gasoline  and greater than that of either
or   in most gasoline engines  butanol can be used in place of gasoline with no modifications  in several tests  butanol consumption is similar to that of gasoline  and when blended with gasoline  provides better performance and corrosion resistance than that of ethanol or  
the green waste left over from the algae oil extraction can be used to produce butanol  in addition  it has been shown that macroalgae  seaweeds  can be fermented by
genus bacteria to butanol and other solvents 
biogasoline  
is gasoline produced from   like traditionally produced gasoline  it contains between 6    and 12    carbon atoms per molecule and can be used in  
methane  
  the main constituent of
can be produced from algae in various methods  namely  
and   in gasification and pyrolysis methods methane is extracted under high temperature and pressure  anaerobic digestion is a straightforward method involved in decomposition of algae into simple components then transforming it into
using
like acidific bacteria followed by removing any solid particles and finally adding
bacteria to release a gas mixture containing methane  a number of studies have successfully shown that biomass from microalgae can be converted into biogas via anaerobic digestion  therefore  in order to improve the overall energy balance of microalgae cultivation operations  it has been proposed to recover the energy contained in waste biomass via anaerobic digestion to methane for generating electricity 
ethanol  
the
system which is being commercialized by
in     mexico utilizes seawater and industrial exhaust to produce ethanol 
also have shown to be potentially suitable for ethanol production due to its capacity for accumulating large amount of carbohydrates 
green diesel  
main article 
algae can be used to produce     also known as renewable diesel  hydrotreating vegetable oil or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel  through a hydrotreating refinery process that breaks molecules down into shorter
chains used in
engines  it has the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel meaning that it does not require new engines  pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use  it has yet to be produced at a cost that is competitive with   while hydrotreating is currently the most common pathway to produce fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarboxylation decarbonylation  an alternative process offering a number of important advantages over hydrotreating  in this regard  the work of crocker et al  and lercher et al  is particularly noteworthy  for of oil refining  research is underway for catalytic conversion of   as the oxygen is present in crude oil at rather low levels  of the order of 0.5   deoxygenation in petroleum refining is not of
much concern  and no catalysts are specifically formulated for oxygenates hydrotreating  hence  one of the critical technical challenges to make the hydrodeoxygenation of algae oil process economically feasible is related to the research and development of effective catalysts 
jet fuel  
main article 
rising
prices are putting severe pressure on airline companies  creating an incentive for algal jet fuel research  the international air transport association  for example  supports research  development and deployment of algal fuels  iata s goal is for its members to be using 10  alternative fuels by 2017 
trials have been carried with aviation biofuel by     and  
in february 2010  the
announced that the u s  military was about to begin large-scale oil production from algal ponds into jet fuel  after extraction at a cost of  2 per gallon  the oil will be refined at less than  3 a gallon  a larger-scale refining operation  producing 50 million gallons a year  is expected to go into production in 2013  with the possibility of lower per gallon costs so that algae-based fuel would be competitive with fossil fuels  the projects  run by the companies
and   are expected to produce 1,000 gallons of oil per acre per year from algal ponds 
species  
research into algae for the mass-production of oil focuses mainly on
 organisms capable of photosynthesis that are less than 0.4mm in diameter  including the
and   as opposed to macroalgae  such as   the preference for microalgae has come about due largely to their less complex structure  fast growth rates  and high oil-content  for some species   however  some research is being done into using seaweeds for biofuels  probably due to the high availability of this resource 
as of 2012 researchers across various locations worldwide have started investigating the following species for their suitability as a mass oil-producers 
 also called ccmp647  
  with 10 times the output volume of gracilaria

photobioreactor from glass tubes
design of a race-way open pond commonly used for algal culture
algae grow much faster than food crops  and can produce hundreds of times more oil per unit area than conventional crops such as rapeseed  palms  soybeans  or   as algae have a harvesting cycle of 110 days  their cultivation permits several harvests in a very short time-frame  a strategy differing from that associated with annual crops  in addition  algae can be grown on land unsuitable for terrestrial crops  including arid land and land with excessively saline soil  minimizing competition with agriculture  most research on algae cultivation has focused on growing algae in clean but expensive   or in open ponds  which are cheap to maintain but prone to contamination 
closed-loop system  
the lack of equipment and structures needed to begin growing algae in large quantities has inhibited widespread mass-production of algae for biofuel production  maximum use of existing agriculture processes and hardware is the goal 
closed systems  not exposed to open air  avoid the problem of contamination by other organisms blown in by the air  the problem for a closed system is finding a cheap source of sterile co
2  several experimenters have found the co
2 from a smokestack works well for growing algae  for reasons of economy  some experts think that algae farming for biofuels will have to be done as part of   where it can make use of waste heat and help soak up pollution 
photobioreactors  
most companies pursuing algae as a source of biofuels pump -rich water through plastic or borosilicate glass tubes  called      that are exposed to sunlight  and so-called
or pbr  
running a pbr is more difficult than using an open pond  and costlier  but may provide a higher level of control and productivity  in addition  a photobioreactor can be integrated into a closed loop cogeneration system much more easily than ponds or other methods 
open pond  
raceway pond used for the cultivation of microalgae
open-pond systems for the most part have been given up for the cultivation of algae with especially high oil content  many   believe that a major flaw of the
was the decision to focus their efforts exclusively on open-ponds  this makes the entire effort dependent upon the hardiness of the strain chosen  requiring it to be unnecessarily resilient in order to withstand wide swings in temperature and ph  and competition from invasive algae and bacteria  open systems using a monoculture are also vulnerable to viral infection  the energy that a high-oil strain invests into the production of oil is energy that is not invested into the production of proteins or carbohydrates  usually resulting in the species being less hardy  or having a slower growth rate  algal species with a lower oil content  not having to divert their energies away from growth  can be grown more effectively in the harsher conditions of an open system 
some open sewage-ponds trial production has taken place in   new zealand 
algal turf scrubber  
2.5 acre ats system  installed by hydromentia on a farm creek in florida
the algal turf scrubber  ats  is a system designed primarily for cleaning nutrients and pollutants out of water using algal turfs  ats mimics the algal turfs of a natural coral reef by taking in nutrient rich water from waste streams or natural water sources  and pulsing it over a sloped surface  this surface is coated with a rough plastic membrane or a screen  which allows naturally occurring algal spores to settle and colonize the surface  once the algae has been established  it can be harvested every 515 days  and can produce 18 metric tons of algal biomass per hectare per year  in contrast to other methods  which focus primarily on a single high yielding species of algae  this method focuses on naturally occurring polycultures of algae  as such  the lipid content of the algae in an ats system is usually lower  which makes it more suitable for a fermented fuel product  such as ethanol  methane  or butanol  conversely  the harvested algae could be treated with a
process  which would make possible biodiesel  gasoline  and jet fuel production 
there are three major advantages of ats over other systems  the first advantage is documented higher productivity over open pond systems  the second is lower operating and fuel production costs  the third is the elimination of contamination issues due to the reliance on naturally occurring algae species  the projected costs for energy production in an ats system are  0.75 kg  compared to a photobioreactor which would cost  3.50 kg  furthermore  due to the fact that the primary purpose of ats is removing nutrients and pollutants out of water  and these costs have been shown to be lower than other methods of nutrient removal  this may incentivize the use of this technology for nutrient removal as the primary function  with biofuel production as an added benefit 
algae being harvested and dried from an ats system
fuel production  
after harvesting the algae  the biomass is typically processed in a series of steps  which can differ based on the species and desired product  this is an active area of research  and also is the bottleneck of this technology  the cost of extraction is higher than those obtained  one of the solutions is to use filter feeders to  eat  them  improved animals can provide both foods and fuels 
dehydration  
often  the algae is dehydrated  and then a solvent such as hexane is used to extract energy-rich compounds like
from the dried material  then  the extracted compounds can be processed into fuel using standard industrial procedures  for example  the extracted triglycerides are reacted with methanol to create biodiesel via   the unique composition of fatty acids of each species influences the quality of the resulting biodiesel and thus must be taken into account when selecting algal species for feedstock 
hydrothermal liquefaction  
an alternative approach called
employs a continuous process that subjects harvested wet algae to high temperatures and pressures350c  662f  and 3,000 pounds per square inch  21,000kpa  
products include crude oil  which can be further refined into aviation fuel  gasoline  or diesel fuel using one or many upgrading processes  the test process converted between 50 and 70 percent of the algaes carbon into fuel  other outputs include clean water  fuel gas and nutrients such as nitrogen  phosphorus  and potassium 
nutrients  
main article 
nutrients like
 n  
 p   and
 k   are important for plant growth and are essential parts of fertilizer 
and iron  as well as several trace elements  may also be considered important marine nutrients as the lack of one can limit the growth of  or productivity in  an area 
carbon dioxide  
bubbling co
2 through algal cultivation systems can greatly increase productivity and yield  up to a saturation point   typically  about 1.8 tonnes of
will be utilised per tonne of algal biomass  dry  produced  though this varies with algae species  the glenturret distillery in   uk  home to

2  scottish bioenergy  who run the project  sell the microalgae as high value  protein-rich food for   in the future  they will use the algae residues to produce renewable energy through  
nitrogen  
nitrogen is a valuable substrate that can be utilized in algal growth  various sources of nitrogen can be used as a nutrient for algae  with varying capacities  nitrate was found to be the preferred source of nitrogen  in regards to amount of biomass grown  urea is a readily available source that shows comparable results  making it an economical substitute for nitrogen source in large scale culturing of algae  despite the clear increase in growth in comparison to a nitrogen-less medium  it has been shown that alterations in nitrogen levels affect lipid content within the algal cells  in one study nitrogen deprivation for 72 hours caused the total fatty acid content  on a per cell basis  to increase by 2.4-fold  65  of the total fatty acids were esterified to triacylglycerides in oil bodies  when compared to the initial culture  indicating that the algal cells utilized de novo synthesis of fatty acids  it is vital for the lipid content in algal cells to be of high enough quantity  while maintaining adequate cell division times  so parameters that can maximize both are under investigation 
wastewater  
main article 
a possible nutrient source is
from the treatment of sewage  agricultural  or flood plain run-off  all currently major pollutants and health risks  however  this waste water cannot feed algae directly and must first be processed by bacteria  through   if waste water is not processed before it reaches the algae  it will contaminate the algae in the reactor  and at the very least  kill much of the desired algae strain  in
facilities  organic waste is often converted to a mixture of carbon dioxide    and organic fertilizer  organic fertilizer that comes out of the digester is liquid  and nearly suitable for algae growth  but it must first be cleaned and sterilized 
the utilization of wastewater and ocean water instead of freshwater is strongly advocated due to the continuing depletion of freshwater resources  however  heavy metals  trace metals  and other contaminants in wastewater can decrease the ability of cells to produce lipids biosynthetically and also impact various other workings in the machinery of cells  the same is true for ocean water  but the contaminants are found in different concentrations  thus  agricultural-grade fertilizer is the preferred source of nutrients  but heavy metals are again a problem  especially for strains of algae that are susceptible to these metals  in open pond systems the use of strains of algae that can deal with high concentrations of heavy metals could prevent other organisms from infesting these systems  in some instances it has even been shown that strains of algae can remove over 90  of nickel and zinc from industrial wastewater in relatively short periods of time 
environmental impact  
in comparison with terrestrial-based biofuel crops such as corn or soybeans  microalgal production results in a much less significant land footprint due to the higher oil productivity from the microalgae than all other oil crops  algae can also be grown on marginal lands useless for ordinary crops and with low conservation value  and can use water from salt aquifers that is not useful for agriculture or drinking  algae can also grow on the surface of the ocean in bags or floating screens  thus microalgae could provide a source of clean energy with little impact on the provisioning of adequate food and water or the conservation of biodiversity  algae cultivation also requires no external subsidies of insecticides or herbicides  removing any risk of generating associated pesticide waste streams  in addition  algal biofuels are much less toxic  and degrade far more readily than petroleum-based fuels  however  due to the flammable nature of any combustible fuel  there is potential for some environmental hazards if ignited or spilled  as may occur in a train derailment or a pipeline leak  this hazard is reduced compared to fossil fuels  due to the ability for algal biofuels to be produced in a much more localized manner  and due to the lower toxicity overall  but the hazard is still there nonetheless  therefore  algal biofuels should be treated in a similar manner to petroleum fuels in transportation and use  with sufficient safety measures in place at all times 
studies have determined that replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources  such as biofuels  have the capability of reducing co
2 emissions by up to 80   an algae-based system could capture approximately 80  of the co
2 emitted from a power plant when sunlight is available  although this co
2 will later be released into the atmosphere when the fuel is burned  this co
2 would have entered the atmosphere regardless  the possibility of reducing total co
2 emissions therefore lies in the prevention of the release of co
2 from fossil fuels  furthermore  compared to fuels like diesel and petroleum  and even compared to other sources of biofuels  the production and combustion of algal biofuel does not produce any sulfur oxides or nitrous oxides  and produces a reduced amount of carbon monoxide  unburned hydrocarbons  and reduced emission of other harmful pollutants  since terrestrial plant sources of biofuel production simply do not have the production capacity to meet current energy requirements  microalgae may be one of the only options to approach complete replacement of fossil fuels 
microalgae production also includes the ability to use saline waste or waste co
2 streams as an energy source  this opens a new strategy to produce biofuel in conjunction with waste water treatment  while being able to produce clean water as a byproduct  when used in a microalgal bioreactor  harvested microalgae will capture significant quantities of organic compounds as well as heavy metal contaminants absorbed from wastewater streams that would otherwise be directly discharged into surface and ground-water  moreover  this process also allows the recovery of phosphorus from waste  which is an essential but scarce element in nature  the reserves of which are estimated to have depleted in the last 50 years  another possibility is the use of algae production systems to clean up non-point source pollution  in a system known as an algal turf scrubber  ats   this has been demonstrated to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels in rivers and other large bodies of water affected by eutrophication  and systems are being built that will be capable of processing up to 110 million liters of water per day  ats can also be used for treating point source pollution  such as the waste water mentioned above  or in treating livestock effluent 
polycultures  
nearly all research in algal biofuels has focused on culturing single species  or monocultures  of microalgae  however  ecological theory and empirical studies have demonstrated that plant and algae polycultures  i e  groups of multiple species  tend to produce larger yields than monocultures  experiments have also shown that more diverse aquatic microbial communities tend to be more stable through time than less diverse communities  recent studies found that polycultures of microalgae produced significantly higher lipid yields than monocultures  polycultures also tend to be more resistant to pest and disease outbreaks  as well as invasion by other plants or algae  thus culturing microalgae in polyculture may not only increase yields and stability of yields of biofuel  but also reduce the environmental impact of an algal biofuel industry 
economic viability  
there is clearly a demand for sustainable biofuel production  but whether a particular biofuel will be used ultimately depends not on sustainability but cost efficiency  therefore  research is focusing on cutting the cost of algal biofuel production to the point where it can compete with conventional petroleum  the production of several products from algae has been mentioned   as the most important factor for making algae production economically viable  other factors are the improving of the solar energy to biomass conversion efficiency  currently 3   but 5 to 7  is theoretically attainable and making the oil extraction from the algae easier 
in a 2007 report a formula was derived estimating the cost of algal oil in order for it to be a viable substitute to petroleum diesel 
c algal oil    25.9  103 c petroleum 
where  c algal oil  is the price of microalgal oil in dollars per gallon and c petroleum  is the price of crude oil in dollars per barrel  this equation assumes that algal oil has roughly 80  of the caloric energy value of crude petroleum 
with current technology available  it is estimated that the cost of producing microalgal biomass is  2.95 kg for photobioreactors and  3.80 kg for open-ponds  these estimates assume that carbon dioxide is available at no cost  if the annual biomass production capacity is increased to 10,000 tonnes  the cost of production per kilogram reduces to roughly  0.47 and  0.60  respectively  assuming that the biomass contains 30  oil by weight  the cost of biomass for providing a liter of oil would be approximately  1.40   5.30 gal  and  1.81   6.85 gal  for photobioreactors and raceways  respectively  oil recovered from the lower cost biomass produced in photobioreactors is estimated to cost  2.80 l  assuming the recovery process contributes 50  to the cost of the final recovered oil  if existing algae projects can achieve biodiesel production price targets of less than  1 per gallon  the united states may realize its goal of replacing up to 20  of transport fuels by 2020 by using environmentally and economically sustainable fuels from algae production 
whereas technical problems  such as harvesting  are being addressed successfully by the industry  the high up-front investment of algae-to-biofuels facilities is seen by many as a major obstacle to the success of this technology  only few studies on the economic viability are publicly available  and must often rely on the little data  often only engineering estimates  available in the public domain  dmitrov examined the
and estimated that algae oil would only be competitive at an oil price of  800 per barrel  a study by alabi et al  examined raceways  photobioreactors and anaerobic fermenters to make biofuels from algae and found that photobioreactors are too expensive to make biofuels  raceways might be cost-effective in warm climates with very low labor costs  and fermenters may become cost-effective subsequent to significant process improvements  the group found that capital cost  labor cost and operational costs  fertilizer  electricity  etc   by themselves are too high for algae biofuels to be cost-competitive with conventional fuels  similar results were found by others  suggesting that unless new  cheaper ways of harnessing algae for biofuels production are found  their great technical potential may never become economically accessible  recently 
demonstrated a new reaction and proposed a process for harvesting and extracting raw materials for biofuel and chemical production that requires a fraction of the energy of current methods  while extracting all cell constituents 
use of byproducts  
many of the byproducts produced in the processing of microalgae can be used in various applications  many of which have a longer history of production than algal biofuel  some of the products not used in the production of biofuel include natural dyes and pigments  antioxidants  and other high-value bio-active compounds  these chemicals and excess biomass have found numerous use in other industries  for example  the dyes and oils have found a place in cosmetics  commonly as thickening and water-binding agents  discoveries within the pharmaceutical industry include antibiotics and antifungals derived from microalgae  as well as natural health products  which have been growing in popularity over the past few decades  for instance
contains numerous polyunsaturated fats  omega 3 and 6   amino acids  and vitamins  as well as pigments that may be beneficial  such as beta-carotene and chlorophyll 
advantages  
ease of growth  
one of the main advantages that using microalgae as the feedstock when compared to more traditional crops is that it can be grown much more easily  algae can be grown in land that would not be considered suitable for the growth of the regularly used crops  in addition to this  wastewater that would normally hinder plant growth has been shown to be very effective in growing algae  because of this  algae can be grown without taking up arable land that would otherwise be used for producing food crops  and the better resources can be reserved for normal crop production  microalgae also require fewer resources to grow and little attention is needed  allowing the growth and cultivation of algae to be a very passive process 
impact on food  
many traditional feedstocks for biodiesel  such as corn and palm  are also used as feed for livestock on farms  as well as a valuable source of food for humans  because of this  using them as biofuel reduces the amount of food available for both  resulting in an increased cost for both the food and the fuel produced  using algae as a source of biodiesel can alleviate this problem in a number of ways  first  algae is not used as a primary food source for humans  meaning that it can be used solely for fuel and there would be little impact in the food industry  second  many of the waste-product extracts produced during the processing of algae for biofuel can be used as a sufficient animal feed  this is an effective way to minimize waste and a much cheaper alternative to the more traditional corn- or grain-based feeds 
minimization of waste  
growing algae as a source of biofuel has also been shown to have numerous environmental benefits  and has presented itself as a much more environmentally friendly alternative to current biofuels  for one  it is able to utilize run-off  water contaminated with fertilizers and other nutrients that are a by-product of farming  as its primary source of water and nutrients  because of this  it prevents this contaminated water from mixing with the lakes and rivers that currently supply our drinking water  in addition to this  the ammonia  nitrates  and phosphates that would normally render the water unsafe actually serve as excellent nutrients for the algae  meaning that fewer resources are needed to grow the algae  many algae species used in biodiesel production are excellent bio-fixers  meaning they are able to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to use as a form of energy for themselves  because of this  they have found use in industry as a way to treat flue gases and reduce ghg emissions 
disadvantages  
commercial viability  
algae biodiesel is still a fairly new technology  despite the fact that research began over 30 years ago  it was put on hold during the mid-1990s  mainly due to a lack of funding and a relatively low petroleum cost  for the next few years algae biofuels saw little attention  it was not until the gas peak of the early 2000s that it eventually had a revitalization in the search for alternative fuel sources  while the technology exists to harvest and convert algae into a usable source of biodiesel  it still hasn t been implemented into a large enough scale to support the current energy needs  further research will be required to make the production of algae biofuels more efficient  and at this point it is currently being held back by lobbyists in support of alternative biofuels  like those produced from corn and grain  in 2013

said that after originally committing to spending up to  600 million on development in a joint venture with s   algae is  probably further  than  25 years away  from commercial viability  although
and
already began small-scale commercial sales in 2012 and 2013  respectively 
stability  
the biodiesel produced from the processing of microalgae differs from other forms of biodiesel in the content of polyunsaturated fats  polyunsaturated fats are known for their ability to retain fluidity at lower temperatures  while this may seem like an advantage in production during the colder temperatures of the winter  the polyunsaturated fats result in lower stability during regular seasonal temperatures

and
to construct a demonstration-scale algal biorefinery at an oil sands site near bonnyville  alberta 
in halifax  nova scotia  canada has found a new strain of algae that appears capable of producing oil at a rate 60 times greater than other types of algae being used for the generation of biofuels 
vg energy  a subsidiary of viral genetics incorporated  claims to have discovered a new method of increasing algal lipid production by disrupting the metabolic pathways that would otherwise divert photosynthetic energy towards carbohydrate production  using these techniques  the company states that lipid production could be increased several-fold  potentially making algal biofuels cost-competitive with existing fossil fuels 
algae production from the warm water discharge of a nuclear power plant has been piloted by patrick c  kangas at   owned by
corporation  this process takes advantage of the relatively high temperature water to sustain algae growth even during winter months 
companies such as sapphire energy and bio solar cells are using genetic engineering to make algae fuel production more efficient  according to klein lankhorst of bio solar cells  genetic engineering could vastly improve algae fuel efficiency as algae can be modified to only build short carbon chains instead of long chains of carbohydrates  sapphire energy also uses chemically induced mutations to produce algae suitable for use as a crop 
some commercial interests into large-scale algal-cultivation systems are looking to tie in to existing infrastructures  such as cement factories  coal power plants  or sewage treatment facilities  this approach changes wastes into resources to provide the raw materials  co

as well as essential oils  making it a viable source of
for biodiesel production 
the enzyme
is vital in starch production  but has no connection to lipid synthesis  removal of this enzyme resulted in the sta6 mutant  which showed increased lipid content  after 18 hours of growth in nitrogen deficient medium the sta6 mutants had on average 17ng triacylglycerides 1000 cells  compared to 10ng 1000 cells in wt cells  this increase in lipid production was attributed to reallocation of intracellular resources  as the algae diverted energy from starch production 
in 2013 researchers used a  knock-down  of fat-reducing enzymes  multifunctional lipase phospholipase acyltransferase  to increase lipids  oils  without compromising growth  the study also introduced an efficient screening process  antisense-expressing knockdown strains 1a6 and 1b1 contained 2.4- and 3.3-fold higher lipid content during exponential growth  and 4.1- and 3.2-fold higher lipid content after 40 h of silicon starvation 
funding programs  
numerous funding programs have been created with aims of promoting the use of renewable energy  in canada  the ecoagriculture biofuels capital initiative  ecoabc  provides  25 million per project to assist farmers in constructing and expanding a renewable fuel production facility  the program has  186 million set aside for these projects  the sustainable development  sdtc  program has also applied  500 millions over 8 years to assist with the construction of next-generation renewable fuels  in addition  over the last 2 years  10 million has been made available for renewable fuel research and analysis
in europe  the seventh framework programme  fp7  is the main instrument for funding research  similarly  the ner 300 is an unofficial  independent portal dedicated to renewable energy and grid integration projects  another program includes the horizon 2020 program which will start 1 january  and will bring together the framework program and other ec innovation and research funding into a new integrated funding system
the american  s
is addressing production of algae on the horizon to expand available material for biodiesel in a sustainable manner 
international policies  
canada  
numerous policies have been put in place since the 1975 oil crisis in order to promote the use of renewable fuels in the united states  canada and europe  in canada  these included the implementation of excise taxes exempting propane and natural gas which was extended to ethanol made from biomass and methanol in 1992  the federal government also announced their renewable fuels strategy in 2006 which proposed four components  increasing availability of renewable fuels through regulation  supporting the expansion of canadian production of renewable fuels  assisting farmers to seize new opportunities in this sector and accelerating the commercialization of new technologies  these mandates were quickly followed by the canadian provinces 
bc introduced a 5  ethanol and 5  renewable diesel requirement which was effective by january 2010  it also introduced a low carbon fuel requirement for 2012 to 2020 
alberta introduced a 5  ethanol and 2  renewable diesel requirement implemented april 2011  the province also introduced a minimum 25  ghg emission reduction requirement for qualifying renewable fuels 
saskatchewan implemented a 2  renewable diesel requirement in 2009 
additionally  in 2006  the canadian federal government announced its commitment to using its purchasing power to encourage the biofuel industry  section three of the 2006 alternative fuels act stated that when it is economically feasible to do so-75  per cent of all federal bodies and crown corporation will be motor vehicles 
the
has established research on algal carbon conversion as one of its flagship programs  as part of this program  the nrc made an announcement in may 2013 that they are partnering with canadian natural resources limited and pond biofuels to construct a demonstration-scale algal biorefinery near bonnyville  alberta 
united states  
policies in the united states have included a decrease in the subsidies provided by the federal and state governments to the oil industry which have usually included  2.84 billion  this is more than what is actually set aside for the biofuel industry  the measure was discussed at the g20 in pittsburgh where leaders agreed that  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption  reduce our energy security  impede investment in clean sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change   if this commitment is followed through and subsidies are removed  a fairer market in which algae biofuels can compete will be created  in 2010  the u s  house of representatives passed a legislation seeking to give algae-based biofuels parity with cellulose biofuels in federal tax credit programs  the algae-based renewable fuel promotion act  hr 4168  was implemented to give biofuel projects access to a  1.01 per gal production tax credit and 50  bonus depreciation for biofuel plant property  the u s government also introduced the domestic fuel for enhancing national security act implemented in 2011  this policy constitutes an amendment to the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 and federal defense provisions in order to extend to 15 the number of years that the department of defense  dod  multiyear contract may be entered into the case of the purchase of advanced biofuel  federal and dod programs are usually limited to a 5-year period

with algal biofuel being a relatively new alternative to conventional petroleum products  it leaves numerous opportunities for drastic advances in all aspects of the technology  producing algae biofuel is not yet a cost-effective replacement for gasoline  but alterations to current methodologies can change this  the two most common targets for advancements are the growth medium  open pond vs  photobioreactor  and methods to remove the intracellular components of the algae  below are companies that are currently innovating algal biofuel technologies 
algenol biofuels  
founded in 2006  algenol biofuels is a global  industrial biotechnology company that is commercializing its patented algae technology for production of ethanol and other fuels  based in southwest florida  algenols patented technology enables the production of the four most important fuels  ethanol  gasoline  jet  and diesel fuel  using proprietary algae  sunlight  carbon dioxide and saltwater for around  1.27 per gallon and at production levels of 8,000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year  algenol s technology produces high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production using carbon dioxide from industrial sources 
blue marble production  
blue marble production is a seattle-based company that is dedicated to removing algae from algae-infested water  this in turn cleans up the environment and allows this company to produce biofuel  rather than just focusing on the mass production of algae  this company focuses on what to do with the byproducts  this company recycles almost 100  of its water via reverse osmosis  saving about 26,000 gallons of water every month  this water is then pumped back into their system  the gas produced as a byproduct of algae will also be recycled by being placed into a photobioreactor system that holds multiple strains of algae  whatever gas remains is then made into pyrolysis oil by thermochemical processes  not only does this company seek to produce biofuel  but it also wishes to use algae for a variety of other purposes such as fertilizer  food flavoring  anti-inflammatory  and anti-cancer drugs 
solazyme  
solazyme is one of a handful of companies which is supported by oil companies such as chevron  additionally  this company is also backed by imperium renewables  blue crest capital finance  and the roda group  solazyme has developed a way to use up to 80  percent of dry algae as oil  this process requires the algae to grow in a dark fermentation vessel and be fed by carbon substrates within their growth media  the effect is the production of triglycerides that are almost identical to vegetable oil  solazyme s production method is said to produce more oil than those algae cultivated photosynthetically or made to produce ethanol  oil refineries can then take this algal oil and turn it into biodiesel  renewable diesel or jet fuels 
part of solazyme s testing  in collaboration with maersk line and the us navy  placed 30 tons of soladiesel rd  algae fuel into the 98,000-tonne  300-meter container ship maersk kalmar  this fuel was used at blends from 7  to 100  in an auxiliary engine on a month-long trip from bremerhaven  germany to pipavav  india in dec 2011  in jul 2012  the us navy used 700,000 gallons of hrd76 biodiesel in three ships of the uss nimitz  green strike group  during the 2012 rimpac exercise in hawaii  the nimitz also used 200,000 gallons of hrj5 jet biofuel  the 50/50 biofuel blends were provided by solazyme and dynamic fuels 
sapphire energy  
is a leader in the algal biofuel industry backed by the wellcome trust  bill gates  cascade investment  monsanto  and other large donors  after experimenting with production of various algae fuels beginning in 2007  the company now focuses on producing what it calls  green crude  from algae in open raceway ponds  after receiving more than  100 million in federal funds in 2012  sapphire built the first commercial demonstration algae fuel facility in new mexico and has continuously produced biofuel since completion of the facility in that year  in 2013  sapphire began commercial sales of algal biofuel to   making it one of the first companies  along with solazyme  to sell algae fuel on the market 
diversified technologies inc   
diversified technologies inc  has created a patent pending pre-treatment option to reduce costs of oil extraction from algae  this technology  called pulsed electric field  pef  technology  is a low cost  low energy process that applies high voltage electric pulses to a slurry of algae  the electric pulses enable the algal cell walls to be ruptured easily  increasing the availability of all cell contents  lipids  proteins and carbohydrates   allowing the separation into specific components downstream  this alternative method to intracellular extraction has shown the capability to be both integrated in-line as well as scalable into high yield assemblies  the pulse electric field subjects the algae to short  intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation in a treatment chamber  electroporating the cell walls  the formation of holes in the cell wall allows the contents within to flow into the surrounding solution for further separation  pef technology only requires 1-10 microsecond pulses  enabling a high-throughput approach to algal extraction 
preliminary calculations have shown that utilization of pef technology would only account for  0.10 per gallon of algae derived biofuel produced  in comparison  conventional drying and solvent-based extractions account for  1.75 per gallon  this inconsistency between costs can be attributed to the fact that algal drying generally accounts for 75  of the extraction process  although a relatively new technology  pef has been successfully used in both food decomtamination processes as well as waste water treatments 
origin oils inc   
origin oils inc  has been researching a revolutionary method called the helix bioreactor  altering the common closed-loop growth system  this system utilizes low energy lights in a helical pattern  enabling each algal cell to obtain the required amount of light  sunlight can only penetrate a few inches through algal cells  making light a limiting reagent in open-pond algae farms  each lighting element in the bioreactor is specially altered to emit specific wavelengths of light  as a full spectrum of light is not beneficial to algae growth  in fact  ultraviolet irradiation is actually detrimental as it inhibits photosynthesis  photoreduction  and the 520nm light-dark absorbance change of algae 
this bioreactor also addresses another key issue in algal cell growth  introducing co2 and nutrients to the algae without disrupting or over-aerating the algae  origin oils inc  combats this issues through the creation of their quantum fracturing technology  this process takes the co2 and other nutrients  fractures them at extremely high pressures and then deliver the micron sized bubbles to the algae  this allows the nutrients to be delivered at a much lower pressure  maintaining the integrity of the cells 
proviron  
proviron has been working on a new type of reactor  using flat plates  which reduces the cost of algae cultivation  at
similar research is being conducted using 4 grow systems  1 open pond system and 3 types of closed systems   according to ren wijffels the current systems do not yet allow algae fuel to be produced competitively  however using new  closed  systems  and by scaling up the production it would be possible to reduce costs by 10x  up to a price of 0,4  per kg of algae 
genifuels  
genifuel corporation has licensed the high temperature pressure fuel extraction process and has been working with the team at the lab since 2008  the company intends to team with some industrial partners to create a pilot plant using this process to make biofuel in industrial quantities  genifuel process combines hydrothermal liquefaction with catalytic hydrothermal gasification in reactor running at 350 celsius  662 fahrenheit  and pressure of 3000 psi 
baya biofuel  
the qmab started to mobilize its 100 hectares micro algae cultivation farm in qeshm island free zone  development of the farm mainly focuses on 2 phases  production of nutraceutical products and green crude oil to produce biofuel  main product of microalgae culture is crude oil  which can be fractioned into the same kinds of fuels and chemical compounds
