development of competition in the uk market  
the liberalisation and
of the energy markets in the united kingdom began with the
government in the 1980s  often called the thatcher-lawson agenda  due to the key role of
in the thatcher government cabinet   aspects of the ofgem model have been adopted by
legislation 
starting in the 1990s  the supply of electricity and gas to end consumers in the uk has been unbundled from the rest of the industry  at the time of privatisation  british gas and one regional
 pes  held a
on supplying all domestic gas and electricity consumers respectively in great britain  between 1996 and 1999  domestic energy consumers gradually got the freedom to choose their supplier  and finally in may 1998  the domestic gas market was fully opened to competition  closely followed by the domestic
in may 1999 
before there was competition on domestic markets  ofgem set
fixing maximum price that the monopoly suppliers could charge domestic customers  these price controls remained in place when markets started to get liberalised  and were then gradually removed between 2000 and 2002  ofgems decision to remove price controls was based on the assessment that competition was developing well at that time and that the competition act 1998  being effective since march 2000  would deter companies from the abuse of market power  and provide ofgem with sufficient power to tackle any abuse  moreover  consumer surveys showed good awareness of the ability to switch  high and rising switching rates away from the former monopoly supplies  and substantial and continuing falls in their market shares 
in 2000  the social action strategy review group was established and the competition act came into force  in 2003 the wholesale gas probe was published  two years after the removal of the last price controls  in april 2004  ofgem published a major review of the state of competition in the domestic energy supply markets  concluding that supply competition had delivered substantial benefits for all consumers and that the markets were competitive  though not yet mature  in 2005 there was the eu energy sector enquiry  as well as the supply licence review  the energy supply ombudsman was then established in 2006 and in 2008 the energy supply probe was published 
against the background of unprecedented increases in world
leading to record increases in wholesale and retail gas and electricity prices so that a typical household s energy bills more than doubled since early 2004 ofgem undertook the energy supply probe  the numbers of consumers in debt to their energy suppliers  average debt levels and disconnection rates were all rising  these energy price rises came at a time when household budgets were under pressure from the rising cost of food  petrol  mortgages and other essentials  vulnerable consumers and those in fuel poverty were particularly affected  the energy supply probe published the findings on the operation of the uk retail energy markets and set out a package of measures to tackle the issues raised 
cma investigation  
in june 2014 ofgem announced a
 cma  investigation into the trading practices and competitiveness of the country s major energy companies         
and   the investigation  which took two years  followed a referral by ofgem to the competition regulator   there is near-unanimous support for a referral and the cma investigation offers an important opportunity to clear the air  this will help rebuild consumer trust and confidence in the energy market as well as provide the certainty investors have called for   ofgem ceo dermot nolan in announcing the investigation  in august 2016 ofgem said that it would implement the cma s recommendation that suppliers should be required to provide the details of customers who have been on expensive tariffs for three years or more to rival suppliers  ofgem also said that it would impose an interim price cap on customers using pre-payment meters
