as an industry  
personal development as an
has several business relationship formats of operating  the main ways are
and   however  there are two newer ways increasing in prevalence 
and  
business-to-consumer market  
the business-to-consumer market involves selling books  courses and techniques to individuals  such as 
newly invented offerings such as 
traditional practices such as 
some programs are delivered online and many include
sold with a program  such as motivational books for self-help  recipes for weight-loss or technical manuals for yoga and martial-arts programs

books

individual
business-to-business market  
the business-to-business market also involves programs
in this case ones sold to companies and to governments to assess potential  to improve   to
or to prepare some entity for a new role in an organization  the goals of these programs are defined   with the institution or by the institution and the results are assessed      with the acceptance of personal development as a legitimate field in higher education    universities and
also contract programs to external specialist firms or to individuals   
a partial list of business-to-business programs might include 
and
courses and assessment systems for higher education organizations for their students
to employees in organizations through 
training
programs
some
specialize in personal development but as of 2009 generalist firms operating in the fields of human resources  recruitment and organizational strategy have entered what they perceive as a growing market  not to mention smaller firms and self-employed professionals who provide consulting  training and coaching 
additionally  the international association personal development professionals  an international trade group launched in 2013 to support professionals in the self-help industry   
origins  
major religions  such as the
and
 as well as
philosophies have used practices such as              
and   these practices have various functions  such as health or aesthetic satisfaction  but they may also link   to  final goals  of personal development such as discovering the
or living

in yoga  a discipline originating in   possibly over 3000 years ago  personal-development techniques include meditation  rhythmic breathing  stretching and postures 
and
utilise traditional chinese techniques  including breathing and
exercises      as well as practices linked to   such as dieting  massage and  
in islam  which arose almost 1500 years ago in the middle east  personal-development techniques include   recitation of the    
and
 purification of the soul    
two individual ancient philosophers  aristotle and the western tradition and confucius and the eastern tradition stand out as major sources of what has become personal development in the 21st century  representing a western tradition and an east asian tradition  elsewhere anonymous founders of schools of self-development appear endemic  note the traditions of the indian sub-continent in this regard 
south asian traditions

some ancient indians aspired to  beingness  wisdom and happiness  
aristotle and the western tradition  
the greek philosopher
 384 bce  322 bce  influenced theories   of personal development in the west  in his   aristotle defined personal development as a category of
or practical wisdom  where the practice of virtues  arte  leads to   commonly translated as  happiness  but more accurately understood as  human flourishing  or  living well   aristotle continues to influence the western concept of personal development to this day  particularly in the
and in  
confucius and the east asian tradition  
in chinese tradition 
 around 551 bce  479 bce  founded an ongoing philosophy  his ideas continue to influence   education and
in china and east asia  in his
confucius wrote 
the ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom  first ordered well their own states  wishing to order well their states  they first regulated their families  wishing to regulate their families  they first cultivated their persons  wishing to cultivate their persons  they first rectified their hearts  wishing to rectify their hearts  they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts  wishing to be sincere in their thoughts  they first extended to the utmost their knowledge  such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things 
contexts  
psychology  
became linked to personal development starting   with
 18701937  and
 18751961  
adler refused to limit psychology to analysis  making the important point that aspirations look forward and do not limit themselves to unconscious drives or to childhood experiences  he also originated the concepts of
 1929he defined  lifestyle  as an individual s characteristic approach to life  in facing problems  and of     a concept that influenced management under the heading of    
carl gustav jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of   which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the  
 19201994  developed jung s early concept of    and included a sociological perspective  levinson proposed that personal development come under the influencethroughout of aspirations  which he called  the dream  
whatever the nature of his dream  a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out  it makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the dream  or opposed to it  if the dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die  and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose 
levinson s model of seven life-stages has been considerably modified   due to sociological changes   in the  
research on success in reaching goals  as undertaken by
 born 1925   suggested that
best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results  according to bandura
functions as a powerful predictor of success because 
it makes you expect to succeed
it allows you take risks and set challenging goals
it helps you keep trying if at first you don t succeed
it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough
in 1998
won election to a one-year term as president of the
and proposed a new focus  on healthy individuals   rather than on pathology  he created the    current 
we have discovered that there is a set of human strengths that are the most likely buffers against mental illness  courage  optimism  interpersonal skill  work ethic  hope  honesty and perseverance  much of the task of prevention will be to create a science of human strength whose mission will be to foster these virtues in young people 
higher education  
personal development has been at the heart of education in the west   in the form of the greek philosophers    and in the east   with confucius  some people   emphasize personal development as a part of higher education    who founded the university of berlin  since 1949    in 1810  made a statement interpretable   as referring to personal development   if there is one thing more than another which absolutely requires free activity on the part of the individual  it is precisely education  whose object it is to develop the individual 
during the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on american campuses led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students

in the uk  personal development took a central place in university policy   in 1997 when the
declared that universities should go beyond academic teaching to provide students with personal development    in 2001 a quality assessment agency for uk universities produced guidelines for universities to enhance personal development as 
  a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning  performance and   or achievement and to plan for their personal  educational and career development 
  objectives related explicitly to student development  to improve the capacity of students to understand what and how they are learning  and to review  plan and take responsibility for their own learning
in the 1990s 
began to set up specific personal-development programs for
and
orientation and in 1998 the
set up the
accreditation system which specified that personal development must form part of the learning process through internships  working on team projects and going abroad for work or exchange programs   
the first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a partnership between metizo  a personal-development consulting firm  and the euromed management school in marseilles  students must not only complete assignments but also demonstrate self-awareness and achievement of personal-development competencies 
as an academic department personal development has become   a specific discipline  usually associated with   as an area of research  personal development draws on links to other academic disciplines 
for questions of learning and assessment
for motivation and personality
for identity and social networks
for human capital and economic value
for ethics and self-reflection
the workplace  
 19081970   proposed a
with
at the top  defined as 
 the desire to become more and more what one is  to become everything that one is capable of becoming 
since maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people he estimated one percenthis hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard self-actualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid  while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employees   
as organizations and labor markets became more global 
for development shifted from the company to the individual    in 1999 management thinker
wrote in the  
we live in an age of unprecedented opportunity  if you ve got ambition and smarts  you can rise to the top of your chosen profession  regardless of where you started out  but with opportunity comes responsibility  companies today aren t managing their employees  careers 
must  effectively  be their own chief executive officers  it s up to you to carve out your place  to know when to change course  and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years 
management professors
of the london business school and
of the harvard business school wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract  on the one hand the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value   market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative  creativity and skills of all employees  
on the other hand  employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and      embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development  
the 1997 publication of ghoshal s and bartlett s individualized corporation corresponded to a change in
from a system of predefined paths defined by companies  to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilities    another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that women s careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men  the 2007 study of women s careers by sylvia ann hewlett off-ramps and on-ramps had a major impact on the way companies view careers    further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by herminia ibarra in her working identity on the relationship with career change and identity change  indicating that priorities of
and lifestyle continually develop through life 
personal development programs in companies fall into two categories  the provision of
and the fostering of development strategies 
have the purpose of improving satisfaction  motivation and loyalty    employee surveys may help organizations find out personal-development needs  preferences and problems  and they use the results to design benefits programs    typical programs in this category include 
programs
many such programs resemble programs that some employees might conceivably pay for themselves outside work  yoga  sports  martial arts  money-management  positive psychology    etc   
as an investment  personal development programs have the goal of increasing
or improving   innovation or quality  proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organization s strategic development goals  employees gain access to these investment-oriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee  usually defined in a
architecture including populations such as new hires  perceived high-potential employees  perceived key employees  sales staff  research staff and perceived future     organizations may also offer other  non-investment-oriented  programs to many or even all employees  typical programs   focus on career-development    teamwork  and competency-development  personal development also forms an element in
tools such as   assessing one s level of ability using a
grid  or getting feedback from a
filled in by colleagues at different levels in the organization 
criticism  
scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect  in 2005 
portrayed the american self-help movementhe uses the acronym sham  the self-help and
movementnot only as ineffective in achieving its goals  but also as    salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back whether the program worked for them or not     others similarly point out that with self-help books  supply increases the demand   the more people read them  the more they think they need them   more like an
than an alliance     self-help writers have been described as working  in the area of the   the   the narrativized    although a veneer of
permeates the ir  work  there is also an underlying armature of
