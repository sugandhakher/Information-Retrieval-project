 particularly     and      and   most if not all existing
will need to be retired  the
of germany s fleet of   to be complete by 2022  is a key part of the program 
legislative support for the energiewende was passed in late 2010 and includes
 ghg  reductions of 8095  by 2050  relative to 1990  and a
target of 60  by 2050  these targets are ambitious  one berlin
noted that  while the german approach is not unique worldwide  the speed and scope of the energiewende are exceptional   the energiewende also seeks a greater transparency in relation to national
formation 
germany has made significant progress on its ghg emissions reduction target  achieving a 27  decrease between 1990 and 2014  however germany will need to maintain an average ghg emissions abatement rate of 3.5  per annum to reach its energiewende goal  equal to the maximum historical value thus far 
germany spends 1.5billion per annum on energy research  2013 figure  in an effort to solve the technical and social issues raised by the transition  this includes a number of computer studies that have confirmed the feasibility and a similar cost  relative to

the term energiewende  
the main renewable energy sources in germany      and
the term energiewende was first contained in the title of a 1980 publication by the german   calling for the complete abandonment of nuclear and petroleum energy  223 on 16 february 1980  the german federal ministry of the environment also hosted a symposium in berlin  called energiewende  atomausstieg und klimaschutz  energy transition  nuclear phase-out and climate protection   the views of the ko-institut  initially strongly opposed  have gradually become common knowledge in energy policy  in the following decades  the term expanded in scope  in its present form it dates back to at least 2002 
energiewende designates a significant change in   the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation  for example  producing heat and power in small cogeneration units   which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency 
in a broader sense  this transition also entails a
of energy  in the traditional energy industry  a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power  renewable energies  in contrast  can  as a rule  be established in a decentralized manner  public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production  photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals  municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially  while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders  also significant  the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region  renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy  and local governments often promote them 
status  
the key policy document outlining the energiewende was published by the german government in september 2010  some six months before the   legislative support was passed in september 2010  on 6 june 2011  following fukushima  the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy  after the 2013 federal elections  the new   and
coalition government continued the energiewende  with only minor modification of its goals in the coalition agreement  an intermediate target was introduced of a 5560  share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption in 2035  important aspects include  as of november 2016

these targets go well beyond
legislation and the national policies of other european states  the policy objectives have been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables  particularly wind power  germany s share of renewables has increased from around 5  in 1999 to 22.9  in 2012  surpassing the oecd average of 18  usage of renewables  producers have been guaranteed a fixed
for 20 years  guaranteeing a fixed income  energy co-operatives have been created  and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits  the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market  however  in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low   and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality  nuclear power plants were closed  and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned  in 2022 
one factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market  it is believed 8,300km of power lines must be built or upgraded  the different
have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines  industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers  who have had rising electricity bills  germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe  in comparison  their nuclear-reliant neighbour france has some of the cheapest in the eu   7 out of 27  
acceptance of power plants in the neighborhood  germany 2014 
according to a 2014 survey conducted by tns emnid for the german renewable energies agency among 1015 respondents  94 per cent of the germans support the enforced expansion of renewable energies  more than two-thirds of the interviewees agree to renewable power plants close to their homes  the share of total final energy from renewables was 11  in 2014  137
on 1 august 2014  a revised
entered into force  specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates    will no longer be fixed by the government  but will be determined by auction 
market redesign is a key part of the energiewende  the german electricity market needs to be reworked to suit  among other things  wind and pv cannot be principally refinanced under the current
based market  carbon pricing is also central to the energiewende and the
 eu ets  needs to be reformed to create a genuine
of certificates  the german federal government is calling for such reform  most of the computer scenarios used to analyse the energiewende rely on a substantial carbon price to drive the transition to low-carbon technologies 
coal-fired generation needs to be retired as part of the energiewende  some argue for an explicit negotiated phase-out of coal plants  along the lines of the well-publicized nuclear phase-out  coal comprised 42  of electricity generation in 2015  if germany is to limit its contribution to a
to 1.5c above pre-industrial levels  as declared in the 2015   a complete phase-out of fossil fuels together with a shift to
is required by about 2040 
the energiewende is made up of various technical building blocks    while too expensive at present  may become a useful technology in the future 
has a key but currently under-recognised role to play  improved energy efficiency is one of germany s official targets  greater integration with adjoining national
can offer mutual benefits  indeed  systems with high shares of renewables can utilize geographical diversity to offset intermittency 
germany invested 1.5billion in energy research in 2013  of that the german federal government spent 820million supporting projects ranging from basic research to applications  the federal government also foresees an export role for german expertise in the area 
the social and political dimensions of the energiewende have been subject to study  strunz argues that the underlying technological  political and economic structures will need to change radically  a process he calls regime shift  schmid  knopf  and pechan analyse the actors and institutions that will be decisive in the energiewende and how latency in the national electricity
may restrict progress 
on 3 december 2014  the german federal government released its national action plan on energy efficiency  nape  in order to improve the uptake of energy efficiency  the areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings  energy conservation for companies  consumer energy efficiency  and transport energy efficiency  german industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution 
an official federal government report on progress under the energiewende  updated for 2014  notes that 
energy consumption fell by 4.7  in 2014  from 2013  and at 700413132000000000013132petajoules reached it lowest level since 1990
renewable generation is the number-one source of electricity
energy efficiency increased by an average annual 1.6  between 2008 and 2014
final energy consumption in the transport sector was 1.7  higher in 2014 than in 2005
for the first time in more than ten years  electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of 2015
a commentary on the progress report expands on many of the issues raised 
slow progress on transmission network reinforcement has led to a deferment of new windfarms in northern germany  the german cabinet earlier approved costly underground cabling in october 2015 in a bid to dispel local resistance against above-ground pylons and to speed up the expansion process 
analysis by
in late-2016 suggests that germany will probably miss several of its key energiewende targets  despite recent reforms to the
and the wholesale electricity market  the goal to cut emissions by 40  by 2020  will most likely be missed    if no further measures are taken  and the 5560  share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2035 is  unachievable  with the current plans for renewables expansion 
citizen support and participation  
as of 2016  citizen support for the energiewende remains high  with recent surveys indicating that about 8090  of the public are in favor  one reason for the high acceptance is the substantial participation of german citizens in the energiewende  as private households  land owners  or members of energy cooperatives  genossenschaft   a 2016 survey showed that roughly one in two germans would consider investing in community renewable energy projects  manfred fischedick  director of the
has commented that  if people participate with their own money  for example in a wind or solar power plant in their area  they will also support  the energiewende    a 2010 study shows the benefits to
of community ownership of renewable generation in their locality 
estimates for 2012 suggest that almost half the renewable energy capacity in germany is owned by citizens through energy cooperatives and private initiatives  more specifically  citizens account for nearly half of all installed biogas and solar capacity and half of the installed onshore wind capacity 
changes in energy policy  starting with the
in 2014  may jeopardize the efforts of citizens to participate in the future 
computer studies  
much of the policy development for the energiewende is underpinned by   run mostly by universities and research institutes  the models are usually based on
and are used to investigate different assumptions regarding the stability  sustainability  cost  efficiency  and public acceptability of various sets of technologies  some models cover the entire   while others are confined to
and consumption 
several computer studies confirm the feasibility of the german electricity system being 100  renewable in 2050 
2009 wwf study  
in 2009
germany published a quantitative study prepared by the   prognos  and hans-joachim ziesing  the study presumes a 95  reduction in
by the year 2050 and covers all sectors  the study shows that the transformation from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy is possible and affordable  it notes that by committing to this transformation path  germany could become a model for other countries 
2015 deep decarbonization pathways project study  
the
 ddpp  aims to demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems by 2050 in order to achieve a   the 2015 german country report  produced in association with the   examines the official target of reducing domestic ghg emissions by 80  to 95  by 2050  compared with 1990   decarbonization pathways for germany are illustrated by means of three ambitious scenarios with energy-related emission reductions between 1990 and 2050 varying between 80  and more than 90   three strategies strongly contribute to ghg emission reduction 
energy efficiency improvements  in all sectors but especially in buildings 
increased use of domestic renewables  with a focus on electricity generation 
electrification and  in two of the scenarios also  use of renewable electricity-based synthetic fuels  especially in the transport and industry sector 
in addition  some scenarios use controversially 
final energy demand reductions through behavioral changes  modal shift in transport  changes in eating and heating habits 
net imports of electricity from renewable sources or of
use of
 ccs  technology to reduce industry sector ghg emissions  including cement production 
potential co-benefits for germany include increased energy security  higher competitiveness of and global business opportunities for companies  job creation  stronger gdp growth  smaller energy bills for households  and less air pollution 
2015 fraunhofer ise study  
using the model remod-d  renewable energy model  germany   this 2015
study investigates several system transformation scenarios and their related costs  the guiding question of the study is  how can a cost-optimised transformation of the german energy system  with consideration of all
and consumer sectors  be achieved while meeting the declared
targets and ensuring a secure energy supply at all times 
 ccs  is explicitly excluded from the scenarios  a future energy scenario emitting 85  less co2 emissions than 1990 levels is compared with a reference scenario  which assumes that the german energy system operates in 2050 the same way as it does today  under this comparison  primary energy supply drops 42   the total cumulative costs depend on the future prices for carbon and oil  if the penalty for co2 emissions increases to 100 tonne by 2030 and thereafter remains constant and fossil fuel prices increase annually by 2   then the total cumulative costs of today s energy system are 8  higher than the costs required for the minus 85  scenario up to 2050  the report also notes 
from the macroeconomic perspective  the transformation of germany s energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow  moving the cash spent on energy imports today to spend it instead on new investments in systems  their operation and maintenance  in this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value  a factor which also does not appear in the shown cost analysis   p8 
2015 diw study  
a 2015 study uses dieter or dispatch and investment evaluation tool with endogenous renewables  developed by the
 diw   berlin  germany  the study examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60  to 100   under the baseline scenario of 80   the german government target for 2050  
requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost  nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves  storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables  but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options  particularly on biomass availability  the model is fully described in the study report 
2016 acatech study  
a 2016 -lead study focused on so-called flexibility technologies used to balance the fluctuations inherent in power generation from wind and photovoltaics  set in 2050  several scenarios use
to stabilise the backbone of energy system  ensuring supply security during several weeks of low wind and solar radiation  other scenarios investigate a 100  renewable system and show these to be possible but more costly  flexible consumption and storage control    in households and the industrial sector is the most cost-efficient means of balancing short-term power fluctuations  long-term storage systems  based on   are only viable if carbon emissions are to be reduced by more than 80   on the question of costs  the study notes 
assuming that the price of emissions allowances in 2050 will significantly surpass its current level  a power generation system boasting a high percentage of wind and photovoltaics will  as a rule  come cheaper than a system dominated by fossil fuel power plants  7
2016 stanford university study  
the atmosphere energy program at
has developed roadmaps for 139 countries to achieve energy systems powered only by wind  water  and sunlight  wws  by 2050  in the case of germany  total end-use energy drops from 375.8gw for
to 260.9gw under a fully renewable transition  load shares in 2050 would be  on-shore wind 35   off-shore wind 17   wave 0.08   geothermal 0.01   hydro-electric 0.87   tidal 0   residential pv 6.75   commercial pv 6.48   utility pv 33.8   and
0   the study also assess avoided air pollution  eliminated global climate change costs  and net job creation  these co-benefits are substantial 
criticisms  
the energiewende has not been without its critics  after introduction of the original
in 2000 there was a focus on long term costs  while in later years this has shifted to a focus on short term costs and the  financial burden  of the energiewende while ignoring environmental externalities of fossil fuels  nonetheless  for the first time in more than ten years  electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of 2015 
components of the german electricity price for households in 2016
the renewable energy levy to finance green power investment is added to germans  electricity unit price  the surcharge  22.1  in 2016   pays the state-guaranteed price for renewable energy to producers and is 6.35 cents per kwh in 2016 
german economy and energy minister
admitted  for a country like germany with a strong industrial base  exiting nuclear and coal-fired power generation at the same time would not be possible   germany s co2 emissions were escalating in 2012 and 2013 and it is planned to reopen some of the dirtiest brown coal mines that had previously been closed  coal generated electricity increased to 45  in 2013  the highest level since 2007  nonetheless  in 2014 carbon emissions had declined again  more renewable energy had been generated and a greater energy efficiency had been achieved  from 1999 to 2014 renewable energy production rose from 29 twh to 161 twh  while nuclear power fell from 180 to 97 twh and coal power production fell from 291 to 265 twh
