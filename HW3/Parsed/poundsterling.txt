names  
the full  official name  pound sterling     pounds sterling  is used mainly in formal contexts and also when it is necessary to distinguish the united kingdom currency from   otherwise the term pound is normally used  the currency name is sometimes abbreviated to just sterling  particularly in the wholesale financial markets  but not when referring to specific amounts  for example   payment is accepted in sterling  but never  these cost five sterling   the abbreviations  ster   or  stg   are sometimes used  the term  british pound  is commonly used in less formal contexts  although it is not an official name of the currency  the pound sterling is also referred to as  cable  amongst
traders  the origins of this term are attributed to the fact that in the 1800s  the dollar pound sterling exchange rate was transmitted via transatlantic cable  forex brokers are sometimes referred to as  cable dealers  
there is apparent convergence of opinion   regarding the origin of the term  pound sterling   toward its derivation from the name of a small norman silver coin  and away from its association with easterlings  germanic traders  or other etymologies  hence  the oxford english dictionary  and sources derived therefrom  state that the  most plausible  etymology is derivation from the old english steorra for  star  with the added
suffix  -ling   to mean  little star  and to refer to a
of the english normans  as another established source notes  the compound expression was then derived 
silver coins known as  sterlings  were issued in the saxon kingdoms  240 of them being minted from a pound of silver    hence  large payments came to be reckoned in  pounds of sterlings   a phrase later shortened   
encyclopdia britannica  entry  pound sterling 
however  the perceived narrow window of the issuance of this coin  and the fact that coin designs changed frequently in the period in question  led
to reject this in favour of a more complex theory 
another argument that the
was the origin for both the origin of its definition and manufacture  and in its name is that the german name for the baltic is  ost see   or  east sea   and from this the baltic merchants were called  osterlings   or  easterlings   in 1260  henry iii granted them a charter of protection  and because the league s money was not frequently debased like that of england  english traders stipulated to be paid in pounds of the  easterlings   which was contracted to   sterling   and land for their kontor  the steelyard of london  which by the 1340s was also called  easterlings hall   or esterlingeshalle

a common slang term for the pound sterling or pound is quid  which is singular and plural  except in the common phrase  quids in   the term may have come via italian immigrants from     the name for a number of coins used in italy until the 19th century  or from latin  quid  via the common phrase   literally   what for what   or  figuratively   an equal exchange or substitution

decimal coinage  
since
in 1971  see    the pound has been divided into 100 pence  until 1981 described on the coinage as  new pence    the symbol for the penny is  p   hence an amount such as 50p  0.50  properly pronounced  fifty pence  is more colloquially  quite often  pronounced  fifty pee   ffti  pi    this also helped to distinguish between new and old pence amounts during the changeover to the decimal system  a decimal

 formerly 
the pound was a unit of account in
england  equal to 240 silver
and equivalent to one
of silver  it evolved into the modern british   the pound sterling 
the accounting system of 4
  1   12 pence   1   20 shillings   1 pound was adopted from that introduced by
to the

the origins of sterling lie in the reign of king    757796  who introduced the   it copied the denarius of the new currency system of  s   as in the carolingian system  240 pennies weighed 1
 corresponding to charlemagne s libra   with the shilling corresponding to charlemagne s solidus and equal to 12d  at the time of the penny s introduction  it weighed 22.5 troy
of fine silver  32 tower grains  about 1.5 g   indicating that the mercian pound weighed 5,400 troy grains  the mercian pound became the basis of the   which weighed 5,400 troy grains  equivalent to 7,680 tower grains  about 350g   at this time  the name sterling had yet to be acquired  the penny swiftly spread throughout the other anglo-saxon kingdoms and became the standard coin of what was to become england   
medieval  
the early pennies were struck from fine silver  as pure as was available   however 
was introduced by king
 known as the   which was struck from 0.925  92.5   silver  this became the standard until the 20th century and is today known as   named after its association with the currency  sterling silver is harder than the 0.999  99.9  
that was traditionally used and so sterling silver coins did not wear down as rapidly as fine silver coins  the english currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344  when the gold
was successfully introduced into circulation  however  silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816 
during the time of   the pound sterling equaled the pound weight tower  in the 28th year of edward i  the tale pound  or pound sterling  first began to differ or come short of the pound weight tower  from which it drew its origin  and to which until now it was equal  for by indenture of that year the pound weight was to contain twenty shillings and three-pence in tale  14 in the 27th year of edward iii  the pound sterling was now but 4/5 of the pound weight  or 9 oz  12 dwts  tower  15by an act of 13 henry iv  the pound weight of standard silver was to contain thirty shillings in tale  or 1-1/2 pound sterling  therefore the pound sterling reduced to 2/3 of a pound weight  or 8 oz  tower  18 the pound sterling was adjusted in weight several more times thereafter 
in the reign of
 13991413   the penny was reduced in weight to 15 grains  0.97g  of silver  with a further reduction to 12 grains  0.78g  in 1464 
tudor  
during the reigns of
and   the silver coinage was drastically debased  although the pound was redefined to the
of 5,760 grains  373g  in 1526  in 1544  a silver coinage was issued containing just one third silver and two thirds copperequating to  333 silver  or 33.3  pure  the result was a coin copper in appearance  but relatively pale in colour  in 1552  a new silver coinage was introduced  struck in   however  the penny s weight was reduced to 8 grains  0.52g   meaning that 1 troy pound of sterling silver produced 60 shillings of coins  this silver standard was known as the  60-shilling standard  and lasted until 1601 when a  62-shilling standard  was introduced  reducing the penny s weight to 72331 grains  0.50g  
throughout this period  the size and value of the gold coinage fluctuated considerably 
unofficial gold standard  
in 1663  a new
was introduced based on the 22
fine   fixed in weight at 4412 to the
from 1670  this coin s value varied considerably until 1717  when it was fixed at 21 shillings  21 -  1.05 pounds   however  despite the efforts of sir   master of the   to reduce the guinea s value  this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver when compared to the valuations in other european countries    silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in  leading to a situation where great britain was effectively on a   aggravating this outflow was the fact that silver was the only commodity accepted by china for exporting goods during this period  from the mid-17th century  around 28 million kilograms  62 million pounds  of silver were received by china  principally from european powers  in exchange for chinese tea and other goods  in order to trade with china  great britain had to first trade with the other european nations to receive silver  which led to the
redressing this trade imbalance through the
of

domestic offtake further reduced silver in circulation as the improving fortunes of the merchant class led to increased demand for tablewares  silversmiths had always regarded coinage as a source of raw material  already government verified for fineness  as a result  sterling coins were being melted and fashioned into sterling silverware at an accelerating rate  a 1697 act of parliament attempted to stem this tide by raising the minimum acceptable fineness on wrought plate from sterling s 92.5  to a new
standard of 95.83   product then made solely from melted coins would be found wanting when the silversmith took his wares to the   thus discouraging the melting of coins

sterling circulated in much of the   in some parts  it was used alongside local currencies  for example  the gold sovereign was legal tender in canada despite the use of the   several colonies and dominions adopted the pound as their own currency  these included australia          the     new zealand  south africa and   some of these retained parity with sterling throughout their existence  e g  the    whilst others deviated from parity after the end of the gold standard  e g  the    these currencies and others tied to sterling constituted the

by the 19th century the pound sterling was widely accepted outside britain  the american

decimalisation  
main article 
until decimalisation  amounts were stated in pounds  shillings  and pence  with various widely understood notations  the same amount was denoted by 32s 6d  32/6  1 12s 6d  1/12/6  it was customary to specify some prices  for example professional fees and auction prices for works of art  in guineas  one guinea was 21 shillings  although
were no longer in use 
formal parliamentary proposals to decimalise sterling were first made in 1824 when sir john wrottesley  mp for staffordshire  asked in the british
whether consideration had been given to decimalising the currency  wrottesley raised the issue in the house of commons again in 1833  and it was again raised by   mp for kilmarnock burghs  in 1847 whose efforts led to the introduction in 1848 of what was in effect the first decimal coin in the united kingdom  the florin  valued at one-tenth of a pound sterling  however  full decimalisation was resisted  although the florin coin  re-designated as ten new pence  survived the transfer to a full decimal system in 1971  with examples surviving in british coinage until 1993 
j  b  smith  mp for   raised the issue of full decimalisation again in parliament in 1853  resulting in the chancellor of the exchequer    announcing soon afterwards that  the great question of a decimal coinage  was  now under serious consideration   a full proposal for the decimalisation of sterling was then tabled in the house of commons in june 1855  by william brown  mp for   with the suggestion that the pound sterling be divided into one thousand parts  each called a  mil   or alternatively a farthing  as the pound was then equivalent to 960 farthings which could easily be rounded up to one thousand farthings in the new system  this did not result in the conversion of the pound sterling into a decimal system  but it was agreed to establish a
to look into the issue  however  largely due to the hostility to decimalisation of two of the appointed commissioners 
 a banker  and
 governor of the bank of england   decimalisation in britain was effectively quashed for over a hundred years 
however the pound sterling was decimalised in various british colonial territories before the united kingdom  and in several cases using william brown s proposal that the pound be divided into 1000 parts  called mils  this included hong kong from 1863 to 1866  cyprus from 1955 until 1960  and continued on the island as the division of the
until 1983   and the palestine mandate from 1926 until 1948 
towards the end of the second world war  various attempts to decimalise the pound sterling in the united kingdom were made  until in 1966 the british government decided to include in the
a plan to convert the pound into a decimal currency  as a result of this  on 15 february 1971  the uk decimalised the pound sterling  replacing the shilling and penny with a single subdivision  the new penny  for example  a price tag of 1 12s 6d became 1.6212  the word  new  was omitted from coins minted after 1981 
free-floating pound

from august 1971 onwards  at first it appreciated a little  rising to almost  2.65 in march 1972 from  2.42  the upper bound of the band in which it had been fixed  the

were still being felt  with inflation rising to over 27  in 1975  financial markets were beginning to believe the pound was overvalued  and in april that year
advised the sale of sterling investments in the face of high taxes  in a story that ended with  goodbye  great britain  it was nice knowing you   at the time the uk government was running a budget deficit  and labour s strategy emphasised high public spending  callaghan was told there were three possible outcomes  a disastrous free fall in sterling  an internationally unacceptable siege economy  or a deal with key allies to prop up the pound while painful economic reforms were put in place  the us government feared the crisis could endanger nato and the
 eec   and in light of this the us treasury set out to force domestic policy changes  in november 1976 the
 imf  announced the conditions for a loan  including deep cuts in  
197989  
the conservative party was elected to office in 1979  on a programme of fiscal austerity  initially the pound rocketed  moving above us 2.40  as interest rates rose in response to the
policy of targeting   the high exchange rate was widely blamed for the deep
of 1981  sterling fell sharply after 1980  at its lowest  the pound stood at just  1.03 in march 1985  before rising to  1.70 in december 1989 
following the deutsche mark  
in 1988   s     decided that the pound should  shadow  the west german   with the unintended result of a rapid rise in inflation as the economy boomed due to inappropriately low interest rates   for ideological reasons  the conservative government declined to use alternative mechanisms to control the explosion of credit  for this reason  former prime minister
referred to lawson as a  one club golfer   
following
in 1990  the reverse held true  as high borrowing costs to fund eastern reconstruction  a need exacerbated by the political choice to make the ostmark equivalent to the deutsche mark  dm   meant rates in other countries shadowing the dm  especially the uk  were far too high relative to domestic circumstances  leading to a housing decline and recession 
following the european currency unit  
on 8 october 1990 the conservative government    decided to join the
 erm   with the pound set at 2.95  however  the country was forced to withdraw from the system on     16 september 1992  as britain s economic performance made the exchange rate unsustainable  speculator
infamously made approximately us 1 billion from
the pound 
 black wednesday  saw interest rates jump from 10  to 15  in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the pound from falling below the erm limits  the exchange rate fell to dm2.20  those who had argued for a lower gbp dm exchange rate were vindicated as the cheaper pound encouraged exports and contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1990s 
following inflation targets  
in 1997  the newly elected
government handed over day-to-day control of interest rates to the
 a policy that had originally been advocated by the    the bank is now responsible for setting its base rate of interest so as to keep inflation in the
 cpi  very close to 2   should cpi inflation be more than one percentage point above or below the target  the governor of the bank of england is required to write an open letter to the
explaining the reasons for this and the measures which will be taken to bring this measure of inflation back in line with the 2  target  on 17 april 2007  cpi inflation was reported at 3.1   inflation of the

the government of former prime minister

the idea of replacing the pound with the euro was always controversial with the british public  partly because of the pound s identity as a symbol of british sovereignty and because it would  according to many critics  have led to suboptimal interest rates  harming the british economy  in december 2008  the results of a bbc poll of 1000 people suggested that 71  would vote no to the euro  23  would vote yes to joining the european single currency  while 6  said they were unsure  the pound did not join the second european exchange rate mechanism  erm ii  after the euro was created

the pound and the euro fluctuate in value against one another  although there may be correlation between movements in their respective exchange rates with other currencies such as the us dollar  inflation concerns in the uk led the bank of england to raise interest rates in late 2006 and 2007  this caused the pound to appreciate against other major currencies and  with the us dollar depreciating at the same time  the pound hit a 15-year high against the us dollar on 18 april 2007  reaching us 2 the day before  for the first time since 1992  the pound and many other currencies continued to appreciate against the dollar  sterling hit a 26-year high of us 2.1161 on 7 november 2007 as the dollar fell worldwide  from mid-2003 to mid-2007  the pound euro rate remained range-bound  within  5   of 1.45

the process saw the bank of england creating new money for itself  which it then used to purchase
such as   secured   or   the initial amount stated to be created through this method was 75 billion  although
had given permission for up to 150 billion to be created if necessary  it was expected that the process would occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term  by 5 november 2009  some 175 billion had been injected using quantitative easing and the effectiveness of the process remained less successful in the long term  in july 2012  the final increase in the asset purchases finance meant qe had peaked at 375 billion  then holding solely uk government bonds  representing one third of the uk national debt 
the result of the
caused a major decline in the pound against other world currencies as the future of international trade relationships and domestic political leadership became unclear  the referendum result weakened sterling against euro overnight by 5   the night before the vote 1 was trading for 1.30  on the day following the referendum  when the result was clear  1 was trading at 1.23  by october 2016  the exchange rate was 1.12 to the pound  a fall of 14  since the referendum  against the us dollar  meanwhile  the pound fell from  1.466 to  1.3694 when the referendum result was first revealed  and down to  1.2232 by october 2016  a fall of 16

pre-decimal coins  
the silver penny  plural  pence  abbreviation  d  was the principal and often the only coin in circulation from the 8th century until the 13th century  although some fractions of the penny were struck  see
and    it was more common to find pennies cut into halves and quarters to provide smaller change  very few gold coins were struck  with the
 worth 20 silver pence  a rare example  however  in 1279  the   worth 4d  was introduced  with the half groat following in 1344  1344 also saw the establishment of a gold coinage with the introduction  after the failed   of the
worth six shillings and eight pence  6/8   i e  3 nobles to the pound   together with the half and quarter noble  reforms in 1464 saw a reduction in value of the coinage in both silver and gold  with the noble renamed the ryal and worth 10 -  i e  2 to the pound  and the

following the succession of the scottish king
to the english throne  a new gold coinage was introduced  including the

 20 -  and the rose ryal  30 -   the   worth 20 -  followed in 1619  the first base metal coins were also introduced 
and
  copper
coins followed in the reign of   during the   a number of siege coinages were produced  often in unusual denominations 
following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660  the coinage was reformed  with the ending of production of hammered coins in 1662  the
was introduced in 1663  soon followed by the 12  2 and 5 guinea coins  the silver coinage consisted of denominations of 1d  2d  3d  4d and 6d  1 -  2/6 and 5 -  due to the widespread export of silver in the 18th century  the production of silver coins gradually came to a halt  with the half crown and crown not issued after the 1750s  the 6d and 1 - stopping production in the 1780s  in response  copper 1d and 2d coins and a gold 13 guinea  7 -  were introduced in 1797  the copper penny was the only one of these coins to survive long 
to alleviate the shortage of silver coins  between 1797 and 1804  the bank of england counterstamped
 8 reales  and other
and
coins for circulation  a small counterstamp of the king s head was used  until 1800  these circulated at a rate of 4/9 for 8 reales  after 1800  a rate of 5 - for 8 reales was used  the bank then issued silver tokens for 5 -  struck over spanish dollars  in 1804  followed by tokens for 1/6 and 3 - between 1811 and 1816 
in 1816  a new silver coinage was introduced in denominations of 6d  1 -  2/6  half-crown  and 5 -  crown   the crown was only issued intermittently until 1900  it was followed by a new gold coinage in 1817 consisting of 10 - and 1 coins  known as the half sovereign and   the silver 4d coin was reintroduced in 1836  followed by the 3d in 1838  with the 4d coin issued only for colonial use after 1855  in 1848  the 2 -

during the   production of the half sovereign and sovereign was suspended  and although the gold standard was later restored  the coins saw little circulation thereafter  in 1920  the silver standard  maintained at  925 since 1552  was reduced to  500  in 1937  a nickel-brass 3d coin was introduced  the last silver 3d coins were issued seven years later  in 1947  the remaining silver coins were replaced with   with the exception of
which was then restored to  925  inflation caused the farthing to cease production in 1956 and be demonetised in 1960  in the run-up to decimalisation  the halfpenny and half-crown were demonetised in 1969

were introduced  these were
5p and 10p coins which were equivalent to  and circulated alongside  the one shilling coin and the two shilling or florin coin respectively 
1969  the curved equilateral
cupro-nickel 50p coin replaced the 10 - note 
1971  the decimal coinage was completed when decimalisation came into effect in 1971 with the introduction of the bronze 12p  1p and 2p coins and the withdrawal of the 1d and 3d coins 
1980  withdrawal of 6d coins  which had circulated at a value of 212p 
1982  the word  new  was dropped from the coinage and a 20p coin was introduced 
1983  a 1 coin was introduced 
1983  the 12p coin was last produced

1990  the crown  worth 25p  was re-tariffed for future issues as a commemorative coin at 5 
1990s  the 5p  10p and 50p coins became smaller 
1991  pre-decimal 1 - coins  which had continued to circulate with a value of 5p  were demonetised in 1991 after the 5p coin became smaller  at the same time larger first generation decimal 5p coins were demonetised 
1992

was becoming worthwhile  with a premium of up to 11   with smelting costs reducing this to around 4  although this is illegal  and the
of copper has subsequently fallen dramatically from these earlier peaks 
2012  the 5p and 10p coins were changed from cupro-nickel to  
2014  it was announced that in 2017 the pound coin will change to a more secure twelve-sided coin to discourage forgery 
at present  the oldest circulating coins in the uk are the 1p and 2p copper coins introduced in 1971  no other coins from before 1980 are in circulation  before decimalisation  a handful of change might have contained coins 100 or more years old  bearing any of five monarchs  heads 
in april 2008  an extensive redesign of the coinage was unveiled  the new designs were issued gradually into circulation  starting in mid-2008  the new reverses of the 1p  2p  5p  10p  20p and 50p coins feature parts of the   and the new pound coin depicts the whole shield  the coins have the same sizes  shapes and weights as those with the old designs  which will continue to circulate
