when expressed as a percentage  the thermal efficiency must be between 0  and 100   efficiency is typically less than 100  because there are inefficiencies such as friction and heat loss that convert the energy into alternative forms  for example  a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25  efficiency  and a large coal-fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46   advances in formula 1 motorsport regulations have pushed teams to develop highly efficient power units which peak around 45-50  thermal efficiency 
peaks at 51.7   in a
plant  thermal efficiencies are approaching 60   such a real-world value may be used as a

for engines where a fuel is burned there are two types of thermal efficiency  indicated thermal efficiency and brake thermal efficiency  this efficiency is only appropriate when comparing similar types or similar devices

the efficiency of even the best heat engines is low  usually below 50  and often far below  so the energy lost to the environment by heat engines is a major waste of energy resources  since a large fraction of the fuels produced worldwide go to powering heat engines  perhaps up to half of the useful energy produced worldwide is wasted in engine inefficiency  although modern  
and
schemes are beginning to use this heat for other purposes  this inefficiency can be attributed to three causes  there is an overall theoretical limit to the efficiency of any heat engine due to temperature  called the carnot efficiency  second  specific types of engines have lower limits on their efficiency due to the inherent
of the
they use  thirdly  the nonideal behavior of real engines  such as mechanical
and losses in the
process causes further efficiency losses 
carnot efficiency  
main article 
the
puts a fundamental limit on the thermal efficiency of all heat engines  even an ideal  frictionless engine can t convert anywhere near 100  of its input heat into work  the limiting factors are the temperature at which the heat enters the engine 
t

  displaystyle t  h    
  and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat

this limiting value is called the carnot cycle efficiency because it is the efficiency of an unattainable  ideal 
engine cycle called the   no device converting heat into mechanical energy  regardless of its construction  can exceed this efficiency 
examples of

it can be seen that since
t
c

is fixed by the environment  the only way for a designer to increase the carnot efficiency of an engine is to increase
t

  displaystyle t  h    
  the temperature at which the heat is added to the engine  the efficiency of ordinary heat engines also generally increases with   and advanced structural materials that allow engines to operate at higher temperatures is an active area of research 
due to the other causes detailed below  practical engines have efficiencies far below the carnot limit  for example  the average automobile engine is less than 35  efficient 
carnot s theorem applies to thermodynamic cycles  where thermal energy is converted to mechanical work  devices that convert a fuel s chemical energy directly into electrical work  such as   can exceed the carnot efficiency 
engine cycle efficiency  
the carnot cycle is
and thus represents the upper limit on efficiency of an engine cycle  practical engine cycles are irreversible and thus have inherently lower efficiency than the carnot efficiency when operated between the same temperatures

and
t
c
  displaystyle t  c    
  one of the factors determining efficiency is how heat is added to the working fluid in the cycle  and how it is removed  the carnot cycle achieves maximum efficiency because all the heat is added to the working fluid at the maximum temperature

  and removed at the minimum temperature

  in contrast  in an internal combustion engine  the temperature of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder is nowhere near its peak temperature as the fuel starts to burn  and only reaches the peak temperature as all the fuel is consumed  so the average temperature at which heat is added is lower  reducing efficiency 
an important parameter in the efficiency of combustion engines is the
of the air-fuel mixture    this varies somewhat with the fuel  but is generally close to the air value of 1.4  this standard value is usually used in the engine cycle equations below  and when this approximation is made the cycle is called an air-standard cycle 
otto cycle  automobiles the
is the name for the cycle used in spark-ignition
such as gasoline and
  its theoretical efficiency depends on the
r of the engine and the
 of the gas in the combustion chamber  558

thus  the efficiency increases with the compression ratio  however the compression ratio of otto cycle engines is limited by the need to prevent the uncontrolled combustion known as   modern engines have compression ratios in the range 8 to 11  resulting in ideal cycle efficiencies of 56  to 61  
diesel cycle  trucks and trains in the
used in   the fuel is ignited by compression in the cylinder  the efficiency of the diesel cycle is dependent on r and  like the otto cycle  and also by the cutoff ratio  rc  which is the ratio of the cylinder volume at the beginning and end of the combustion process

the diesel cycle is less efficient than the otto cycle when using the same compression ratio  however  practical diesel engines are 30  - 35  more efficient than gasoline engines  this is because  since the fuel is not introduced to the combustion chamber until it is required for ignition  the compression ratio is not limited by the need to avoid knocking  so higher ratios are used than in spark ignition engines 
rankine cycle  steam power plants the
is the cycle used in steam turbine power plants  the overwhelming majority of the world s electric power is produced with this cycle  since the cycle s working fluid  water  changes from liquid to vapor and back during the cycle  their efficiencies depend on the thermodynamic properties of water  the thermal efficiency of modern steam turbine plants with reheat cycles can reach 47   and in
plants  in which a steam turbine is powered by exhaust heat from a gas turbine  it can approach 60  
brayton cycle  gas turbines and jet engines the
is the cycle used in
and   it consists of a compressor that increases pressure of the incoming air  then fuel is continuously added to the flow and burned  and the hot exhaust gasses are expanded in a turbine  the efficiency depends largely on the ratio of the pressure inside the combustion chamber p2 to the pressure outside p1

other inefficiencies  
the above efficiency formulas are based on simple idealized mathematical models of engines  with no friction and working fluids that obey simple thermodynamic rules called the   real engines have many departures from ideal behavior that waste energy  reducing actual efficiencies far below the theoretical values given above  examples are 
of moving parts
inefficient combustion
heat loss from the combustion chamber
departure of the working fluid from the thermodynamic properties of an
aerodynamic drag of air moving through the engine
energy used by auxiliary equipment like oil and water pumps 
inefficient compressors and turbines
imperfect valve timing
another source of inefficiency is that engines must be optimized for other goals besides efficiency  such as low   the requirements for vehicle engines are particularly stringent  they must be designed for low   adequate acceleration  fast starting  light weight  low noise  etc  these require compromises in design  such as altered
to reduce emissions  that reduce efficiency  the average automobile engine is only about 35  efficient  and must also be kept idling at stoplights  wasting an additional 17  of the energy  resulting in an overall efficiency of 18   large stationary
have fewer of these competing requirements as well as more efficient rankine cycles  so they are significantly more efficient than vehicle engines  around 50  therefore  replacing
vehicles with   which run on a
that is charged with electricity generated by burning fuel in a power plant  has the theoretical potential to increase the thermal efficiency of energy use in transportation  thus decreasing the demand for fossil fuels 
when comparing different heat engines as sources of power  such as electric power or the power to run vehicles  the engine efficiency alone is only one factor  to give a meaningful comparison  the overall efficiency of the entire energy supply chain from the fuel source to the consumer must be considered  although the heat wasted by heat engines is usually the largest source of inefficiency  factors such as the energy cost of fuel refining and transportation  and energy loss in electrical transmission lines to transport it  may offset the advantage of a more efficient heat engine 
energy conversion

where the

quantities are heat-equivalent values 
so  for a boiler that produces 210kw  or 700,000 btu h  output for each 300kw  or 1,000,000 btu h  heat-equivalent input  its thermal efficiency is 210/300   0.70  or 70   this means that 30  of the energy is lost to the environment 
an
has a thermal efficiency close to 100   when comparing heating units  such as a highly efficient electric resistance heater to an 80  efficient natural gas-fueled furnace  an
is needed to determine the most cost-effective choice 
effects of fuel heating value  
main article 
the heating value of a
is the amount of
released during an
 e g     and is a characteristic of each substance  it is measured in units of
per unit of the substance  usually   such as  kj kg    
the heating value for
is expressed as the hhv  lhv  or ghv to distinguish treatment of the heat of phase changes 
 hhv  is determined by bringing all the products of combustion back to the original pre-combustion temperature  and in particular condensing any vapor produced  this is the same as the thermodynamic  
 lhv   or net calorific value  is determined by subtracting the
of the water vapor from the higher heating value  the energy required to vaporize the water therefore is not realized as heat 
gross heating value accounts for water in the exhaust leaving as vapor  and includes liquid water in the fuel prior to combustion  this value is important for fuels like
or   which will usually contain some amount of water prior to burning 
which definition of heating value is being used significantly affects any quoted efficiency  not stating whether an efficiency is hhv or lhv renders such numbers very misleading 
heat pumps and refrigerators  
 
and
use work to move heat from a colder to a warmer place  so their function is the opposite of a heat engine  the work energy  win  that is applied to them is converted into heat  and the sum of this energy and the heat energy that is moved from the cold reservoir  qc  is equal to the total heat energy added to the hot reservoir  qh

the reason for not using the term  efficiency  is that the coefficient of performance can often be greater than 100   since these devices are moving heat  not creating it  the amount of heat they move can be greater than the input work  therefore  heat pumps can be a more efficient way of heating than simply converting the input work into heat  as in an electric heater or furnace 
since they are heat engines  these devices are also limited by   the limiting value of the carnot  efficiency  for these processes  with the equality theoretically achievable only with an ideal  reversible  cycle  is

this is because when heating  the work used to run the device is converted to heat and adds to the desired effect  whereas if the desired effect is cooling the heat resulting from the input work is just an unwanted byproduct 
energy efficiency  
the  thermal efficiency  is sometimes called the energy efficiency  in the united states  in everyday usage the
is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices  as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode  for energy-conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated  e g    this furnace is 90  efficient   but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the

energy efficiency of heat exchangers  
a counter flow heat exchanger is generally 100  efficient in transferring heat energy from one circuit to the other  albeit at a slight loss in temperature  however  for a more complete picture of heat exchanger efficiency  exergetic considerations must be taken into account
