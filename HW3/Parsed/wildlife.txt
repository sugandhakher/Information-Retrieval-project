wildlife can be found in all   deserts  forests  rain forests  plains  grasslands  and other areas including the most developed
sites  all have distinct forms of wildlife  while the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors  most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities 
humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways including the legal  social  and moral sense  some animals  however  have adapted to suburban environments  this includes such animals as domesticated cats  dogs  mice  and gerbils  some religions declare certain animals to be sacred  and in modern times concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the
of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment 
the global wildlife population has decreased by 52 percent between 1970 and 2014  according to a report by the

relied on wildlife  both plants and animals  for their food  in fact  some species may have been hunted to
by early human hunters  today  hunting    and gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world  in other areas  hunting and non-commercial fishing are mainly seen as a

in november 2008  almost 900 plucked and  oven-ready  owls and other protected wildlife species were confiscated by the department of wildlife and national parks in malaysia  according to   the animals were believed to be bound for china  to be sold in wild meat restaurants  most are listed in

a november 2008 report from biologist and author sally kneidel  phd  documented numerous wildlife species for sale in informal markets along the amazon river  including wild-caught marmosets sold for as little as  1.60  5 peruvian soles   many amazon species  including peccaries  agoutis  turtles  turtle eggs  anacondas  armadillos  etc   are sold primarily as food  others in these informal markets  such as monkeys and parrots  are destined for the pet trade  often smuggled into the united states  still other amazon species are popular ingredients in traditional medicines sold in local markets  the medicinal value of animal parts is based largely on superstition   
religion  
many animal species have spiritual significance in different cultures around the world  and they and their products may be used as
objects in
rituals  for example

tourism  
many nations have established their tourism sector around their natural wildlife  south africa has  for example  many opportunities for tourists to see the country s wildlife in its national parks  such as the kruger park  in south india the periar wildlife sanctuary  bandipur national park and mudamalai wildlife sanctuary are situated around and in forests  india is home to many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries showing the diversity of its wildlife  much of its unique fauna  and excels in the range  there are 89 national parks  13 bio reserves and more than 400 wildlife sanctuaries across india which are the best places to go to see tigers  lions  elephants  rhinoceros  birds  and other wildlife which reflect the importance that the country places on nature and wildlife conservation 
destruction  
map of early   according to
  numbers are
before the present 
this subsection focuses on
forms of wildlife destruction 
of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from
130,000  70,000 years ago  the rate of
of entire species of plants and animals across the planet has been so high in the last few hundred years it is widely believed that we are in the sixth great extinction event on this planet  the  
destruction of wildlife does not always lead to an extinction of the species in question  however  the dramatic loss of entire species across earth dominates any review of wildlife destruction as extinction is the level of damage to a wild population from which there is no return   
the four most general reasons that lead to destruction of wildlife include overkill 
and   impact of introduced species and chains of extinction 
overkill  
wildlife is an invaluable treasure but it is being exploited due to illegal trade of many of its species overkill happens whenever hunting occurs at rates greater than the reproductive capacity of the population is being exploited  the effects of this are often noticed much more dramatically in slow growing populations such as many larger species of fish  initially when a portion of a wild population is hunted  an increased availability of resources  food  etc   is experienced increasing growth and reproduction as
inhibition is lowered  hunting 
and so on  has lowered the competition between members of a population  however  if this hunting continues at rate greater than the rate at which new members of the population can reach breeding age and produce more young  the population will begin to  
populations that are confined to islands  whether literal islands or just areas of habitat that are effectively an island for the species concerned  have also been observed to be at greater risk of dramatic population declines following  
habitat destruction and fragmentation  
main articles 
and
and increased road-building in the
are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas  increased resource extraction and further threats to  
the
of any given species is considered its preferred area or territory  many processes associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying capacity of the land for that species  in many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break-up of the wild landscape  agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented  or relictual  habitat  farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks 
examples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals  changes to natural fire regimes  forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion 
impact of introduced species  
     
and
are all examples of species that have become invasive threats to wild species in various parts of the world    frequently species that are uncommon in their home range become out-of-control invasions in distant but similar climates  the reasons for this have not always been clear and
felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be able to grow abundantly in a place in which they had not evolved  the reality is that the vast majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully  occasionally  however  some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers significantly  having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment of which they have become part 
chains of extinction  
this final group is one of secondary effects  all wild populations of living things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them  large
animals such as the
have populations of
birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo  should the hippo die out  so too will these groups of   leading to further destruction as other species dependent on the birds are affected  also referred to as a   this series of
is by far the most destructive process that can occur in any  
another example is the
and the
found in   these birds feed on insects on the back of cattle  which helps to keep them disease-free  destroying the nesting habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases
