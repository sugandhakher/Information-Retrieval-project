or a historical person
and the exact meaning of the - mark  ending 
most handbooks derive the first part of the word  and the name of the people  from a word meaning  flat land   related to german tenne  threshing floor   english den  cave   the -mark is believed to mean
or
 see    with probable references to the border forests in south  
the first recorded use of the word danmark within denmark itself is found on the two   which are
believed to have been erected by
 c 955  and

  tanmaurk    danmrk   on the large stone  and
  tanmarkar   pronounced  danmarka   on the small stone  the inhabitants of denmark are there called  tani    dan    or  danes   in the accusative
