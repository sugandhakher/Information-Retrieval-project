net metering  or net energy metering  nem  allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity anytime  instead of when it is generated  this is particularly important with wind and solar  which are   monthly net metering allows consumers to use solar power generated during the day at night  or wind from a windy day later in the month  annual net metering rolls over a net kilowatt credit to the following month  allowing solar power that was generated in july to be used in december  or wind power from march in august 
net metering policies can vary significantly by country and by state or province  if net metering is available  if and how long you can keep your banked credits  and how much the credits are worth  retail wholesale   most net metering laws involve monthly roll over of
credits  a small monthly connection fee  require monthly payment of deficits  i e  normal electric bill   and annual settlement of any residual credit  unlike a
 fit   which requires two meters  net metering uses a single  bi-directional meter and can measure current flowing in two directions  net metering can be implemented solely as an accounting procedure  and requires no special metering  or even any prior arrangement or notification 
net metering is an enabling policy designed to foster private investment in

history  
net metering originated in the united states  where small wind turbines and solar panels were connected to the electrical grid  and consumers wanted to be able to use the electricity generated at a different time or date from when it was generated  minnesota is commonly cited as passing the first net metering law  in 1983  and allowed anyone generating less than 40kw to either roll over any kilowatt credit to the next month  or be paid for the excess  in 2000 this was amended to compensation  at the average retail utility energy rate   this is the simplest and most general interpretation of net metering  and in addition allows small producers to sell electricity at the retail rate 
utilities in idaho adopted net metering in 1980  and in arizona in 1981  massachusetts adopted net metering in 1982  by 1998  22 states or utilities therein had adopted net metering  two california utilities initially adopted a monthly  net metering  charge  which included a  standby charge   until the puc banned such charges  in 2005  all u s  utilities were required to offer net metering  upon request   excess generation is not addressed  as of 2016 43 u s  states have adopted net metering  as well as utilities in 3 of the remaining states  leaving only 4 states without any established procedures for implementing net metering 
net metering was slow to be adopted in europe  especially in the united kingdom  because of confusion over how to address the value added tax  vat   only one utility company in great britain offers net metering 
the
government is reluctant to introduce the net metering principle because of complications in paying and refunding the
that is payable on electricity  but pilot projects are underway in some areas 
in   some provinces have net metering programs 
in the philippines  net metering scheme is governed by republic act 9513  renewable energy act of 2008  and it s implementing rules and regulation  irr   the implementing body is the energy regulatory commission  erc  in consultation with the national renewable energy board  nreb   unfortunately  the scheme is not a true net metering scheme but in reality a net billing scheme  as the dept of energy s net metering guidelines say   
net-metering allows customers of distribution utilities  dus  to install an on-site renewable energy  re  facility not exceeding 100 kilowatts  kw  in capacity so they can generate electricity for their own use  any electricity generated that is not consumed by the customer is automatically exported to the dus distribution system  the du then gives a peso credit for the excess electricity received equivalent to the dus blended generation cost  excluding other generation adjustments  and deducts the credits earned to the customers electric bill 
thus philippine consumers who generate their own electricity and sell their surplus to the utility are paid what is called the  generation cost  which is often less than 50  of the retail price of electricity 
controversy  
net metering is controversial as it affects different interests on the grid  a report prepared by peter kind of energy infrastructure advocates for the trade association edison electric institute stated that
systems  like   present unique challenges to the future of electric utilities  utilities in the united states have led a largely unsuccessful campaign to eliminate net metering
small scale viewpoint  
renewable advocates point out that while distributed solar and other energy efficiency measures do pose a challenge to electric utilities  existing business model  the benefits of distributed generation outweigh the costs  and those benefits are shared by all ratepayers  grid benefits of private distributed solar investment include reduced need for centralizing power plants and reduced strain on the utility grid  they also point out that  as a cornerstone policy enabling the growth of rooftop solar  net metering creates a host of societal benefits for all ratepayers that are generally not accounted for by the utility analysis  including  public health benefits  employment and downstream economic effects  market price impacts  grid security benefits  and water savings 
an independent report conducted by the consulting firm crossborder energy found that the benefits of california s net metering program outweigh the costs to ratepayers  those net benefits will amount to more than us 92 million annually upon the completion of the current net metering program 
a 2012 report on the cost of net metering in the state of california  commissioned by the california public utilities commission  cpuc   showed that those customers without distributed generation systems will pay us 287 in additional costs to use and maintain the grid every year by 2020  the report also showed the net cost will amount to us 1.1
by 2020  notably  the same report found that solar customers do pay more on their power bills than what it costs the utility to serve them  table 5  page 10  average 103  of their cost of service across the three major utilities in 2011  
large scale viewpoint  
many electric utilities state that owners of generation systems do not pay the full cost of service to use the grid  thus shifting their share of the cost on to customers without distributed generation systems  most owners of rooftop solar or other types of distributed generation systems still rely on the grid to receive electricity from utilities at night or when their systems cannot generate sufficient power 
a 2014 report funded by the institute for electric innovation reveals that net metering in california produces excessively large subsidies for typical residential rooftop solar pv facilities  these subsidies must then be paid for by other residential customers  most of whom are less affluent than the rooftop solar pv customers  in addition  the report points out that most of these large subsidies go to the solar leasing companies  which accounted for about 75 percent of the solar pv facilities installed in 2013  the report concludes that changes are needed in california  ranging from the adoption of retail tariffs that are more cost-reflective to replacing net metering with a separate  buy all - sell all  arrangement that requires all rooftop solar pv customers to buy all of their consumed energy under the existing retail tariffs and separately sell all of their onsite generation to their distribution utilities at the utilities  respective avoided costs 
comparison  
net metering  unlike a feed-in tariff  requires only one meter  but it must be bi-directional 
there is considerable confusion between the terms  net metering  and  feed-in tariff   in general there are three types of compensation for local  distributed generation 
 fit 
which is generally above retail  and reduces to retail as the percentage of adopters increases 
net metering
which is always at retail  and which is not technically compensation  although it may become compensation if there is excess generation and payments are allowed by the utility 
compensation which is generally below retail  also known as a  standard offer program   and can be above retail  particularly in the case of solar  which tends to be generated close to peak demand 
net metering only requires one meter  a feed-in tariff requires two 
time of use metering  
further information 
time of use  tou  net metering employs a special reversible
that is programmed to determine electricity usage any time during the day  time-of-use allows utility rates and charges to be assessed based on when the electricity was used  i e   day night and seasonal rates   typically the generation cost of electricity is highest during the daytime peak usage period  and lowest at night  time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable-energy sources  since  for example 
systems tend to produce energy during the daytime peak-price period  and produce little or no power during the night period  when price is low  italy has installed so many photovoltaic cells that peak prices no longer are during the day  but are instead in the evening  tou net metering affects the apparent cost of net metering to a utility 
market rate net metering  
further information 
in market rate net metering systems the user s energy use is priced dynamically according to some function of wholesale electric prices  the users  meters are programmed remotely to calculate the value and are read remotely  net metering applies such variable pricing to excess power produced by a qualifying system 
market rate metering systems were implemented in california starting in 2006  and under the terms of california s net metering rules will be applicable to qualifying photovoltaic and wind systems  under california law the payback for surplus electricity sent to the grid must be equal to the  variable  in this case  price charged at that time 
net metering enables small systems to result in zero annual net cost to the consumer provided that the consumer is able to shift demand loads to a lower price time  such as by chilling water at a low cost time for later use in air conditioning  or by charging a
during
times  while the electricity generated at peak demand time can be sent to the grid rather than used locally  see    no credit is given for annual surplus production 
excess generation  
excess generation is a separate issue from net metering  but it is normally dealt with in the same rules  because it can arise  if local generation offsets a portion of the demand  net metering is not used  if local generation exceeds demand some of the time  for example during the day  net metering is used  if local generation exceeds demand for the billing cycle  best practices calls for a perpetual roll over of the kilowatt credits  although some regions have considered having any kilowatt credits expire after 36 months  the normal definition of excess generation is annually  although the term is equally applicable monthly  the treatment of annual excess generation  and monthly  ranges from lost  to compensation at avoided cost  to compensation at retail rate  left over kilowatt credits upon termination of service would ideally be paid at retail rate  from the consumer standpoint  and lost  from the utility standpoint  with avoided cost a minimum compromise  some regions allow optional payment for excess annual generation  which allows perpetual roll over or payment  at the customers choice  both wind and solar are inherently seasonal  and it is highly likely to use up a surplus later  unless more solar panels or a larger wind turbine have been installed than needed 
energy storage  
net metering systems can have energy storage integrated  to store some of the power locally  i e  from the renewable energy source connected to the system  rather than selling everything back to the mains electricity grid  often  the batteries used are industrial
as these last for 10 to 20 years  lead-acid batteries are often also still used  but last much less long  5 years or so   lithium-ion batteries are sometimes also used  but too have a relatively short lifespan  finally 
last the longest with a lifespan of up to 40 years 
australia  
main article 
in some australian states  the  feed-in tariff  is actually net metering  except that it pays monthly for net generation at a higher rate than retail  with environment victoria campaigns director mark wakeham calling it a  fake feed-in tariff   a feed-in tariff requires a separate meter  and pays for all local generation at a preferential rate  while net metering requires only one meter  the financial differences are very substantial 
in victoria  from 2009  householders were paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid  this was around three times the retail price for electricity at that time  however  subsequent state governments reduced the feed-in in several updates  until in 2016 the feed-in is as low as 5 cents per kilowatt hour 
in queensland starting in 2008  the solar bonus scheme pays 44 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid  this is around three times the current retail price for electricity  however  from 2012  the queensland feed in tariff has been reduced to 6-10 cents per kilowatt hour depending on which electricity retailer the customer has signed up with 
canada  
allows net metering for up to 500kw  however credits can only be carried for 12 consecutive months  should a consumer establish a credit where they generate more than they consume for 8 months and use up the credits in the 10th month  then the 12-month period begins again from the date that the next credit is shown on an invoice  any unused credits remaining at the end of 12 consecutive months of a consumer being in a credit situation are cleared at the end of that billing 
areas of
serviced by bc hydro are allowed net metering for up to 50kw  at each annual anniversary the customer was paid 8.16 cents per kwh  if there is a net export of power after each 12-month period  which was increased to 9.99 cents kwh  effective june 1  2012  systems over 50kw are covered under the standing offer program  fortisbc which serves an area in south central bc also allows net-metering for up to 50kw  customers are paid their existing retail rate for any net energy they produce  the city of new westminster  which has its own electrical utility  does not currently allow net metering 
allows net metering for installations up to 100kw  credits from excess generated power can be carried over until march at which time any excess credits are lost 
allows net metering for installations up to 100kw  credits from excess generated power can be carried over until the customer s annual anniversary date  at which time any excess credits are lost 
european union  
denmark established net-metering for privately owned pv systems in mid-1998 for a pilot-period of four years  in 2002 the net-metering scheme was extended another four years up to end of 2006  net-metering has proved to be a cheap  easy to administer and effective way of stimulating the deployment of pv in denmark  however the relative short time window of the arrangement has so far prevented it from reaching its full potential  during the political negotiations in the fall of 2005 the net-metering for privately owned pv systems was made permanent 
the netherlands has net-metering since 2004  initially there was a limit of 3000kwh per year  later this limit was increased to 5000kwh  the limit was removed altogether on january 1  2014 
italy offers a support scheme  mixing net-metering and a well segmented premium  
slovenia has annual net-metering since january 2016 for up to 11 kva  in a calendar year up to 10 mva can be installed in the country 
in 2010
has been proposed by the asociacin de la industria fotovoltaica  asif  to promote   without requiring additional economic support  but net-metering for privately owned systems is not yet established 
some form of net metering is now proposed by   according to their website  energy produced by home-owners is bought at a higher price than what is charged as consumers  hence  some recommend to sell all energy produced  and buy back all energy needed at a lower price  the price has been fixed for 20 years by the government 
united states  
growth of net metering in the united states
net metering was pioneered in the united states as a way to allow solar and wind to provide electricity whenever available and allow use of that electricity whenever it was needed  beginning with utilities in idaho in 1980  and in arizona in 1981  in 1983  minnesota passed the first state net metering law  as of march 2015  44 states and
have developed mandatory net metering rules for at least some utilities 
net metering policies are determined by states  which have set policies varying on a number of key dimensions  the
required state electricity regulators to  consider   but not necessarily implement  rules that mandate
make available upon request net metering to their customers  several legislative bills have been proposed to institute a federal standard limit on net metering  they range from h r  729  which sets a net metering cap at 2  of forecasted aggregate customer peak demand  to h r  1945 which has no aggregate cap  but does limit residential users to 10kw  a low limit compared to many states  such as new mexico  with an 80,000kw limit  or states such as arizona  colorado  new jersey  and ohio which limit as a percentage of load 
arizona  california  colorado  connecticut  delaware  maryland  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  ohio  oregon  pennsylvania  utah  vermont  and west virginia are considered the most favorable states for net metering  as they are the only states to receive an  a  rating from freeing the grid in 2015 
regulators in multiple states are acting as referees in debates between utility companies and advocates of distributed resources  such as solar panel arrays  in 2016 the
 naruc  published the manual on distributed energy resources compensation as a way to help states decide on rate structures dealing with homes and businesses that generate their own power and send excess power back to the electric grid  the intention behind the manual is to  provide a consistent framework for evaluating rate design decisions in the age of distributed energy resources   the president of naruc  when he commissioned the manual  said his instructions to the committee writing the manual were to write a  practical  expert and most importantly ideologically neutral guide that offers advice  to states 
the
and the
both supported the manual  however  the main point of contention between utility companies and the solar industry is the question of whether
represent cost shift from those with the systems  people with solar panels  to those without them  everyone else who uses electricity  
phil moeller of the edison electric institute said   we want to der  distributed energy resources  but we want to make sure the rate structure is right to minimize cost shifts   moeller is a former member of the federal energy regulatory commission  ferc   a federal government regulatory agency  sean gallaher of the solar energy industries association said   there seems to be an assumption that revenue erosion from der results in an inadequacy of cost recovery for the utility andtherefyor a shift of costs to non-participating customers  you cant just assume that

nevada  
the state of nevada implemented net metering in 1997  up until 2016  utility companies in nevada paid the retail electricity rate to net metering consumers  nevadas utilities pay net metering customers an average of  623 per year in southern nevada and  471 per year in northern nevada   the major utility company in nevada is nv energy  
the nevada legislature passed legislation in 2015 that required the
to study the electric rate structure and come up with ways to shift costs  in december 2015  the commission updated the regulations so that utility companies would pay the wholesale rate to net metering consumers 
the group
and senator   the democratic leader in the u s  senate  expressed opposition to the commissions ruling  on february 8  2016  during a commission hearing  three individuals with guns attempted to enter the hearing  security guards turned them back  the individuals said they would return to the next commission hearing and would be armed 
ohio  
recently  it has become a popular trend for utilities in several states to dramatically increase their consumers  fixed charges in order to account for the cost-shift created by the growing number of net metering customers who do not cover their share of grid upkeep costs  which  subsequently  places the burden onto non-solar panel customers  the average increase of fixed charges is estimated at 20 percent 
in ohio 
 aep  proposed to more than double its fixed charges from  8.40 per month to  18.40 per month  affecting nearly 1.5 million customers in order to accommodate for the increase costs due to net metering 
aep was under investigation by the
 puco  for allegedly double-charging their customers a total of  120 million to supposedly cover fuel costs for one of their power plants in
and for two other power plants operated by   the double-charge would have affected 67 percent or 1 million customers who had opted out of an alternate supplier  in 2014  puco enlisted an outside firm to conduct an audit focusing on their consumers  charges  the findings concluded that the customers were indeed overpaying  at the same time  aep was being reimbursed for their fuel costs twice in a period from 2013-2015 
the office of the ohio consumer s council  under the auditor s advice  requested aep to disclose additional records  which was  in turn  denied by a puco administrative law judge  who agreed with aep s stance that their confidentiality be protected until the audit process was resolved  pablo vegas  the president and chief operating officer of aep ohio  insisted at the time that rates are based on actual costs of system operations  solidifying the company s claim that no deceptive action had taken place 
maine  
in maine  solar companies and major utility companies came to a legislative agreement in 2016 over net metering issues  the two sides said that their deal might increase solar power in maine  tenfold in five years   in response  several national solar companies paid for lobbyists to travel to maine and attempt to persuade state legislators to stop the deal  the legislation would replace net metering with a concept referred to as  next metering   under next metering  regulators would set the rates that utilities pay residential solar customers for the customers  excess energy   under normal net metering  utilities would pay the wholesale rate   the legislation includes a grandfather clause for existing solar customers 
missouri  
in the spring of 2016  the city of mt  vernon  missouri created a local net metering program  the local board of aldermen passed a measure on may 16  2016 that allows for residents and businesses to apply to  generate their own electricity while staying connected to the mt  vernon power grid   the board took up the issue after city residents asked about regulations regarding hooking up their own solar panels  the towns program would allow net metering  but consumers must pay for their own equipment including a bi-directional meter  participants would pay for power from the city at the regular rate that any other city consumer would pay  participants who create excess power would receive a credit on their utility bill  equal to what the city pays for the electricity at a wholesale rate from the distributor empire 
india  
indian states of tamil nadu  karnataka  and andhra pradesh have started implementation of net metering  and the policy has been announced by the respective state electricity boards in 2014  feasibility study will be done by the electricity boards  and after inspection the meters will be replaced by bidirectional ones and will be installed  applications are taken up for up to 30  of the distribution transformer capacity on a first-come  first-served basis and technical feasibility 
net purchase and sale  
net purchase and sale is a different method of providing power to the electricity grid that does not offer the price symmetry of net metering  making this system a lot less profitable for home users of small
systems 
under this arrangement  two uni-directional meters are installedone records electricity drawn from the grid  and the other records excess electricity generated and fed back into the grid  the user pays retail rate for the electricity they use  and the power provider purchases their excess generation at its avoided cost  wholesale rate   there may be a significant difference between the retail rate the user pays and the power provider s avoided cost 
germany  spain  ontario  canada   some states in the usa  and other countries  on the other hand  have adopted a price schedule  or
 fit   whereby customers get paid for any electricity they generate from renewable energy on their premises  the actual electricity being generated is counted on a separate meter  not just the surplus they feed back to the grid  in germany  for the solar power generated  a feed-in tariff is being paid in order to boost solar power  figure from 2009   germany once paid several times the retail rate for solar but has successfully reduced the rates drastically while actual installation of solar has grown exponentially at the same time due to installed cost reductions  wind energy  in contrast  only receives around a half of the domestic retail rate  because the german system pays what each source costs  including a reasonable profit margin  
related technology  
sources that produce   such as
must be coupled with an
to convert the output to   for use with conventional appliances  the phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid  and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed in the event of grid failure  this is for safety
for example  workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from  downstream  sources  in addition to being disconnected from the main  upstream  distribution grid  note  a small generator simply lacks the power to energize a loaded line  this can only happen if the line is isolated from other loads  and is extremely unlikely 
are designed for safety
while one inverter could not energize a line  a thousand might  in addition  all electrical workers should treat every line as though it was live  even when they know it should be safe 
solar guerrilla  
solar guerrilla  or the guerrilla solar movement  is a term originated by
and is applied to someone who connects solar panels without permission or notification and uses monthly net metering without regard for law
