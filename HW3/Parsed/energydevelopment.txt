of sugars synthesized by plants who use light energy from the sun  which runs from the nuclear energy produced by fusion of atoms of hydrogen  this material itself constitutes a form of energy  called  mass energy

main article 
the 2011   the second worst   displaced 50,000 households after
leaked into the air  soil and sea  radiation checks led to bans on some shipments of vegetables and fish 
the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject  since there are diverging views on this topic  and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source 
typically have high capital costs for building the plant  but low direct fuel costs 
in recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult  which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors  with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks  in eastern europe  a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance  notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania  and some potential backers have pulled out  where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure  this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects 
two months after the fukushimai failures  a global public support survey by
 2011  for energy sources was published and nuclear fission was found to be the least popular
analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties  to date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by
or
where many of the risks associated with construction costs  operating performance  fuel price  and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers  many countries have now liberalized the
where these risks  and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered  are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers  which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants 
two of the four

hydropower is produced in 150 countries  with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010  china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010  representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use  there are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 gw  the
in china 
across the brazil paraguay border  and
in venezuela 
the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low  making it a competitive source of renewable electricity  the average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u s  cents per kilowatt-hour  hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands  however  damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems  and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife  once a hydroelectric complex is constructed  the project produces no direct waste  and has a considerably lower output level of the

have developed a series of    that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change  and  renewable energy sources   in aggregate  constitute the largest number of their  wedges  
says producing all new energy with     and
by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050  barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be  primarily social and political  not technological or economic   jacobson says that energy costs with a wind  solar  water system should be similar to today s energy costs 
similarly  in the united states  the independent national research council has noted that  sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change  energy security  and the escalation of energy costs  renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states  taken collectively  can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand

increased energy efficiency  
a spiral-type integrated   which has been popular among north american consumers since its introduction in the mid-1990s
main article 
although increasing the efficiency of energy use is not energy development per se  it may be considered under the topic of energy development since it makes existing energy sources available to do work  22
efficient energy use  simply called energy efficiency  is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services  for example 
allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature  installing
or natural
reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional  
use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights  improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting an efficient technology or production process 
there are various motivations to improve energy efficiency  reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy efficient technology  reducing energy use is also seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing emissions  according to the   improved energy efficiency in   industrial processes and
could reduce the world s energy needs in 2050 by one third  and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases 
energy efficiency and
are said to be the twin pillars of sustainable energy policy  in many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate at which domestic energy resources are depleted

energy transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source  without the use of interconnecting wires

history of energy development  
energy generators past and present at   belgium  17th-century windmill scheldemolen and 20th-century
since prehistory  when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food  through the middle ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat  until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom  man has sought endlessly for energy sources from which to draw profit  which have been the fossil fuels  on one hand the coal to fuel the steam engines run industrial rails as well as maintain households  and secondly  the oil and its derivatives in the industry and transportation  primarily automotive   although have lived with smaller-scale exploitation of wind power  hydro and biomass  this model of development  however  is based on the depletion of fossil resources from periods of millions years without possibility for replacement as would be required to maintain  the search for energy sources that are inexhaustible and utilization by industrialized countries to strengthen their national economies by reducing its dependence on fossil fuels  has led to the adoption of nuclear energy and those with sufficient water resources  the intensive hydraulic use of their waterways 
since the beginning of the   the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest  in 1865 
published the coal question in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement  in 1914 
stated that the total production was 5.7 billion barrels  910,000,000m3   in 1956  geophysicist
deduces that u s  oil production will peak between 1965 and 1970  peaked in 1971  and that oil production will peak  within half a century  on the basis of 1956 data  in 1989  predicted peak by
in 2004  opec estimated  with substantial investments  it would nearly double oil output by 2025

the
has emphasized
of energy use and development 
is sustainable in its production  the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years   sustainability  also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products  especially   sources which have no direct waste products  such as wind  solar  and hydropower  are brought up on this point  with global demand for energy growing  the need to adopt various energy sources is growing 
is an alternative or complementary process to energy development  it reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently 
resilience  
energy consumption per capita  2001   red hues indicate increase  green hues decrease of consumption during the 1990s 
some observers contend that idea of  energy independence  is an unrealistic and opaque concept  the alternative offer of  energy resilience  is a goal aligned with economic  security  and energy realities  the notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book   energy strategy for national security  the authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of the united states  key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are centralized and easily susceptible to disruption  they conclude that a  resilient energy supply  is necessary for both national security and the environment  they recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized 
in 2008  former
chairman and ceo
looked to energy resilience  arguing that complete independence is unfeasible given the global market for energy  he describes energy resilience as the ability to adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy  to that end  he suggests the u s  make greater use of electricity  electricity can be produced from a variety of sources  a diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source  he reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is  sticky   meaning the electricity produced in the u s  is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas  according to grove  a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the u s  automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered  this  in turn  will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid  as organizations such as
have pointed out  advancements associated with the developing
would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries 
present and future  
outlookworld energy consumption by fuel  as of 2011 
incl 
increasing share of energy consumption by developing nations
 
extrapolations from current knowledge to the future offer a choice of energy futures  predictions parallel the
hypothesis  numerous are complex
based
as pioneered by   modeling approaches offer ways to analyze diverse   and hopefully find a road to rapid and
of humanity  short term
are also a concern of energy development  extrapolations lack plausibility  particularly when they predict a continual increase in oil consumption   
energy production usually requires an energy investment  drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy  the fossil fuel resources    that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert  they may thus require increasingly higher energy investments  if investment is greater than the energy produced by the resource  it is no longer an effective energy source  this means that resources  the wasteful ones  are not used effectively for energy production  such resources can be exploited economically in order to produce raw materials  they then become ordinary mining reserves  economically recoverable are not a positive energy sources  new technology may ameliorate this problem if it can lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources  although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded 
between 1950 and 1984  as the
transformed
around the globe  world grain production increased by 250   the energy for the green revolution was provided by
in the form of
 natural gas  
 oil   and
fueled   the peaking of world hydrocarbon production    may lead to significant changes  and require sustainable methods of production  one vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earth s surface  i e   buildings  vehicles and roads  doing
 using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer  efficiently than plants
