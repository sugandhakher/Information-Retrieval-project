jet b  
jet b is a fuel in the naphtha-kerosene region that is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance  however  jet b s lighter composition makes it more dangerous to handle  for this reason  it is rarely used  except in very cold climates  a blend of approximately 30  kerosene and 70  gasoline  it is known as wide-cut fuel  it has a very low freezing point of 60c  76f   and a low
as well  it is primarily used in some military aircraft  it is also used in canada  alaska  and sometimes russia  because of its low freezing point 
additives  
the def stan 91-91  uk  and astm d1655  international  specifications allow for certain additives to be added to jet fuel  including 
to prevent   usually based on
  e g   ao-30  ao-31  or ao-37

are to remediate microbial  i e   bacterial and fungal  growth present in aircraft fuel systems  currently  two biocides are approved for use by most aircraft and turbine engine
 oems   kathon fp1.5 microbiocide and biobor jf 
can be added to remediate the deleterious effects of trace metals on the thermal stability of the fuel  the one allowable additive is  
as the aviation industrys jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5  of all refined products derived from crude  it has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene  a high value product  by varying process techniques  new processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes  the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the manufacture of synthetic blend stocks  due to the number and severity of the processes used  it is often necessary and sometimes mandatory to use additives  these additives may  for example  prevent the formation of harmful chemical species or improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear 
water in jet fuel  
it is very important that jet fuel be free from water   during flight  the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases  due to the low temperatures in the upper   this causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel  the separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank  because it is denser than the fuel  since the water is no longer in solution  it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0c  if these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes  this was the cause of the
accident  removing all water from fuel is impractical  therefore  fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing 
there are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel  a visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water  as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance  an industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30ppm  parts per million  free water  a critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is astm standard d3948 standard test method for determining water separation characteristics of aviation turbine fuels by portable separometer 
military jet fuels

military organizations around the world use a different classification system of jp  for  jet propellant   numbers  some are almost identical to their civilian counterparts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives  jet a-1 is similar to   jet b is similar to   other military fuels are highly specialized products and are developed for very specific applications 
jet fuels are sometimes classified as kerosene or naphtha-type  kerosene-type fuels include jet a  jet a-1  jp-5 and jp-8  naphtha-type jet fuels  sometimes referred to as  wide-cut  jet fuel  include jet b and jp-4 
jp-1
was an early jet fuel specified in 1944 by the united states government  an-f-32   it was a pure kerosene fuel with high
 relative to aviation gasoline  and a freezing point of 60c  76f   the low freezing point requirement limited availability of the fuel and it was soon superseded by other  wide cut  jet fuels which were kerosene-naphtha or kerosene-gasoline blends  it was also known as avtur 
jp-2 and jp-3
are obsolete types developed during world war ii  jp-2 was intended to be easier to produce than jp-1 since it had a higher freezing point  but was never widely used  jp-3 was even more volatile than jp-2 and intended to improve production  but its volatility led to high evaporation loss in service 
was a 50-50 kerosene-gasoline blend  it had lower
than jp-1  but was preferred because of its greater availability  it was the primary
jet fuel between 1951 and 1995  its
code is f-40  it is also known as avtag 
jp-5
is a yellow kerosene-based jet fuel developed in 1952 for use in aircraft stationed aboard   where the risk from fire is particularly great  jp-5 is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons  containing     and
that weighs 6.8 pounds per u s  gallon  0.81kg l  and has a high
 min  60c or 140f   because some us   marine corps air stations and coast guard air stations host both sea-based and shore-based  e g    land based   naval aircraft  these installations will also typically fuel their shore-based aircraft with jp-5  thus precluding the need to maintain separate fuel facilities for jp-5 and non-jp-5 fuel  in addition  jp-5 may well have been used by other countries for their military aircraft  its freezing point is 46c  51f   it does not contain antistatic agents  jp5 is also known as nci-c54784  jp-5 s nato code is f-44  it is also called avcat fuel for aviation carrier turbine fuel 
the jp-4 and jp-5 fuels  covered by the mil-dtl-5624 and meeting the british specification def stan 91-86 avcat   formerly derd 2452   are intended for use in aircraft   these fuels require military-unique additives that are necessary in military   engines  and missions

has been working with the usaf to develop a synthetic jet fuel blend that will help them reduce their dependence on imported petroleum  the usaf  which is the united states military s largest user of fuel  began exploring alternative fuel sources in 1999  on december 15  2006  a
took off from
for the first time powered solely by a 50-50 blend of jp-8 and syntroleum s ft fuel  the seven-hour flight test was considered a success  the goal of the flight test program was to qualify the fuel blend for fleet use on the service s b-52s  and then flight test and qualification on other aircraft

to readers   july 2014    
jet fuel is very similar to   and in some cases  may be burned in   the possibility of environmental legislation banning the use of
avgas  and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance  has left aircraft designers and pilot s organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft  as a result  a few aircraft engine manufacturers  most notably
and   have begun offering
which run on jet fuel  this technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required  jet fuel is available in most places in the world  whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of
aircraft  a diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine  however  very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities  diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today  even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the
family had been used during the second world war 
jet fuel is often used in ground support vehicles at airports  instead of diesel  the united states military makes heavy use of jp-8  for instance  however  jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel  thereby increasing wear on fuel pumps and other related engine parts    civilian vehicles tend to disallow its use  or require that an additive be mixed with the jet fuel to restore its   jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances 
jet fuel contains more sulfur  up to 1,000ppm  which therefore means it is more lubricative and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require  the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel or ulsd brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers  pipeline diesels before ulsd were able to contain up to 500ppm of sulfur and was called low sulfur diesel or lsd  lsd is now only available to the off-road construction  locative and marine markets  as more epa regulations are introduced  more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production  thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel  as determined by astm standard d445
