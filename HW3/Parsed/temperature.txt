annual mean temperature around the world
a temperature is an objective comparative

 denoted f   and  especially in science 
 denoted k  
the coldest theoretical temperature is   at which the
of atoms and molecules reaches its minimum  classically  this would be a state of motionlessness  but quantum uncertainty dictates that the particles still possess a finite   absolute zero is denoted as 0k on the kelvin scale  273.15c on the celsius scale  and 459.67f on the fahrenheit scale

temperature scales differ in two ways  the point chosen as zero degrees  and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale 
the
scale  c  is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world  it is an empirical scale  it developed by a historical progress  which led to its zero point 0c being defined by the freezing point of water  with additional degrees defined so that 100c was the boiling point of water  both at sea-level atmospheric pressure  because of the 100 degree interval  it is called a centigrade scale  since the standardization of the kelvin in the international system of units  it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the kelvin scale  and so that a temperature increment of one degree celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin  though they differ by an additive offset of 273.15 
the united states commonly uses the
scale  on which water freezes at 32f and boils at 212f at sea-level atmospheric pressure 
many scientific measurements use the
 unit symbol  k   named in honor of the scottish physicist who first defined it  it is a thermodynamic or
scale  its zero point  0k  is defined to coincide with the coldest physically-possible temperature  called    its degrees are defined   the temperature of absolute zero occurs at 0k   273.15c  or 459.67f   and the freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at 273.15k   0c 
the
 si  defines a scale and unit for the kelvin or
by using the reliably reproducible temperature of the
of water as a second reference point  the first reference point being 0k at absolute zero   the triple point is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure  along with  for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume  an autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually contacting phases  vapour  liquid  and solid  dynamically depending only on the total internal energy of the mass of water  for historical reasons  the triple point temperature of water is fixed at 273.16 units of the measurement increment 
thermodynamic approach to temperature  
temperature is one of the principal quantities in the study of  
kinds of temperature scale  
there is a variety of kinds of temperature scale  it may be convenient to classify them as empirically and theoretically based  empirical temperature scales are historically older  while theoretically based scales arose in the middle of the nineteenth century 
empirically based scales  
empirically based temperature scales rely directly on measurements of simple physical properties of materials  for example  the length of a column of mercury  confined in a glass-walled capillary tube  is dependent largely on temperature  and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer  such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature  for example  above the boiling point of mercury  a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable  most materials expand with temperature increase  but some materials  such as water  contract with temperature increase over some specific range  and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials  a material is of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures  for example its boiling-point 
in spite of these restrictions  most generally used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind  especially  it was used for   which contributed greatly to the discovery of thermodynamics  nevertheless  empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics  empirically based thermometers  beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials  can be re-calibrated  by use of theoretical physical reasoning  and this can extend their range of adequacy 
theoretically based scales  
theoretically based temperature scales are based directly on theoretical arguments  especially those of thermodynamics  of kinetic theory  and of quantum mechanics  they rely on theoretical properties of idealized devices and materials  they are more or less comparable with practically feasible physical devices and materials  theoretically based temperature scales are used to provide calibrating standards for practical empirically based thermometers 
the accepted fundamental thermodynamic temperature scale is the kelvin scale  based on an ideal cyclic process envisaged for a  
an ideal material on which a temperature scale can be based is the   the pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature  some natural gases show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges that they can be used for thermometry  this was important during the development of thermodynamics  and is still of practical importance today  the ideal gas thermometer is  however  not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics  this is because the
at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity  which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics  the physical reason is that the ideal gas law  exactly read  refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure 
measurement of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from an ideal three-dimensional
can provide an accurate temperature measurement because the frequency of maximum spectral radiance of black-body radiation is directly proportional to the temperature of the black body  this is known as   and has a theoretical explanation in
and the  
measurement of the spectrum of noise-power produced by an electrical resistor can also provide an accurate temperature measurement  the resistor has two terminals and is in effect a one-dimensional body  the bose-einstein law for this case indicates that the noise-power is directly proportional to the temperature of the resistor and to the value of its resistance and to the noise band-width  in a given frequency band  the noise-power has equal contributions from every frequency  and is called   if the value of the resistance is known then the temperature can be found 
if molecules  or atoms  or electrons  are emitted from a material and their velocities are measured  the spectrum of their velocities often nearly obeys a theoretical law called the   which gives a well-founded measurement of temperatures for which the law holds  there have not yet been successful experiments of this same kind that directly use the
for thermometry  but perhaps that will be achieved in future 
absolute thermodynamic scale  
the kelvin scale is called absolute for two reasons  one is kelvin s  that its formal character is independent of the properties of particular materials  the other reason is that its zero is in a sense absolute  in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter  so that they have a limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature  according to the third law of thermodynamics  nevertheless  a kelvin temperature has a definite numerical value  that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition  this numerical value also depends on the properties of water  which has a
that can be reliably reproduced as a standard experimental phenomenon  the choice of this triple point is also arbitrary and by convention  the kelvin scale is also called the thermodynamic scale 
definition of the kelvin scale  
the thermodynamic definition of temperature is due to kelvin 
it is framed in terms of an idealized device called a   imagined to define a continuous cycle of states of its working body  the cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium  there are four limbs in such a   the engine consists of four bodies  the main one is called the working body  two of them are called heat reservoirs  so large that their respective non-deformation variables are not changed by transfer of energy as heat through a wall permeable only to heat to the working body  the fourth body is able to exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic work  it may be called the work reservoir  the substances and states of the two heat reservoirs should be chosen so that they are not in thermal equilibrium with one another  this means that they must be at different fixed temperatures  one  labeled here with the number 1  hotter than the other  labeled here with the number 2  this can be tested by connecting the heat reservoirs successively to an auxiliary empirical thermometric body that starts each time at a convenient fixed intermediate temperature  the thermometric body should be composed of a material that has a strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical thermometric variable and the amount of adiabatic isochoric work done on it  in order to settle the structure and sense of operation of the carnot cycle  it is convenient to use such a material also for the working body  because most materials are of this kind  this is hardly a restriction of the generality of this definition  the carnot cycle is considered to start from an initial condition of the working body that was reached by the completion of a reversible adiabatic compression  from there  the working body is initially connected by a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir number 1  so that during the first limb of the cycle it expands and does work on the work reservoir  the second limb of the cycle sees the working body expand adiabatically and reversibly  with no energy exchanged as heat  but more energy being transferred as work to the work reservoir  the third limb of the cycle sees the working body connected  through a wall permeable only to heat  to the heat reservoir 2  contracting and accepting energy as work from the work reservoir  the cycle is closed by reversible adiabatic compression of the working body  with no energy transferred as heat  but energy being transferred to it as work from the work reservoir 
with this set-up  the four limbs of the reversible carnot cycle are characterized by amounts of energy transferred  as work from the working body to the work reservoir  and as heat from the heat reservoirs to the working body  the amounts of energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoirs are measured through the changes in the non-deformation variable of the working body  with reference to the previously known properties of that body  the amounts of work done on the work reservoir  and the first law of thermodynamics  the amounts of energy transferred as heat respectively from reservoir 1 and from reservoir 2 may then be denoted respectively q1 and q2  then the absolute or thermodynamic temperatures  t1 and t2  of the reservoirs are defined so that to be such that

kelvin s original work postulating absolute temperature was published in 1848  it was based on the work of carnot  before the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics  kelvin wrote in his 1848 paper that his scale was absolute in the sense that it was defined  independently of the properties of any particular kind of matter   his definitive publication  which sets out the definition just stated  was printed in 1853  a paper read in 1851 
this definition rests on the physical assumption that there are readily available walls permeable only to heat  in his detailed definition of a wall permeable only to heat 
includes several ideas  the non-deformation state variable of a closed system is represented as a real number  a state of thermal equilibrium between two closed systems connected by a wall permeable only to heat means that a certain mathematical relation holds between the state variables  including the respective non-deformation variables  of those two systems  that particular mathematical relation is regarded by buchdahl as a preferred statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics   also  referring to thermal contact equilibrium   whenever each of the systems s1 and s2 is made to reach equilibrium with a third system s3 under identical conditions  the systems s1 and s2 are in mutual equilibrium   it may be viewed as a re-statement of the principle stated by
in the words   all heat is of the same kind   this physical idea is also expressed by bailyn as a possible version of the zeroth law of thermodynamics   all diathermal walls are equivalent   thus the present definition of thermodynamic temperature rests on the zeroth law of thermodynamics  explicitly  this present definition of thermodynamic temperature also rests on the first law of thermodynamics  for the determination of amounts of energy transferred as heat 
implicitly for this definition  the second law of thermodynamics provides information that establishes the virtuous character of the temperature so defined  it provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated in this definition will lead to the same ratio of thermodynamic temperatures  which in this sense is universal  or absolute  the second law of thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature defined in this way is positive  because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another  and the cycle can be imagined to operate only in one sense if net work is to be supplied to the work reservoir 
numerical details are settled by making one of the heat reservoirs a cell at the triple point of water  which is defined to have an absolute temperature of 273.16 k  the zeroth law of thermodynamics allows this definition to be used to measure the absolute or thermodynamic temperature of an arbitrary body of interest  by making the other heat reservoir have the same temperature as the body of interest 
temperature as an intensive variable  
in thermodynamic terms  temperature is an
because it is equal to a
of one
with respect to another  for a given body  it thus has the
of a
of two extensive variables  in thermodynamics  two bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a common wall  which has some specific permeability properties  such specific permeability can be referred to a specific intensive variable  an example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat  the intensive variable for this case is temperature  when the two bodies have been in contact for a very long time  and have settled to a permanent steady state  the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies  for a diathermal wall  this statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics 
in particular  when the body is described by stating its
u  an extensive variable  as a function of its
s  also an extensive variable  and other state variables v  n  with u   u  s  v  n   then the temperature is equal to the
of the internal energy with respect to the entropy

likewise  when the body is described by stating its entropy s as a function of its internal energy u  and other state variables v  n  with s   s  u  v  n   then the reciprocal of the temperature is equal to the partial derivative of the entropy with respect to the internal energy

the above definition  equation  1   of the absolute temperature is due to kelvin  it refers to systems closed to transfer of matter  and has special emphasis on directly experimental procedures  a presentation of thermodynamics by gibbs starts at a more abstract level and deals with systems open to the transfer of matter  in this development of thermodynamics  the equations  2  and  3  above are actually alternative definitions of temperature 
temperature local when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails  
real world bodies are often not in thermodynamic equilibrium and not homogeneous  for study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics  a body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into  cells  of small size  if classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation in such a  cell   then it is homogeneous and a temperature exists for it  if this is so for every  cell  of the body  then
is said to prevail throughout the body 
it makes good sense  for example  to say of the extensive variable u  or of the extensive variable s  that it has a density per unit volume  or a quantity per unit mass of the system  but it makes no sense to speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system  on the other hand  it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at a point  while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails  it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point  consequently  temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium  but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium 
thus  when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails in a body  temperature can be regarded as a spatially varying local property in that body  and this is because temperature is an intensive variable 
kinetic theory approach to temperature  
a more thorough account of this is below at  
provides a microscopic explanation of temperature  based on macroscopic systems  being composed of many microscopic particles  such as
and
of various species  the particles of a species being all alike  it explains macroscopic phenomena through the
of the microscopic particles  the
of kinetic theory asserts that each classical
of a freely moving particle has an average kinetic energy of kbt 2 where kb denotes   the translational motion of the particle has three degrees of freedom  so that  except at very low temperatures where quantum effects predominate  the average translational kinetic energy of a freely moving particle in a system with temperature t will be 3kbt 2 
it is possible to measure the average kinetic energy of constituent microscopic particles if they are allowed to escape from the bulk of the system  the spectrum of velocities has to be measured  and the average calculated from that  it is not necessarily the case that the particles that escape and are measured have the same velocity distribution as the particles that remain in the bulk of the system  but sometimes a good sample is possible 
  such as oxygen  o2   have more
than single spherical atoms  they undergo rotational and vibrational motions as well as translations  heating results in an increase in temperature due to an increase in the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules  heating will also cause  through   the energy associated with vibrational and rotational modes to increase  thus a
gas will require more energy input to increase its temperature by a certain amount  i e  it will have a greater
than a monatomic gas 
the process of cooling involves removing internal energy from a system  when no more energy can be removed  the system is at absolute zero  though this cannot be achieved experimentally  absolute zero is the null point of the
scale  also called absolute temperature  if it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero  all classical motion of its particles would cease and they would be at complete rest in this classical sense  microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics  however  matter still has
even at absolute zero  because of the  
basic theory  
temperature is a measure of a
of a state of a material the quality may be regarded as a more abstract entity than any particular temperature scale that measures it  and is called hotness by some writers  the quality of hotness refers to the state of material only in a particular locality  and in general  apart from bodies held in a steady state of thermodynamic equilibrium  hotness varies from place to place  it is not necessarily the case that a material in a particular place is in a state that is steady and nearly homogeneous enough to allow it to have a well-defined hotness or temperature  hotness may be represented abstractly as a one-dimensional manifold  every valid temperature scale has its own one-to-one map into the hotness manifold 
when two systems in thermal contact are at the same temperature no heat transfers between them  when a temperature difference does exist heat flows spontaneously from the warmer system to the colder system until they are in   heat transfer occurs by conduction or by thermal radiation 
experimental physicists  for example
and   found that there are indefinitely many   nevertheless  the zeroth law of thermodynamics says that they all measure the same quality 
temperature for bodies in thermodynamic equilibrium  
for experimental physics  hotness means that  when comparing any two given bodies in their respective separate   any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies  or that they have the same temperature  this does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings  but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be   a definite sense of greater hotness can be had  independently of   of   and of properties of particular materials  from
of   the temperature of a bath of
is   by a universal constant  to the frequency of the maximum of its   this frequency is always positive  but can have values that   thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium  these physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional   this is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium 
except for a system undergoing a
such as the melting of ice  as a closed system receives heat  without change in its volume and without change in external force fields acting on it  its temperature rises  for a system undergoing such a phase change so slowly that departure from thermodynamic equilibrium can be neglected  its temperature remains constant as the system is supplied with   conversely  a loss of heat from a closed system  without phase change  without change of volume  and without change in external force fields acting on it  decreases its temperature 
temperature for bodies in a steady state but not in thermodynamic equilibrium  
while for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium states  the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that they are at the same temperature  this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium  it can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter  and if this is so  then at least one of the bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature  nevertheless  any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical  non-absolute  hotness and temperature  for a suitable range of processes  this is a matter for study in  
temperature for bodies not in a steady state  
when a body is not in a steady state  then the notion of temperature becomes even less safe than for a body in a steady state not in thermodynamic equilibrium  this is also a matter for study in  
thermodynamic equilibrium axiomatics  
for axiomatic treatment of thermodynamic equilibrium  since the 1930s  it has become customary to refer to a   the customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies  which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium  should be said to have the same temperature by definition  but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale  a more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold  while the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature  the
selects the definition of a single preferred    unique up to an arbitrary scale factor  whence called the   if
is considered as a function of the volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium  thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of
with respect the

at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum  although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model  the
postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system

and
when an energy transfer to or from a body is only as heat  state of the body changes  depending on the surroundings and the walls separating them from the body  various changes are possible in the body  they include chemical reactions  increase of pressure  increase of temperature  and phase change  for each kind of change under specified conditions  the heat capacity is the ratio of the quantity of heat transferred to the magnitude of the change  for example  if the change is an increase in temperature at constant volume  with no phase change and no chemical change  then the temperature of the body rises and its pressure increases  the quantity of heat transferred  q  divided by the observed temperature change  t  is the body s

units

of water and 100c is its

in the united states  the fahrenheit scale is widely used  on this scale the freezing point of water corresponds to 32f and the boiling point to 212f  the rankine scale  still used in fields of chemical engineering in the u s   is an absolute scale based on the fahrenheit increment

and  approximately  in most gases  temperature is a measure of the mean particle kinetic energy  it also determines the probability distribution function of the energy  in condensed matter  and particularly in solids  this purely mechanical description is often less useful and the oscillator model provides a better description to account for quantum mechanical phenomena  temperature determines the statistical occupation of the microstates of the ensemble  the microscopic definition of temperature is only meaningful in the   meaning for large ensembles of states or particles  to fulfill the requirements of the statistical model

kinetic theory of gases  
a theoretical understanding of temperature in an ideal gas can be obtained from the  
and
developed a
that yields a fundamental understanding of temperature in gases  this theory also explains the
law and the observed heat capacity of
 or   gases

this relationship gives us our first hint that there is an
on the temperature scale  because it only holds if the temperature is measured on an
scale such as kelvins  the
allows one to measure temperature on this
scale using the   the temperature in kelvins can be defined as the pressure in pascals of one mole of gas in a container of one cubic meter  divided by the gas constant 
although it is not a particularly convenient device  the
provides an essential theoretical basis by which all thermometers can be calibrated  as a practical matter it is not possible to use a gas thermometer to measure absolute zero temperature since the gases tend to condense into a liquid long before the temperature reaches zero  it is possible  however  to extrapolate to absolute zero by using the ideal gas law  as shown in the figure 
the kinetic theory assumes that pressure is caused by the force associated with individual atoms striking the walls  and that all energy is translational   using a sophisticated symmetry argument

zeroth law of thermodynamics  
main article 
when two otherwise isolated bodies are connected together by a rigid physical path impermeable to matter  there is spontaneous transfer of energy as heat from the hotter to the colder of them  eventually they reach a state of mutual   in which heat transfer has ceased  and the bodies  respective state variables have settled to become unchanging 
one statement of the
is that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system  then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other 
this statement helps to define temperature but it does not  by itself  complete the definition  an empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system  such hotness may be defined as existing on a   stretching between hot and cold  sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold  and of numerical scales on it  so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature  to be suitable for empirical thermometry  a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable  such as pressure or volume  when all other relevant coordinates are fixed  an exceptionally suitable system is the   which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute kelvin scale  the kelvin scale is defined on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics 
second law of thermodynamics  
main article 
in the previous section certain properties of temperature were expressed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics  it is also possible to define temperature in terms of the
which deals with   the second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe  this can be understood in terms of probability 
for example  in a series of coin tosses  a perfectly ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails  this means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin tosses  there is only one set of toss outcomes possible  the set in which 100  of tosses come up the same  on the other hand  there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems  where some fraction are heads and the rest tails  a disordered system can be 90  heads and 10  tails  or it could be 98  heads and 2  tails  et cetera  as the number of coin tosses increases  the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases  for a very large number of coin tosses  the combinations to  50  heads and  50  tails dominates and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely  thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy 
it has been previously stated that temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems and it was just shown that the universe tends to progress so as to maximize entropy  which is expected of any natural system  thus  it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy  to find this relationship  the relationship between heat  work and temperature is first considered  a
is a device for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy  resulting in the performance of work  and analysis of the

states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient  thus  a heat engine operating between t1 and t3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles  one between t1 and t2  and the second between t2 and t3  this can only be the case if

for tc   0 k the efficiency is 100  and that efficiency becomes greater than 100  below 0 k  since an efficiency greater than 100  violates the first law of thermodynamics  this implies that 0 k is the minimum possible temperature  in fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nk  which was achieved in 1995 at nist  subtracting the right hand side of equation 5 from the middle portion and rearranging gives

has a sublimation temperature of 78.5c which is equivalent to 109.3f  on the absolute kelvin scale  however  this temperature is 194.6 k  on the absolute scale of thermodynamic temperature no material can have a temperature smaller than or equal to 0 k  both of which are forbidden by the  
temperature is basically defined for a body in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium  and in this definition  on an absolute scale  it is always positive  in an apparent contradiction of this reliable and valid rule  a so-called negative absolute  temperature  may be approximately defined for a component of a body that is not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium  a component may have a negative approximate  temperature  while the rest of the components of the body have positive approximate temperatures  such a non-equilibrium situation is either transient in time or is maintained by external factors that drive a flow of energy through the body of interest  an example of such a component is a spin system within a body  as follows 
in the quantum mechanical description of electron and nuclear spin systems that have a limited number of possible states  and therefore a discrete upper limit of energy they can attain  it is possible to obtain a   which is numerically indeed less than absolute zero  however  this is not the macroscopic temperature of the material  but instead the temperature of only very specific degrees of freedom  that are isolated from others and do not exchange energy by virtue of the  
a negative temperature is experimentally achieved with suitable radio frequency techniques that cause a
of spin states from the ground state  as the energy in the system increases upon population of the upper states  the entropy increases as well  as the system becomes less ordered  but attains a maximum value when the spins are evenly distributed among ground and excited states  after which it begins to decrease  once again achieving a state of higher order as the upper states begin to fill exclusively  at the point of maximum entropy  the temperature function shows the behavior of a   because the slope of the entropy function decreases to zero at first and then turns negative  since temperature is the inverse of the derivative of the entropy  the temperature formally goes to infinity at this point  and switches to negative infinity as the slope turns negative  at energies higher than this point  the spin degree of freedom therefore exhibits formally a negative thermodynamic temperature  as the energy increases further by continued population of the excited state  the negative temperature approaches zero asymptotically  as the energy of the system increases in the population inversion  a system with a negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero  but rather it has a higher energy than at positive temperature  and may be said to be in fact hotter at negative temperatures  when brought into contact with a system at a positive temperature  energy will be transferred from the negative temperature regime to the positive temperature region
