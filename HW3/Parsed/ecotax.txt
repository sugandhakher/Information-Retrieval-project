economic frameworks and strategies employing tax shifting and ecotaxes  
the object of a green tax shift is often to implement a    or     using fiscal policy to internalize market distorting externalities  which leads to
creation  the broader measures required for this are also sometimes called   especially in   where the government has generally employed this terminology  in some countries the name is  
tax shifting usually includes balancing taxation levels to be
for
and to maintain overall   it also usually includes measures to protect the most vulnerable  such as raising the minimum income to file income tax at all  or an increase to pension and social assistance levels to offset increased costs of fuel consumption 
basic economic theory recognizes the existence of
and their potential negative effects  to the extent that green taxes correct for externalities such as pollution  they correspond with mainstream economic theory  in practice  however  setting the correct taxation level or the tax collection system needed to do so is difficult  and may lead to further distortions or unintended consequences 
taxes on consumption may take the    approach advocated by   in which additional fees on less sustainable products  such as
 are pooled to fund subsidies on more sustainable alternatives  such as  
however  they may simply act as incentives to change habits and make capital investments in newer more efficient vehicles or appliances or to upgrade buildings  small changes in corporate tax rates for instance can radically change
of capital projects  especially if the averted costs of future fossil fuel use are taken into account 
the same logic applies to major consumer purchases  a    such as a   for example  recognizes that persons who do not drive cars and live generally energy-efficient lifestyles pay far less per month than others and accordingly have more to pay a heftier mortgage bill with  this justifies lending them much more money to upgrade a house to use even less energy overall  the result is a bank taking more per month from a consumer s income as utilities and car insurance companies take less  and housing stock upgraded to use the minimum energy feasible with current technology 
aside from energy  the refits will generally be those required to be maximally accommodating to  
gardens  for example    and a lifestyle that is generally localized in the community not based on commuting  the last  especially  raises real state valuations for not only the neighborhood but the entire surrounding region  consumers living sustainable lifestyles in upgraded housing will generally be unwilling to drive around aimlessly shopping  for instance  to save a few dollars on their purchases  instead  they ll stay nearer to home and create jobs in grocery delivery and small organic grocers  spending substantially less money on gasoline and car operation costs even if they pay more for food 
progressive or regressive   
some green tax shift proposals have been criticized as being fiscally
 a tax with an average tax rate that decreases as the taxpayer s income increases   taxing negative externalities usually entails exerting a burden on consumption  and since the poor consume more and save or invest less as a share of their income  any shift towards
can be regressive  in 2004  research by the
and
indicated that flat rate taxes on domestic rubbish  energy  water and transport use would have a relatively higher impact on poorer households 
however  conventional regulatory approaches can affect prices in much the same way  while lacking the revenue-recycling potential of ecotaxes  moreover  correctly assessing distributive impact of any tax shift requires an analysis of the specific instrument design features  for example  tax revenue could be redistributed on a per capita basis as part of a
scheme  in this case  the poorest would gain what the average citizen pays as ecotaxes  minus their own small contribution  no car  small apartment        this design would be highly progressive  alternatively  an ecotax can have a  lifeline  design  in which modest consumption levels are priced relatively low  even zero  in the case of water   and higher consumption levels are priced at a higher rate  furthermore  an ecotax policy package can include revenue recycling to reduce or eliminate any regressivity  an increase in an ecotax could be more than offset by a decrease in a  regressive  payroll or consumption tax  some proponents claim a second benefit of increased employment or lower health care costs as the market and society adjust to the new fiscal policy  these claims  as with the claim  tax cuts create jobs   are often difficult to prove or disprove even after the fact  
furthermore  pollution and other forms of environmental harm are often felt more acutely by the poor  who cannot  buy their way out  of being receptors of air pollution  water pollution  etc  such losses  although   have real economic welfare impacts  thus by reducing environmental harm  such instruments have a progressive effect
