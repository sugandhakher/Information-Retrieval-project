bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is a future
technology which produces

 energy from   use with
  the concept of beccs is drawn from the integration of trees and crops  which extract carbon dioxide  co2  from the atmosphere as they grow  the use of this biomass in processing industries or power plants  and the application of
via co2 injection into geological formations  there are other non-beccs forms of
and storage that include technologies such as  
and  
according to a recent
report  there is 550 000 tonnes co2 year in total beccs capacity currently operating  divided between three different facilities  as of january 2012

 ipcc   beccs was indicated as a key technology for reaching low carbon dioxide atmospheric concentration targets  the negative emissions that can be produced by beccs has been estimated by the
to be equivalent to a 50 to 150
decrease in

calls for more than 2

issued a joint report on carbon dioxide removal technologies as part of the avoid  avoiding dangerous climate change research program  stating that  overall  of the technologies studied in this report  beccs has the greatest maturity and there are no major practical barriers to its introduction into todays energy system  the presence of a primary product will support early deployment  
according to the    achieving lower concentration targets  450 ppm  depends significantly on the use of beccs

the main appeal of beccs is in its ability to result in negative emissions of   the capture of carbon dioxide from
sources effectively removes co2 from the atmosphere 
bio-energy is derived from biomass which is a
and serves as a carbon sink during its growth  during industrial processes  the biomass combusted or processed re-releases the co2 into the atmosphere  the process thus results in a net zero emission of co2  though this may be positively or negatively altered depending on the carbon emissions associated with biomass growth  transport and processing  see below under environmental considerations 
 ccs  technology serves to intercept the release of co2 into the atmosphere and redirect it into geological storage locations  co2 with a biomass origin is not only released from biomass fuelled power plants  but also during the production of
used to make paper and in the production of biofuels such as
and   the beccs technology can also be employed on such industrial processes 
it is argued that through the beccs technology  carbon dioxide is trapped in geologic formations for very long periods of time  whereas for example a tree only stores its carbon during its lifetime  in its report on the ccs technology  ipcc projects that more than 99  of carbon dioxide which is stored through geologic sequestration is likely to stay in place for more than 1000 years  while other types of carbon sinks such as the ocean  trees and soil may involve the risk of negative feedback loops at increased temperatures  beccs technology is likely to provide a better permanence by storing co2 in geological formations 
the amount of co2 that has been released to date is believed to be too much to be able to be absorbed by conventional sinks such as trees and soil in order to reach low emission targets  in addition to the presently accumulated emissions  there will be significant additional emissions during this century  even in the most ambitious low-emission scenarios  beccs has therefore been suggested as a technology to reverse the emission trend and create a global system of net negative emissions  this implies that the emissions would not only be zero  but negative  so that not only the emissions  but the absolute amount of co2 in the atmosphere would be reduced

technology  
main article 
the main technology for co2 capture from biotic sources generally employs the same technology as carbon dioxide capture from conventional fossil fuel sources  broadly  three different types of technologies exist      and  
cost  
the
technical potential for net negative emissions with beccs has been estimated to 10
of co2 equivalent annually  with an economic potential of up to 3.5 gt of co2 equivalent annually at a cost of less than 50  tonne  and up to 3.9 gt of co2 equivalent annually at a cost of less than 100  tonne 
policy  
based on the current
agreement  carbon capture and storage projects are not applicable as an emission reduction tool to be used for the
 cdm  or for
 ji  projects  recognising ccs technologies as an emission reduction tool is vital for the implementation of such plants as there is no other financial motivation for the implementation of such systems  there has been growing support to have fossil ccs and beccs included in the protocol  accounting studies on how this can be implemented  including beccs  have also been done 
techno-economics of beccs and the tesbic project  
the largest and most detailed techno-economic assessment of beccs was carried out by cmcl innovations and the tesbic group  techno-economic study of biomass to ccs  in 2012  this project recommended the most promising set of biomass fuelled power generation technologies coupled with carbon capture and storage  ccs   the project outcomes lead to a detailed biomass ccs roadmap for the u k  
environmental considerations  
see also 
some of the environmental considerations and other concerns about the widespread implementation of beccs are similar to those of ccs  however  much of the critique towards ccs is that it may strengthen the dependency on depletable fossil fuels and environmentally invasive coal mining  this is not the case with beccs  as it relies on renewable biomass  there are however other considerations which involve beccs and these concerns are related to the possible increased use of  
biomass production is subject to a range of sustainability constraints  such as  scarcity of arable land and fresh water  loss of biodiversity  competition with food production 
and scarcity of phosphorus  it is important to make sure that biomass is used in a way that maximizes both energy and climate benefits  there has been criticism to some suggested beccs deployment scenarios  where there would be a very heavy reliance on increased biomass input 
these systems may have other negative side effects  there is however presently no need to expand the use of biofuels in energy or industry applications to allow for beccs deployment  there is already today considerable emissions from point sources of biomass derived co2  which could be utilized for beccs  though  in possible future bio-energy system upscaling scenarios  this may be an important consideration 
the beccs process allows co2 to be collected and stored directly from the atmosphere  rather than from a fossil source  this implies that any eventual emissions from storage may be recollected and restored simply by reiterating the beccs-process  this is not possible with ccs alone  as co2 emitted to the atmosphere cannot be restored by burning more fossil fuel with ccs
