renewable heat is an application of
and it refers to the renewable generation of heat  rather than electrical power  e g  replacing a fossil fuel boiler using
to feed radiators   renewable heat technologies include renewable biofuels  solar heating  geothermal heating  heat pumps and heat exchangers to recover lost heat  significant attention is also applied to insulation 
many colder countries consume more energy for heating than electrical power  for example  in 2005 the united kingdom consumed 354twh of electric power  but had a heat requirement of 907twh  the majority of which  81   was met using gas  the residential sector alone consumed a massive 550twh of energy for heating  mainly in the form of gas  almost half of the final energy consumed in the uk  49   was in the form of heat  of which 70  was used by households and in commercial and public buildings  households used heat for mainly for space heating  69   and heating water 
the relative competitiveness of renewable electricity and renewable heat depends on a nation s approach to energy and environment policy  few renewable technologies  whether for heat  electricity or transport  are competitive with fossil fuels without some form of carbon valuation or subsidy  in those countries  such as sweden  denmark and finland  where government intervention has been closest to a technology-neutral form of carbon valuation  i e  carbon and energy taxes   renewable heat has played the leading role in a very substantial renewable contribution to final energy consumption  in those countries  such as germany  spain  the usa  and the uk  where government intervention has been set at different levels for different technologies  uses and scales  the contributions of renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies have depended on the relative levels of support  and have resulted generally in a lower renewable contribution to final energy consumption

leading renewable heat technologies  
solar heating  
is a style of building construction which uses the energy of summer or winter sunshine to provide an economic supply of primary or supplementary heat to a structure  the heat can be used for both
 see   and
 see    solar heating design is divided into two groups 
heating relies on the design and structure of the house to collect heat 
must also consider the storage and distribution of heat  which may be accomplished passively  or use air ducting to draw heat actively to the foundation of the building for storage  one such design was measured lifting the temperature of a house to 24c  75f  on a partially sunny winter day  -7c or 19f   and it is claimed that the system provides passively for the bulk of the building s heating  the 4,000-square-foot  370m2  home cost  125 per square foot  or 370m2 at  1,351 m2   similar to the cost of a traditional new home 
heating uses
to move air or a liquid from the
into the building or storage area  applications such as
and
typically capture solar heat in panels which can then be used for applications such as space heating and supplementation of residential water heaters  in contrast to   which are used to generate electricity  solar heating panels are less expensive and capture a much higher proportion of the sun s energy 
solar heating systems usually require a small supplementary backup heating system  either conventional or renewable 
geothermal heating  
hot springs located in nevada 
is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil  geothermal energy is an enormous  underused heat and power resource that is clean  emits little or no greenhouse gases   reliable  average system availability of 95    and homegrown  making populations less dependent on oil  
the earth absorbs the sun s energy and stores it as heat in the oceans and underground  the ground temperature remains constant at a point of 42 to 100f  6 to 38c  all year round depending on where you live on earth  a geothermal heating system takes advantage of the consistent temperature found below the earth s surface and uses it to heat and cool buildings  the system is made up of a series of pipes installed underground  connected to pipes in a building  a pump circulates liquid through the circuit  in the winter the fluid in the pipe absorbs the heat of the earth and uses it to heat the building  in the summer the fluid absorbs heat from the building and disposes of it in the earth 
heat pumps  
use work to move heat from one place to another  and can be used for both heating and air conditioning  though capital intensive  heat pumps are economical to run and can be powered by renewable electricity  two common types of heat pump are
 ashp  and
 gshp   depending on whether heat is transferred from the air or from the ground  air source heat pumps are not effective when the outside air temperature is lower than about -15c  while ground-source heat pumps are not affected  the efficiency of a heat pump is measured by the
 cop   for every unit of electricity used to pump the heat  an air source heat pump generates 2.5 to 3 units of heat  i e  it has a cop of 2.5 to 3   whereas a gshp generates 3 to 3.5 units of heat  based on current fuel prices for the united kingdom  assuming a cop of 3-4  a gshp is sometimes a cheaper form of space heating than electric  oil  and solid fuel heating  heat pumps can be linked to an inter  hot or cold   doubling the cop from 4 to 8 by extracting heat from warmer ground 
interseasonal heat transfer  
main article 
a heat pump with interseasonal heat transfer combines active solar collection to store surplus summer heat in thermal banks with ground-source heat pumps to extract it for space heating in winter  this reduces the  lift  needed and doubles the cop of the heat pump because the pump starts with warmth from the thermal bank in place of cold from the ground 
cop and lift  
a heat pump cop increases as the temperature difference  or  lift   decreases between heat source and destination  the cop can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature  e g   underfloor heating   and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature  e g   the ground   domestic hot water  dhw  and conventional radiators require high water temperatures  affecting the choice of heat pump technology  low temperature radiators provide an alternative to conventional radiators

resistive electrical heating  
renewable electricity can be generated by hydropower  solar  wind  geothermal and by burning biomass  in a few countries where renewable electricity is inexpensive 
is common  in countries like denmark where electricity is expensive  it is not permitted to install electric heating as the main heat source  wind turbines have more output at night when there is a small demand for electricity 
consume this lower cost electricity at night and give off heat during the day 
wood-pellet heating  
wood stove 
wood pellets 
and other types of wood heating systems have achieved their greatest success in heating premises that are off the gas grid  typically being previously heated using heating oil or coal  solid wood fuel requires a large amount of dedicated storage space  and the specialized heating systems can be expensive  though grant schemes are available in many european countries to offset this capital cost   low fuel costs mean that wood fuelled heating in europe is frequently able to achieve a payback period of less than 3 to 5 years  because of the large fuel storage requirement wood fuel can be less attractive in urban residential scenarios  or for premises connected to the gas grid  though rising gas prices and uncertainty of supply mean that wood fuel is becoming more competitive   there is also growing concern over the air pollution from wood heating versus oil or gas heat  especially the fine particulates 
wood-stove heating  
burning
in an open fire is both extremely inefficient  0-20   and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion  in the same way that a drafty building loses heat through loss of warm air through poor sealing  an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of warm air out of the building 
modern wood
designs allow for more efficient combustion and then heat extraction  in the united states  new wood stoves are certified by the
 epa  and burn cleaner and more efficiently  the overall efficiency is 60-80   and draw smaller volumes of warm air from the building 
 cleaner  should not  however  be confused with clean  an australian study of real-life emissions from woodheaters satisfying the current australian standard  found that particle emissions averaged 9.4g kg wood burned  range 2.6 to 21.7   a heater with average wood consumption of 4 tonnes per year therefore emits 37.6kg of pm2.5  i e  particles less than 2.5   this can be compared with a passenger car satisfying the current
 introduced september 2009  of 0.005g km  so one new wood heater emits as much pm2.5 per year as 367 passenger cars each driving 20,000km a year  a recent european study identified pm2.5 as the most health-hazardous air pollutant  causing an estimated 492,000 premature deaths  the next worst pollutant  ozone  is responsible for 21,000 premature deaths 
because of the problems with pollution  the australian lung foundation recommends using alternative means for climate control  the american lung association  strongly recommends using cleaner  less toxic sources of heat  converting a wood-burning fireplace or stove to use either natural gas or propane will eliminate exposure to the dangerous toxins wood burning generates including dioxin  arsenic and formaldehyde 
 renewable  should not be confused with  greenhouse neutral   a recent peer-reviewed paper found that  even if burning firewood from a sustainable supply  methane emissions from a typical australian wood heater satisfying the current standard cause more global warming than heating the same house with gas  however  because a large proportion of firewood sold in the australia is not from sustainable supplies  australian households that use wood heating often cause more global warming than heating 3 similar homes with gas 
high efficiency stoves should meet the following design criteria 
well sealed and precisely calibrated to draw a low yet sufficient volume of air  air-flow restriction is critical  a lower inflow of cold air cools the furnace less  a higher temperature is thus achieved   it also allows greater time for extraction of heat from the exhaust gas  and draws less heat from the building 
the furnace must be well insulated to increase combustion temperature  and thus completeness 
a well insulated furnace radiates little heat  thus heat must be extracted instead from the exhaust gas duct  heat absorption efficiencies are higher when the heat-exchange duct is longer  and when the flow of exhaust gas is slower 
in many designs  the heat-exchange duct is built of a very large mass of heat-absorbing brick or stone  this design causes the absorbed heat to be emitted over a longer period - typically a day 
renewable natural gas  
is defined as gas obtained from
which is upgraded to a quality similar to     by upgrading the quality to that of natural gas  it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas grid  according to the energy research centre of the netherlands  renewable natural gas is  cheaper than alternatives where biomass is used in a combined heat and power plant or local combustion plant   energy unit costs are lowered through  favourable scale and operating hours   and end-user capital costs eliminated through distribution via the existing gas grid 
energy efficiency  
renewable heat goes hand in hand with energy efficiency  indeed  renewable heating projects depend heavily for their success on energy efficiency  in the case of solar heating to cut reliance on the requirement supplementary heating  in the case of wood fuel heating to cut the cost of wood purchased and volume stored  and in the case of heat pumps to reduce the size and investment in heat pump  heat sink and electricity costs 
two main types of improvement can be made to a building s energy efficiency 
insulation  
improvements to insulation can cut energy consumption greatly  making a space cheaper to heat and to cool  however existing housing can often be difficult or expensive to improve  newer buildings can benefit from many of the techniques of   older buildings can benefit from several kinds of improvement 
solid wall insulation  a building with solid walls can benefit from internal or external insulation  external wall insulation involves adding decorative weather-proof insulating panels or other treatment to the outside of the wall  alternatively  internal wall insulation can be applied using ready-made insulation plaster board laminates  or other methods  thicknesses of internal or external insulation typically range between 50 and 100mm 
cavity wall insulation  a building with cavity walls can benefit from insulation pumped into the cavity  this form of insulation is very cost effective     
allow heating and cooling of a room to be switched off depending the time  day of the week  and temperature  a bedroom  for example  does not need to be heated during the day  but a living room does not need to be heated during the night 
roof insulation
insulated windows and doors
draught proofing
underfloor heating  
may sometimes be more energy efficient than traditional methods of heating 
water circulates within the system at low temperatures  35c - 50c  making gas boilers  wood fired boilers  and heat pumps significantly more efficient 
rooms with underfloor heating are cooler near the ceiling  where heat is not required  but warmer underfoot  where comfort is most required 
traditional radiators are frequently positioned underneath poorly insulated windows  heating them unnecessarily 
waste-water heat recovery  
recycling heat 
it is possible to recover significant amounts of heat from waste hot water via   major consumption of hot water is sinks  showers  baths  dishwashers  and clothes washers  on average 30  of a property s domestic hot water is used for showering  incoming fresh water is typically of a far lower temperature than the waste water from a shower  an inexpensive heat exchanger recovers up on average 40  of the heat that would normally be wasted  by warming incoming cold fresh water with heat from outgoing waste water
