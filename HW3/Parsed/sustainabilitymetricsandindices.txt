sustainable development indicators  sdi  are measures of   and attempt to quantify beyond the generic concept  though there are disagreements among those from different disciplines  and influenced by different political beliefs about the nature of the good society   these disciplines and international organizations have each offered measures or
of how to measure the concept 
while sustainability indicators  indices and reporting systems gained growing popularity in both the public and private sectors  their effectiveness in influencing actual policy and practices often remains limited 
contents
metrics and indices  
various ways of operationalizing or measuring sustainability have been developed  during the last 10 years   there has been an expansion of interest in sdi systems  both in industrialized and  albeit to a lesser extent  in   sdis are seen as useful in a wide range of settings  by a wide range of actors  international and intergovernmental bodies  national governments and government departments  economic sectors  administrators of geographic or ecological regions  communities  nongovernmental organizations  and the private sector 
sdi processes are underpinned and driven by the increasing need for improved quality and regularly produced information with better spatial and temporal resolution  accompanying this need is the requirement  brought in part by the information revolution  to better differentiate between information that matters in any given policy context versus information that is of secondary importance or irrelevant 
a large and still growing number of attempts to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as gdp  some of the most prominent of these include the
 hdi  of the united nations development programme undp   the
of
and its partner organizations  the  esi  and the pilot  epi  reported under the  wef   or the  gpi  calculated at the national or sub-national level  parallel to these initiatives  political interest in producing a
that would take at least the cost of pollution and natural capital depletion into account has grown  even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges 
at the heart of the debate over different indicators are not only different disciplinary approaches but also different views of   some indicators reflect the ideology of
and
that seek to define and measure progress on whether different countries or cultures agree to accept industrial technologies in their eco-systems  other approaches  like those that start from international treaties on cultural rights of indigenous peoples to maintain traditional cultures  measure the ability of those cultures to maintain their traditions within their eco-systems at whatever level of productivity they choose 
the lempert-nguyen indicator  devised in 2008 for practitioners  starts with the standards for sustainable development that have been agreed upon by the international community and then looks at whether intergovernmental organizations such as the undp and other development actors are applying these principles in their projects and work as a whole 
in using sustainability indicators  it is important to distinguish between three types of sustainability that are often mentioned in international development 
sustainability of a culture  human system  within its resources and environment 
sustainability of a specific stream of benefits or productivity  usually just an economic measure   and
sustainability of a particular institution or project without additional assistance   of an input  
the following list is not exhaustive but contains the major points of view 
 daly rules  approach  
university of maryland school of public policy professor and former chief economist for the world bank herman e  daly  working from theory initially developed by romanian economist
and laid out in his 1971 opus  the entropy law and the economic process   suggests the following three operational rules defining the condition of ecological  thermodynamic  sustainability 
renewable resources such as fish  soil  and groundwater must be used no faster than the rate at which they regenerate 
nonrenewable resources such as minerals and fossil fuels must be used no faster than renewable substitutes for them can be put into place 
pollution and wastes must be emitted no faster than natural systems can absorb them  recycle them  or render them harmless 
some commentators have argued that the  daly rules   being based on
and the   should perhaps be considered implicit or foundational for the many other systems that are advocated  and are thus the most straightforward system for operationalization of the bruntland definition  in this view  the bruntland definition and the daly rules can be seen as complementarybruntland provides the ethical goal of non-depletion of natural capital  daly details parsimoniously how this ethic is operationalized in physical terms  the system is rationally complete  and in agreement with physical laws  other definitions may thus be superfluous  or mere glosses on the immutable thermodynamic reality 
there are numerous other definitions and systems of operationalization for sustainability  and there has been competition for influence between them  with the unfortunate result that  in the minds of some observers at least  sustainability has no agreed-upon definition 
natural step approach  
main article 
following the  s report  one of the first initiatives to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by swedish cancer scientist   robrt coordinated a consensus process to define and operationalize sustainability  at the core of the process lies a consensus on what robrt came to call the natural step framework  the framework is based on a definition of sustainability  described as
 as derived from    in the natural step framework  a sustainable society does not systematically increase concentrations of substances extracted from the earth s crust  or substances produced by society  that does not degrade the
and in which people have the capacity to meet their needs worldwide 
ecological footprint approach  
main article 
ecological footprint accounting  based on the biological concept of   tracks the amount of land and water area a human population  needed to produce the resources the population consumes and to absorb its waste  under prevailing technology  this amount then is compared to available   in the world or in that region  the biocapacity represents the area able to regenerate resources and assimilate waste 
publishes every year results for all nations captured in un statistics 
the algorithms of ecological footprint accounts have been used in combination with the
methodology  s  zhao  z  li and w  li 2005   and a
has been derived from the latter  they have also been combined with a measure of   for instance through the    hpi  calculated for 178 nations  marks et al   2006   the happy planet index calculates how many happy life years each country is able to generate per
of ecological footprint 
one of the striking conclusions to emerge from ecological footprint accounting is that it would be necessary to have 4 or 5 back-up planets engaged in nothing but agriculture for all those alive today to live a western lifestyle  the footprint analysis is closely related to the
equation that  itself  can be considered a metric 
anthropological-cultural approach  
though sustainable development has become a concept that biologists and ecologists have measured from an eco-system point of view and that the business community has measured from a perspective of energy and resource efficiencies and consumption  the discipline of
is itself founded on the concept of sustainability of human groups within ecological systems  at the basis of the definition of
is whether a human group is able to transmit its values and continue several aspects of that lifestyle for at least three generations  the measurement of culture  by anthropologists  is itself a measure of sustainability and it is also one that has been codified by international agreements and treaties like the
of 1992 and the
to maintain a cultural group s choice of lifestyles within their lands and ecosystems 
  an organization of anthropologists and linguists working to protect
diversity  with a focus on language  has devised a sert of measures with
for measuring the survivability of languages and cultures in given eco-systems 
the lempertnguyen indicator of sustainable development  developed in 2008 by david lempert and hue nhu nguyen  is one that incorporates and integrates these cultural principles with international law 
circles of sustainability approach  
a number of agencies including the
cities programme 
and metropolis have since 2010 begun using the
approach that sets up a four-domain framework for choosing appropriate indicators  rather than designating the indicators that have to be used like most other approaches  it provides a framework to guide decision-making on what indicators are most useful  the framework is arranged around four domains - economics  ecology  politics and culture - which are then subdivided into seven analytically derived sub-domains for each domain  indicators are linked to each sub-domain  by choosing culture as one of its key domains  the approach takes into account the emphasis of the  anthropological  approach  above   but retains a comprehensive sense of sustainability  the approach can be used to map any other sustainability indicator set  this is foundationally different from the global reporting initiative index  below  which uses a triple-bottom-line organizing framework  and is most relevant to corporate reporting 
global reporting initiative index  
main article 
in 1997 the global reporting initiative  gri  was started as a multi-stakeholder process and independent institution whose mission has been  to develop and disseminate globally applicable sustainability reporting guidelines   the gri uses ecological footprint analysis and became independent in 2002  it is an official collaborating centre of the
 unep  and during the tenure of   it cooperated with the  s global compact 
energy  emergy and sustainability index  
in 1956 dr 
of the university of florida coined the term
and devised the accounting system of embodied energy 
in 1997 
m t  brown and s  ulgiati published their formulation of a quantitative sustainability index  si  as a ratio of the
 spelled with an  m   i e      not simply  energy   yield ratio  eyr  to the environmental loading ratio  elr   brown and ulgiati also called the sustainability index the  emergy sustainability index   esi    an index that accounts for yield  renewability  and environmental load  it is the incremental emergy yield compared to the environmental load  
sustainability index  emergy yield ratio environmental loading ratio  eyr elr
note  the numerator is called  emergy  and is spelled with an  m   it is an abbreviation of the term   embodied energy   the numerator is not  energy yield ratio   which is a different concept 
writers like leone  2005  and yi et al  have also recently suggested that the emergy sustainability index has significant utility  in particular  leone notes that while the gri measures behavior  it fails to calculate supply constraints the emergy methodology aims to calculate 
environmental sustainability index  
main article 
in 2004  a joint initiative of the
 ycelp  and the
 ciesin  of   in collaboration with the
and the
also attempted to construct an environmental sustainability index esi   this was formally released in   switzerland  at the annual meeting of the
 wef  on 28 january 2005  the report on this index made a comparison of the wef esi to other sustainability indicators such as the
index  however  there was no mention of the emergy sustainability index 
iisd sample policy framework  
in 1996 the
 iisd  developed a sample policy framework  which proposed that a sustainability index     would give decision-makers tools to rate policies and programs against each other   1996  p 9   ravi jain  2005  argued that   the ability to analyze different alternatives or to assess progress towards sustainability will then depend on establishing measurable entities or metrics used for sustainability  
sustainability dashboard  
the
has produced a      a free  non-commercial software package that illustrates the complex relationships among economic  social and environmental issues   this is based on
prepared for the united nations division for sustainable development  un-dsd december 2005 
wbcsd approach  
the
 wbcsd   founded in 1995  has formulated the business case for sustainable development and argues that  sustainable development is good for
and business is good for sustainable development   this view is also maintained by proponents of the concept of   the theory of industrial ecology declares that
should be viewed as a series of interlocking man-made ecosystems interfacing with the natural  
according to some economists  it is possible for the concepts of sustainable development and competitiveness to merge if enacted wisely  so that there is not an inevitable trade-off  this merger is motivated by the following six observations  hargroves   smith 2005  
throughout the economy there are widespread untapped potential
improvements to be made to be coupled with effective design 
there has been a significant shift in understanding over the last three decades of what creates lasting competitiveness of a firm 
there is now a critical mass of enabling technologies in eco-innovations that make integrated approaches to sustainable development economically viable 
since many of the costs of what economists call environmental externalities are passed on to governments  in the long-term sustainable development strategies can provide multiple benefits to the tax payer 
there is a growing understanding of the multiple benefits of valuing social and natural capital  for both moral and economic reasons  and including them in measures of national well-being 
there is mounting evidence to show that a transition to a sustainable economy  if done wisely  may not harm economic growth significantly  in fact it could even help it  recent research by ex- member joachim spangenberg  working with neo-classical economists  shows that the transition  if focused on improving resource productivity  leads to higher economic growth than business as usual  while at the same time reducing pressures on the environment and enhancing  
life-cycle assessment  
main article 
life-cycle assessment is a  composite measure of sustainability   it analyses the environmental performance of products and services through all phases of their life cycle  extracting and processing raw materials  manufacturing  transportation and distribution  use  re-use  maintenance  recycling  and final disposal 
sustainable enterprise approach  
building on the work of the   businesses began to see the needs of environmental and social systems as opportunities for business development and contribution to stakeholder value  this approach has manifested itself in three key areas of strategic intent   sustainable innovation     and    business strategies  now  as businesses have begun the shift toward sustainable enterprise  many business schools are leading the research and education of the next generation of business leaders  companies have introduced key development indicators to set targets and track progress on sustainable development  some key players   are

    university of michigan
  ross school of business  university of michigan
center for sustainable enterprise  university of north carolina  chapel-hill
community enterprise system  nabardximb sustainability trust  center for case research 
sustainable livelihoods approach  
see also 
and
another application of the term sustainability has been in the sustainable livelihoods approach  developed from conceptual work by   and the uk s institute for development studies   this was championed by the uk s  dfid    
 fao  as well as
such as  
and the african institute for community-driven development  khanya-aicdd   key concepts include the sustainable livelihoods  sl  framework  a holistic way of understanding livelihoods  the sl principles  as well as six governance issues developed by khanya-aicdd  a wide range of information resources on sustainable livelihoods approaches can be found at livelihoods connect
some analysts view this measure with caution because they believe that it has a tendency to take one part of the footprint analysis and i pat equation  productivity  and to focus on the sustainability of economic returns to an economic sector rather than on the sustainability of the entire population or culture 
fao types of sustainability  
the united nations  fao  has identified considerations for technical cooperation that affect three types of sustainability 
institutional sustainability  can a strengthened institutional structure continue to deliver the results of technical cooperation to end users  the results may not be sustainable if  for example  the planning authority that depends on the technical cooperation loses access to top management  or is not provided with adequate resources after the technical cooperation ends  institutional sustainability can also be linked to the concept of social sustainability  which asks how the interventions can be sustained by social structures and institutions 
economic and financial sustainability  can the results of technical cooperation continue to yield an economic benefit after the technical cooperation is withdrawn  for example  the benefits from the introduction of new crops may not be sustained if the constraints to marketing the crops are not resolved  similarly  economic  as distinct from financial  sustainability may be at risk if the end users continue to depend on heavily
activities and inputs 
ecological sustainability  are the benefits to be generated by the technical cooperation likely to lead to a deterioration in the physical environment  thus indirectly contributing to a fall in production  or well-being of the groups targeted and their society 
some ecologists have emphasised a fourth type of sustainability 
energetic sustainability  this type of sustainability is often concerned with the production of energy and mineral resources  some researchers have pointed to trends they say document the limits of production  see
for example 
 development sustainability  approaches  
sustainability is relevant to international development projects  one definition of development sustainability is  the continuation of benefits after major assistance from the donor has been completed   australian agency for international development 2000   ensuring that development projects are sustainable can reduce the likelihood of them collapsing after they have just finished  it also reduces the financial cost of development projects and the subsequent social problems  such as dependence of the stakeholders on external donors and their resources  all development assistance  apart from temporary emergency and humanitarian relief efforts  should be designed and implemented with the aim of achieving sustainable benefits  there are ten key factors that influence development sustainability   
participation and ownership  get the stakeholders  men and women  to genuinely participate in design and implementation  build on their initiatives and demands  get them to monitor the project and periodically evaluate it for results 
capacity building and training  training stakeholders to take over should begin from the start of any project and continue throughout  the right approach should both motivate and transfer skills to people 
government policies  development projects should be aligned with local government policies 
financial  in some countries and sectors  financial sustainability is difficult in the medium term  training in local fundraising is a possibility  as is identifying links with the private sector  charging for use  and encouraging policy reforms 
management and organization  activities that integrate with or add to local structures may have better prospects for sustainability than those that establish new or parallel structures 
social  gender and culture  the introduction of new ideas  technologies and skills requires an understanding of local decision-making systems  gender divisions and cultural preferences 
technology  all outside equipment must be selected with careful consideration given to the local finance available for maintenance and replacement  cultural acceptability and the local capacity to maintain equipment and buy spare parts are vital 
environment  poor rural communities that depend on natural resources should be involved in identifying and managing environmental risks  urban communities should identify and manage waste disposal and pollution risks 
external political and economic factors  in a weak economy  projects should not be too complicated  ambitious or expensive 
realistic duration  a short project may be inadequate for solving entrenched problems in a sustainable way  particularly when behavioural and institutional changes are intended  a long project  may on the other hand  promote dependence 
the definition of sustainability as  the continuation of benefits after major assistance from the donor has been completed   australian agency for international development 2000  is echoed by other definitions  world bank  usaid   the concept has however evolved as it has become of interest to non grant-making institutions  sustainability in development refers to processes and relative increases in local capacity and performance while foreign assistance decreases or shifts  not necessarily disappears   the objective of sustainable development is open to various interpretations
