icpd and abortion  
during and after the icpd  some interested parties attempted to interpret the term reproductive health in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or  indeed  a right to abortion  these interpretations  however  do not reflect the consensus reached at the conference  for the european union  where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere  the council presidency has clearly stated that the councils commitment to promote reproductive health did not include the promotion of abortion  likewise  the european commission  in response to a question from a member of the european parliament  clarified 
the term reproductive health was defined by the united nations  un  in 1994 at the cairo international conference on population and development  all member states of the union endorsed the programme of action adopted at cairo  the union has never adopted an alternative definition of reproductive health to that given in the programme of action  which makes no reference to abortion 
with regard to the us  only a few days prior to the cairo conference  the head of the us delegation  vice president   had stated for the record 
let us get a false issue off the table  the us does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion  and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning 
some years later  the position of the us administration in this debate was reconfirmed by us ambassador to the un    when she stated at a meeting of the un commission on the status of women that  nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion  she added  there is no fundamental right to abortion  and yet it keeps coming up largely driven by ngos trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition
