from august 2012 new regulations have been introduced including a temporary tax imposed to all operating pv plants  excluding residential applications   licensing of new pv projects have been put on halt and the feed-in tariffs were drastically reduced 
as of december 2013  the total installed photovoltaic capacity in greece reached 2,419.2 mwp
of which 987.2 mwp were installed in the period between januaryseptember 2013 despite the financial crisis  greece ranks 5th worldwide with regard to per capita installed pv capacity  it is expected that pv produced energy will cover up to 7  of the country s electricity demand in 2014
