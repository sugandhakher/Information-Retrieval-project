atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are determined by the balance between sources  emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems  and sinks  the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound   the proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the     af   more precisely  the annual airborne fraction is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year s total emissions  over the last 50 years  19562006  the airborne fraction for co2 has been increasing at 0.250.21  year 
non-greenhouse gases  
the major atmospheric constituents 
 n
2  
 o
2   and
 ar   are not greenhouse gases because
such as n
2 and o
2 and
molecules such as argon  ar  have no net change in the
when they vibrate and hence are almost totally unaffected by   although molecules containing two atoms of different elements such as
 co  or
 hcl  absorb infrared radiation  these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility  therefore  they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and usually are omitted when discussing greenhouse gases 
indirect radiative effects  
the false colors in this image represent concentrations of carbon monoxide in the lower atmosphere  ranging from about 390 parts per billion  dark brown pixels   to 220 parts per billion  red pixels   to 50 parts per billion  blue pixels  
some gases have indirect radiative effects  whether or not they are greenhouse gases themselves   this happens in two main ways  one way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas  for example  methane and carbon monoxide  co  are oxidized to give carbon dioxide  and methane oxidation also produces water vapor  that will be considered below   oxidation of co to co2 directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle  the peak of the thermal ir emission from earth s surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of co2  667cm1   on the other hand  the single co vibrational band only absorbs ir at much higher frequencies  2145cm1   where the  300k thermal emission of the surface is at least a factor of ten lower  on the other hand  oxidation of methane to co2  which requires reactions with the oh radical  produces an instantaneous reduction  since co2 is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane  but it has a longer lifetime  as described below this is not the whole story  since the oxidations of co and ch
4 are intertwined by both consuming oh radicals  in any case  the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing 
a second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases  for example  the destruction of
 nmvocs  in the atmosphere can produce ozone  the size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted 
methane has a number of indirect effects in addition to forming co2  firstly  the main chemical that destroys methane in the atmosphere is the
 oh   methane reacts with oh and so more methane means that the concentration of oh goes down  effectively  methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect  the second effect is that the oxidation of methane can produce ozone  thirdly  as well as making co2 the oxidation of methane produces water  this is a major source of water vapor in the   which is otherwise very dry  co and nmvoc also produce co2 when they are oxidized  they remove oh from the atmosphere and this leads to higher concentrations of methane  the surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of co is three times that of co2  the same process that converts nmvoc to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone  halocarbons have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone  finally
can lead to ozone production and ch
4 increases as well as producing water vapor in the stratosphere 
contribution of clouds to earth s greenhouse effect  
the major non-gas contributor to earth s greenhouse effect    also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the greenhouse gases  clouds are water droplets or
suspended in the atmosphere 
impacts on the overall greenhouse effect  
schmidt et al   2010  analysed how individual components of the atmosphere contribute to the total greenhouse effect  they estimated that water vapor accounts for about 50  of earth s greenhouse effect  with clouds contributing 25   carbon dioxide 20   and the minor greenhouse gases and
accounting for the remaining 5   in the study  the reference model atmosphere is for 1980 conditions  image credit   
the contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is affected by the characteristics of that gas  its abundance  and any indirect effects it may cause  for example  the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 72 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller  in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime  on the other hand  in addition to its direct radiative impact  methane has a large  indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation  shindell et al   2005  argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect 
when ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect  the most important are

in addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above  other greenhouse gases include  
and
 see    some greenhouse gases are not often listed  for example 
has a high
 gwp  but is only present in very small quantities 
proportion of direct effects at a given moment  
it is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect  this is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others  so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas  the higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone  the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases  in addition  some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified 
atmospheric lifetime  
aside from   which has a
of about nine days  major greenhouse gases are well mixed and take many years to leave the atmosphere  although it is not easy to know with precision how long it takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere  there are estimates for the principal greenhouse gases  jacob  1999  defines the lifetime

x in a one- as the average time that a molecule of x remains in the box  mathematically

the atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere  individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil  the oceans and other waters  or vegetation and other biological systems  reducing the excess to background concentrations  the average time taken to achieve this is the  
has a variable atmospheric lifetime  and cannot be specified precisely  the atmospheric lifetime of co2 is estimated of the order of 3095 years  this figure accounts for co2 molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean  photosynthesis  and other processes  however  this excludes the balancing fluxes of co2 into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs  which have slower characteristic rates  although more than half of the co2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century  some fraction  about 20   of emitted co2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years 
similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases  many of which have longer mean lifetimes than co2  e g  
has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 114 years 
radiative forcing  
earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun  reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as   earth s surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy  if this
is shifted  earth s surface could become warmer or cooler  leading to a variety of changes in global climate 
a number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in earth s climate  greenhouse gases are one such mechanism  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from earth s surface  causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere  as   some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries  and therefore can affect earth s energy balance over a long time period  factors that influence earth s energy balance can be quantified in terms of     positive radiative forcing indicates warming  for example  by increasing incoming energy or decreasing the amount of energy that escapes to space   whereas negative forcing is associated with cooling 
global warming potential  
the
 gwp  depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime  gwp is measured relative to the same mass of co2 and evaluated for a specific timescale  thus  if a gas has a high  positive 
but also a short lifetime  it will have a large gwp on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale  conversely  if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than co2 its gwp will increase with the timescale considered  carbon dioxide is defined to have a gwp of 1 over all time periods 
has an atmospheric lifetime of 12  3 years  the
lists the gwp as 72 over a time scale of 20 years  25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years  a 2014 analysis  however  states that although methane s initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of co2  because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime  after six or seven decades  the impact of the two gases is about equal  and from then on methane s relative role continues to decline  the decrease in gwp at longer times is because
is degraded to water and co2 through chemical reactions in the atmosphere

relative to co2 for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table

400,000 years of ice core data
provide evidence for greenhouse gas concentration variations over the past 800,000 years  see the    both co2 and ch
4 vary between glacial and interglacial phases  and concentrations of these gases correlate strongly with temperature  direct data does not exist for periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record  a record that indicates co2
stayed within a range of 180ppm to 280ppm throughout the last 800,000 years  until the increase of the last 250 years  however  various proxies and modeling suggests larger variations in past epochs  500 million years ago co2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now  indeed  higher co2 concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the
eon  with concentrations four to six times current concentrations during the mesozoic era  and ten to fifteen times current concentrations during the early palaeozoic era until the middle of the
period  about 400   the spread of land plants is thought to have reduced co2 concentrations during the late devonian  and plant activities as both sources and sinks of co2 have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks  earlier still  a 200-million year period of intermittent  widespread glaciation extending close to the equator    appears to have been ended suddenly  about 550 ma  by a colossal volcanic outgassing that raised the co2 concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12   about 350 times modern levels  causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as
at the rate of about 1mm per day  this episode marked the close of the precambrian eon  and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions of the phanerozoic  during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved  no volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since  in the modern era  emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are only about 1  of emissions from human sources 
ice cores  
show that before industrial emissions started atmospheric co2 mole fractions were about 280
 ppm   and stayed between 260 and 280 during the preceding ten thousand years  carbon dioxide mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the 1900s  rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009  one study using evidence from
of fossilized leaves suggests greater variability  with carbon dioxide mole fractions above 300ppm during the period seven to ten thousand years ago  though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems rather than actual co2 variability  because of the way air is trapped in ice  pores in the ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn  and the time period represented in each ice sample analyzed  these figures represent averages of atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or decadal levels 
changes since the industrial revolution  
recent year-to-year increase of atmospheric co2 
major greenhouse gas trends 
since the beginning of the   the concentrations of most of the greenhouse gases have increased  for example  the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280ppm by about 36  to 380ppm  or 100ppm over modern pre-industrial levels  the first 50ppm increase took place in about 200 years  from the start of the industrial revolution to around 1973     however the next 50ppm increase took place in about 33 years  from 1973 to 2006 
recent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate  in the 1960s  the average annual increase was only 37  of what it was in 2000 through 2007 
today  the stock of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than 3 million tonnes per annum  0.04   compared with the existing stock    this increase is the result of human activities by burning fossil fuels  deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and boreal regions 
the other greenhouse gases produced from human activity show similar increases in both amount and rate of increase  many observations are available online in a variety of  
anthropogenic greenhouse gases  
this graph shows changes in the annual greenhouse gas index  aggi  between 1979 and 2011 
the aggi measures the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere based on their ability to cause changes in earth s climate 
this bar graph shows global greenhouse gas emissions by sector from 1990 to 2005  measured in  
modern global co2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels 
since about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are currently 100ppm higher than pre-industrial levels  natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity  but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks  mainly photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton  as a result of this balance  the atmospheric mole fraction of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum and the start of the industrial era 
it is likely that
 i e   human-induced  warming  such as that due to elevated greenhouse gas levels  has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems  future warming is projected to have a range of   including   increased frequencies and severities of some
events  loss of   and regional changes in

international   which came into force in 2005  emissions limitations specified in the kyoto protocol expired in 2012  the   agreed in 2010  includes voluntary pledges made by 76 countries to control emissions  at the time of the agreement  these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85  of annual global emissions

tourism  
according to
global
is closely linked to   tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  tourism accounts for about 50  of traffic movements  rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5  of the production of co2  the number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020  adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions 
road haulage  
the road haulage industry plays a part in production of co2  contributing around 20  of the uk s total carbon emissions a year  with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39   average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are fallingin the thirty-year period from 19772007  the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent  nox emissions are also down 87 percent  whereas journey times have fallen by around a third  due to their size 
often receive criticism regarding their co2 emissions  however  rapid development in engine technology and fuel management is having a largely positive effect 
role of water vapor  
increasing water vapor in the stratosphere at boulder  colorado 
accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect  between 36  and 66  for clear sky conditions and between 66  and 85  when including clouds  water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally  but human activity does not significantly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales  such as near irrigated fields  the atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature  from less than 0.01  in extremely cold regions up to 3  by mass in saturated air at about 32c   see   
the average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about nine days  compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as ch
4 and co2  thus  water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other greenhouse gases  the
establishes that more water vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures  this and other basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the concentration of water vapor  assuming that the
remains approximately constant  modeling and observational studies find that this is indeed so   because water vapor is a greenhouse gas  this results in further warming and so is a    that amplifies the original warming  eventually other earth processes offset these positive feedbacks  stabilizing the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of earth s water through a venus-like  
direct greenhouse gas emissions  
between the period 1970 to 2004  ghg emissions  measured in   increased at an average rate of 1.6  per year  with co2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels growing at a rate of 1.9  per year  total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were estimated at 49.5
co2-equivalent  15 these emissions include co2 from fossil fuel use and from land use  as well as emissions of methane  nitrous oxide and other ghgs covered by the  
at present  the primary source of co2 emissions is the burning of     and
for electricity and heat 
regional and national attribution of emissions  
see also 
this figure shows the relative fraction of anthropogenic greenhouse gases coming from each of eight categories of sources  as estimated by the emission database for global atmospheric research version 3.2  fast track 2000 project  1   these values are intended to provide a snapshot of global annual greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2000  the top panel shows the sum over all anthropogenic greenhouse gases  weighted by their global warming potential over the next 100 years  this consists of 72  carbon dioxide  18  methane  8  nitrous oxide and 1  other gases  lower panels show the comparable information for each of these three primary greenhouse gases  with the same coloring of sectors as used in the top chart  segments with less than 1  fraction are not labeled 
there are several different ways of measuring ghg emissions  for example  see world bank  2010  362 for tables of national emissions data  some variables that have been reported include 
definition of measurement boundaries  emissions can be attributed geographically  to the area where they were emitted  the territory principle  or by the activity principle to the territory produced the emissions  these two principles result in different totals when measuring  for example  electricity importation from one country to another  or emissions at an international airport 
time horizon of different ghgs  contribution of a given ghg is reported as a co2 equivalent  the calculation to determine this takes into account how long that gas remains in the atmosphere  this is not always known accurately and calculations must be regularly updated to reflect new information 
what sectors are included in the calculation  e g   energy industries  industrial processes  agriculture etc    there is often a conflict between transparency and availability of data 
the measurement protocol itself  this may be via direct measurement or estimation  the four main methods are the emission factor-based method  mass balance method  predictive emissions monitoring systems  and continuous emissions monitoring systems  these methods differ in accuracy  cost  and usability 
these different measures are sometimes used by different countries to assert various policy ethical positions on climate change  banuri et al   1996  p 94   this use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability  which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets  there are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool  or at least the development of communication between different tools 
emissions may be measured over long time periods  this measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions  cumulative emissions give some indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of ghgs  iea  2007  p 199  
the national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions  the national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and imports  for many richer nations  such as the united states  the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported  this is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries  leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods  we believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country  so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels  holtz-eakin  1995  pp  85 101  
emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods  emissions changes may  for example  be measured against a base year of 1990  1990 was used in the
 unfccc  as the base year for emissions  and is also used in the
 some gases are also measured from the year 1995   146,149 a country s emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year 
another measurement is of per capita emissions  this divides a country s total annual emissions by its mid-year population  370 per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions  banuri et al   1996  pp 106107  
land-use change  
greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture  forestry and other land use  19702010 
land-use change  e g   the clearing of forests for agricultural use  can affect the concentration of ghgs in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into   accounting for land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure  net  emissions  i e   gross emissions from all ghg sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks  banuri et al   1996  pp 9293  
there are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions  additionally  there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time  banuri et al   1996  p 93   for instance  concentrating on more recent changes in carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier  e g   europe

the table above to the left is based on banuri et al   1996  p 94   overall  developed countries accounted for 83.8  of industrial co2 emissions over this time period  and 67.8  of total co2 emissions  developing countries accounted for industrial co2 emissions of 16.2  over this time period  and 32.2  of total co2 emissions  the estimate of total co2 emissions includes
carbon emissions  mainly from deforestation  banuri et al   1996  p 94  calculated per capita cumulative emissions based on then-current population  the ratio in per capita emissions between industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than 10 to 1 
including biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier regarding carbon sinks and land-use change  banuri et al   1996  pp 9394   the actual calculation of net emissions is very complex  and is affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of the climate system

changes since a particular base year  
see also 
between 19702004  global growth in annual co2 emissions was driven by north america  asia  and the middle east  the sharp acceleration in co2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3  increase per year  more than 2ppm per year  from 1.1  per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in
of both developing and developed nations  china was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period  localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the soviet union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more   made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported  in comparison  methane has not increased appreciably  and n

using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming  1718 this can be calculated by dividing a country s highest contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year  by that country s minimum contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year  choosing between different base years of 1750  1900  1950  and 1990 has a significant effect for most countries  1718 within the
group of countries  it is most significant for the uk  france and germany  these countries have a long history of co2 emissions  see the section on   
annual emissions  
per capita anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by country for the year 2000 including land-use change 
annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries  144 due to china s fast economic development  its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels of those in the
of the kyoto protocol  i e   the developed countries excluding the usa   other countries with fast growing emissions are   iran  and australia  which apart from the oil rich persian gulf states  now has the highest percapita emission rate in the world   on the other hand  annual per capita emissions of the eu-15 and the usa are gradually decreasing over time  emissions in russia and
have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in these countries 
energy statistics for fast growing economies are less accurate than those for the industrialized countries  for china s annual emissions in 2008  the
estimated an uncertainty range of about 10  
the   or greenhouse gas footprint  refers to the amount of ghg that are emitted during the creation of products or services  it is more comprehensive than the commonly used   which measures only carbon dioxide  one of many greenhouse gases 
2015 was the first year to see both total global economic growth and a reduction of carbon emissions 
top emitter countries

embedded emissions  
one way of attributing greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions is to measure the
 also referred to as  embodied emissions   of goods that are being consumed  emissions are usually measured according to production  rather than consumption  for example  in the main international
on climate change  the    countries report on emissions produced within their borders  e g   the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels  179 1 under a production-based accounting of emissions  embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting  rather than the importing  country  under a consumption-based accounting of emissions  embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country  rather than the exporting  country 
davis and caldeira  2010  4 found that a substantial proportion of co2 emissions are traded internationally  the net effect of trade was to export emissions from china and other emerging markets to consumers in the us  japan  and western europe  based on annual emissions data from the year 2004  and on a per-capita consumption basis  the top-5 emitting countries were found to be  in tco2 per person  per year   luxembourg  34.7   the us  22.0   singapore  20.2   australia  16.7   and canada  16.6   5 carbon trust research revealed that approximately 25  of all co2 emissions from human activities  flow   i e  are imported or exported  from one country to another  major developed economies were found to be typically net importers of embodied carbon emissions  with uk consumption emissions 34  higher than production emissions  and germany  29    japan  19   and the usa  13   also significant net importers of embodied emissions 
effect of policy  
see also 
governments have taken action to reduce ghg emissions     assessments of policy effectiveness have included work by the     and   policies implemented by governments have included national and regional targets to reduce emissions  promoting   and support for
such as solar energy as an effective use of renewable energy because solar uses energy from the sun and does not release pollutants into the air 
countries and regions listed in annex i of the
 unfccc   i e   the oecd and former planned economies of the soviet union  are required to submit periodic assessments to the unfccc of actions they are taking to address climate change  3 analysis by the unfccc  2011  8 suggested that policies and measures undertaken by annex i parties may have produced emission savings of 1.5 thousand
in the year 2010  with most savings made in the   the projected emissions saving of 1.5 thousand tg co2-eq is measured against a hypothetical    of annex i emissions  i e   projected annex i emissions in the absence of policies and measures  the total projected annex i saving of 1.5 thousand co2-eq does not include emissions savings in seven of the annex i parties  8
projections  
further information

a wide range of projections of future ghg emissions have been produced  rogner et al   2007  assessed the scientific literature on ghg projections  rogner et al   2007  concluded that unless energy policies changed substantially  the world would continue to depend on fossil fuels until 20252030  projections suggest that more than 80  of the world s energy will come from fossil fuels  this conclusion was based on  much evidence  and  high agreement  in the literature  projected annual energy-related co2 emissions in 2030 were 40110  higher than in 2000  with two-thirds of the increase originating in developing countries  projected annual per capita emissions in developed country regions remained substantially lower  2.85.1

removal from the atmosphere   sinks    
natural processes  
greenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes  as a consequence of 
a physical change  condensation and precipitation remove water vapor from the atmosphere  
a chemical reaction within the atmosphere  for example  methane is
by reaction with naturally occurring   oh and degraded to co2 and water vapor  co2 from the oxidation of methane is not included in the methane    other chemical reactions include solution and solid phase chemistry occurring in atmospheric aerosols 
a physical exchange between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet  an example is the mixing of atmospheric gases into the oceans 
a chemical change at the interface between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet  this is the case for co2  which is reduced by
of plants  and which  after dissolving in the oceans  reacts to form
and
and
ions  see

 halocarbons are generally too stable to disappear by chemical reaction in the atmosphere  
negative emissions  
main article 
a number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere  most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  either to geologic formations such as
and   or to the soil as in the case with   the ipcc has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change 
history of scientific research  
in the late 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that n
2 and o
2 do not absorb infrared radiation  called  at that time   dark radiation    while water  both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic droplets suspended in clouds  and co2 and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules do absorb infrared radiation  in the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made earth s overall temperature higher than it would be without them  during the late 20th century  a
evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system  with
