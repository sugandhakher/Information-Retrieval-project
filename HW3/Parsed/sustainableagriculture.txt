sustainable agriculture is
in
ways based on an understanding of   the study of relationships between organisms and their environment  it has been defined as  an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term   for example 
satisfy human food and fiber needs
enhance
and the
base upon which the agricultural economy depends
make the most efficient use of
and on-farm resources and integrate  where appropriate  natural biological cycles and controls
sustain the
of farm operations
enhance the
for farmers and society as a whole

history of the term  
the phrase was reportedly coined by the australian agricultural scientist   wes jackson is credited with the first publication of the expression in his 1980 book new roots for agriculture  the term became popularly used in the late 1980s 
farming and natural resources  
traditional farming methods had zero  
sustainable agriculture can be understood as an ecosystem approach to agriculture  practices that can cause long-term damage to
include excessive
of the soil  leading to   and
without adequate drainage  leading to   
have provided some of the best data on how various practices affect soil properties essential to sustainability  in the united states a federal agency  usda-natural resources conservation service  specializes in providing technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation and production agriculture as compatible goals 
the most important factors for an individual site are sun  air  soil    and   of the five  water and
and quantity are most amenable to human intervention through time and labor 
although air and sunlight are available everywhere on earth  crops also depend on soil nutrients and the availability of water  when farmers grow and harvest crops  they remove some of these nutrients from the soil  without replenishment  land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced   sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources  such as
 used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into synthetic fertilizer   or mineral ores  e g   phosphate   possible sources of nitrogen that would  in principle  be available indefinitely  include 
recycling crop waste and
or treated
growing
crops and s such as
or
that form symbioses with
called
industrial production of nitrogen by the
uses hydrogen  which is currently derived from natural gas  but this hydrogen could instead be made by
of water using electricity  perhaps from solar cells or windmills   or
genetically engineering  non-legume  crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts 
the last option was proposed in the 1970s  but is only recently   becoming feasible  sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs  phosphorus  potassium  etc   are more limited 
more realistic  and often overlooked  options include   returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands  returning lost nutrients indefinitely  such as the   the long-term use of   and use of crop and livestock
that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests  drought  or lack of nutrients 
crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner if certain fertilizer management practices are adhered to 
nationwide food producers require vast amounts of land and soil to produce food at an accelerated rate  this diminishes the nutrients in the soil and decimates the idea of sustainable agriculture  which is best built through local  regional agricultural methods   
water  
in some areas sufficient
is available for crop growth  but many other areas require   for irrigation systems to be sustainable  they require proper management  to avoid   and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable  otherwise  the water source effectively becomes a   improvements in water
technology and   combined with the development of
and low-pressure pivots  have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable  however  this progress has come at a price  in many areas  such as the   the water is being used faster than it can be replenished 
several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in  normal  years with average rainfall  these measures include both policy and management actions 
improving
and storage measures 
providing incentives for selection of
crop species 
using reduced-volume irrigation systems 
managing crops to reduce water loss  and
not planting crops at all 
indicators for sustainable water resource development are 
internal renewable water resources  this is the average annual flow of rivers and
generated from endogenous precipitation  after ensuring that there is no double counting  it represents the maximum amount of water resource produced within the boundaries of a country  this value  which is expressed as an average on a yearly basis  is invariant in time  except in the case of proved    the indicator can be expressed in three different units  in absolute terms  km yr   in mm yr  it is a measure of the
of the country   and as a function of population  m person per year  
global renewable water resources  this is the sum of internal renewable water resources and incoming flow originating outside the country  unlike internal resources  this value can vary with time if upstream development reduces
at the border  treaties ensuring a specific flow to be reserved from upstream to downstream countries may be taken into account in the computation of global water resources in both countries 
dependency ratio  this is the proportion of the global renewable water resources originating outside the country  expressed in percentage  it is an expression of the level to which the water resources of a country depend on neighbouring countries 
water withdrawal  in view of the limitations described above  only gross water withdrawal can be computed systematically on a country basis as a measure of water use  absolute or per-person value of yearly water withdrawal gives a measure of the importance of water in the country s economy  when expressed in percentage of water resources  it shows the degree of pressure on water resources  a rough estimate shows that if water withdrawal exceeds a quarter of global renewable water resources of a country  water can be considered a limiting factor to development and  reciprocally  the pressure on water resources can affect all sectors  from agriculture to environment and fisheries 
soil  
walls built to avoid water run-off
is fast becoming one of the world s severe problems  it is estimated that  more than a thousand million tonnes of southern africa s soil are eroded every year  experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates   soil erosion is not unique to africa but is occurring worldwide  the phenomenon is being called peak soil as present large-scale factory farming techniques are jeopardizing humanity s ability to grow food in the present and in the future  without efforts to improve soil management practices  the availability of
will become increasingly problematic 
some soil management techniques
growing
to hold the soil
back into fields
stop using
 which contain salt 
protecting soil from water run-off  soil erosion 
phosphate  
phosphate is a primary component in the chemical fertilizer which is applied in modern agricultural production  however  scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50100 years and that
will occur in about 2030  the phenomenon of peak phosphorus is expected to increase food prices as fertilizer costs increase as rock phosphate reserves become more difficult to extract  in the long term  phosphate will therefore have to be recovered and recycled from human and animal waste in order to maintain food production 
land  
as the global population increases and demand for food increases  there is pressure on land resources  land can also be considered a finite resource on earth  expansion of agricultural land decreases
and contributes to   the
of the united nations estimates that in coming decades  cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development  along with reclamation of wetlands  and conversion of forest to cultivation  resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion 
energy for agriculture  
main article 
energy is used all the way down the food chain from farm to fork  in industrial agriculture  energy is used in on-farm mechanisation  food processing  storage  and transportation processes  it has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices  oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals  higher prices of non-renewable energy resources are projected by the   increased energy prices as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted may therefore decrease global food security unless action is taken to  decouple  fossil fuel energy from food production  with a move towards  energy-smart  agricultural systems  the use of solar powered irrigation in
has come to be recognized as a leading example of energy use in creating a closed system for water irrigation in agricultural activity 
economics  
socioeconomic aspects of sustainability are also partly understood  regarding less concentrated farming  the best known analysis is netting s study on smallholder systems through history  the
defines sustainability in this context in a much broader form  considering effect on all stakeholders in a 360 degree approach
given the finite supply of
at any specific cost and location  agriculture that is inefficient or damaging to needed resources may eventually exhaust the available resources or the ability to afford and acquire them  it may also generate negative   such as pollution as well as financial and production costs  there are several studies incooperating these negative externalities in an economic analysis concerning ecosystem services  biodiversity  land degradation and   these include the
study led by pavan sukhdev and the
which seeks to establish an economic cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture 
the way that crops are
must be accounted for in the sustainability  
sold locally does not require additional energy for transportation  including consumers   food sold at a remote location  whether at a
or the   incurs a different set of energy cost for materials    and  
pursuing sustainable agriculture results in many localized benefits  having the opportunities to sell products directly to consumers  rather than at wholesale or commodity prices  allows farmers to bring in optimal profit 
methods  
polyculture practices in
what grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice  two of the many possible practices of sustainable agriculture are
and   both designed to ensure that crops being cultivated can obtain the necessary
for healthy growth  soil amendments would include using locally available compost from community recycling centers  these community recycling centers help produce the compost needed by the local organic farms 
using community recycling from yard and kitchen waste utilizes a local area s commonly available resources  these resources in the past were thrown away into large waste disposal sites  are now used to produce low cost organic compost for organic farming  other practices includes growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field  each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources  this system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil 
from legumes  for example  used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth  helps to allow the land to be reused annually  legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate  and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest 
rotational grazing practices in use with paddocks
  a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field  is a very widespread practice  but there are questions about its sustainability  especially if the same crop is grown every year  today it is realized to get around this problem local cities and farms can work together to produce the needed compost for the farmers around them  this combined with growing a mixture of crops    sometimes reduces disease or pest problems but polyculture has rarely  if ever  been compared to the more widespread practice of growing different crops in successive years    with the same overall   cropping systems that include a variety of crops  polyculture and or rotation  may also replenish nitrogen  if
are included  and may also use resources such as sunlight  water  or nutrients more efficiently  field crops res  34 239  
replacing a natural ecosystem with a few specifically chosen plant varieties reduces the genetic diversity found in wildlife and makes the organisms susceptible to widespread   the
is a well-known example of the dangers of   in practice  there is no single approach to sustainable agriculture  as the precise goals and methods must be adapted to each individual case  there may be some techniques of farming that are inherently in conflict with the concept of sustainability  but there is widespread misunderstanding on effects of some practices  today the growth of local farmers  markets offer small farms the ability to sell the products that they have grown back to the cities that they got the recycled compost from  by using local recycling this will help move people away from the
techniques that are the characteristic feature of
are often cited as inherently destructive  yet slash-and-burn cultivation has been practiced in the amazon for at least 6000 years  serious deforestation did not begin until the 1970s  largely as the result of brazilian government programs and policies  to note that it may not have been slash-and-burn so much as   which with the addition of organic matter produces   one of the richest soils on earth and the only one that regenerates itself 
there are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry  some of the key tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called   lowering stock density  and moving the stock between paddocks frequently 
sustainable intensification  
main article 
in light of concerns about  
growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture  sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high   while maintaining
and   the capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of synthetic  non renewable inputs whilst maintaining or even boosting yields has been the subject of much debate  recent work in the globally important irrigated rice production system of east asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70  whilst delivering a 5  yield advantage compared with standard practice    
soil treatment  
with a msd moeschle steam boiler  left side 
can be used as an ecological alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization  different methods are available to induce steam into the soil in order to kill pests and increase soil health 
solarizing is based on the same principle  used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests 
certain crops act as natural biofumigants  releasing pest suppressing compounds  mustard  radishes  and other plants in the brassica family are best known for this effect  there exist varieties of mustard shown to be almost as effective as synthetic fumigants at a similar or lesser cost 
off-farm impacts  
a farm that is able to  produce perpetually   yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture  an example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is over-application of synthetic
or animal   which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters     the other extreme can also be undesirable  as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to
destruction  as in the case of
farming for livestock feed in asia  specific land for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder  cereals productions lands for some cash crops and even recycling of related food crops in some cases even a small unit of aquaculture is also included in this number  aari-1996 
sustainability affects overall production  which must increase to meet the increasing food and fiber requirements as the world s human population expands to a projected 9.3 billion people by   increased production may come from creating new farmland  which may
carbon dioxide emissions if done through reclamation of desert as in
and   or may worsen emissions if done through
farming  as in  
international policy  
sustainable agriculture has become a topic of interest in the international policy arena  especially with regards to its potential to reduce the risks associated with a changing climate and growing human population 
the   as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change  urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy  the commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields  necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience  it also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade  including in national research and development budgets  land rehabilitation  economic incentives  and infrastructure improvement 
urban planning  
there has been considerable debate about which form of human residential habitat may be a better social form for sustainable agriculture 
many environmentalists advocate urban developments with high population density as a way of preserving agricultural land and maximizing energy efficiency  however  others have theorized that sustainable   or
which combine habitation and farming with close proximity between producers and consumers  may provide greater sustainability   
the use of available city space  e g         and other forms of   for cooperative food production is another way to achieve greater sustainability   
one of the latest ideas in achieving sustainable agriculture involves shifting the production of food plants from major factory farming operations to large  urban  technical facilities called vertical farms  the advantages of
include year-round production  isolation from pests and diseases  controllable resource recycling  and on-site production that reduces transportation costs    while a vertical farm has yet to become a reality  the idea is gaining momentum among those who believe that current sustainable farming methods will be insufficient to provide for a growing global population 
criticism  
efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community  however  these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end  some foresee a true sustainable
that may be very different from today s  greatly reduced energy usage  minimal   fewer  
with   little   more home and   etc  agriculture would be very different in this type of sustainable economy
