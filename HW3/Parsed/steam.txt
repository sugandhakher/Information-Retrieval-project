types of steam and conversions  
steam is traditionally created by heating a boiler via burning coal and other fuels  but it is also possible to create steam with solar energy  water vapor that includes water droplets is described as wet steam  as wet steam is heated further  the droplets evaporate  and at a high enough temperature  which depends on the pressure  all of the water evaporates and the system is in  
is steam at a temperature higher than its
for the pressure  which only occurs where all liquid water has evaporated or has been removed from the system 
contain thermodynamic data for water steam and are often used by engineers and scientists in design and operation of equipment where thermodynamic cycles involving steam are used  additionally  thermodynamic

uses  
agricultural  
in   steam is used for
to avoid the use of harmful chemical agents and increase soil health 
domestic  
steam s capacity to transfer heat is also used in the home  for cooking vegetables  steam cleaning of fabric  carpets and flooring  and for heating buildings  in each case  water is heated in a boiler  and the steam carries the energy to a target object  steam is also used in ironing clothes to add enough humidity with the heat to take wrinkles out and put intentional creases into the clothing 
electricity generation  and cogeneration   
about 90  of all electricity is
using steam as the   nearly all by  
in electric generation  steam is typically condensed at the end of its expansion cycle  and returned to the boiler for re-use  however  in   steam is piped into buildings through a
system to provide heat energy after its use in the electric generation cycle  the world s biggest steam generation system is the   which pumps steam into 100,000 buildings in
from seven cogeneration plants

despite the resemblance to a boiler  note the lack of a chimney and also how the cylinders are at the cab end  not the chimney end 
in other industrial applications steam is used for   which is introduced and extracted by heat transfer  usually through pipes  steam is a capacious reservoir for thermal energy because of water s high

lifting gas  
owing to its low molecular mass  steam is an effective   providing approximately 60  as much lift as helium and twice as much as hot air  it is not flammable  unlike hydrogen  and is cheap and abundant  unlike helium  the required heat  however  leads to condensation problems and requires an insulated envelope  these factors have limited its use thus far to mostly demonstration projects

use the expansion of steam to drive a
or
to perform   the ability to return condensed steam as water-liquid to the boiler at high pressure with relatively little expenditure of pumping power is important 
of steam to water often occurs at the low-pressure end of a steam turbine  since this maximizes the   but such wet-steam conditions must be limited to avoid excessive turbine blade erosion  engineers use an idealised   the   to model the behavior of steam engines  steam turbines are often used in the production of electricity 
sterilization  
an   which uses steam under pressure  is used in microbiology laboratories and similar environments for  
steam  especially dry  highly superheated  steam  may be used for antimicrobial cleaning even to the levels of sterilization  steam is a non-toxic antimicrobial agent 
steam in piping  
steam is used in
for utility lines  it is also used in jacketing and tracing of piping to maintain the uniform temperature in pipelines and vessels   
wood treatment  
steam is used in the process of wood bending  killing insects and increasing plasticity   
concrete treatment  
steam is used to accentuate drying especially in prefabricates    care should be taken since concrete produces heat during hydration and additional heat from the steam could be detrimental to hardening reaction processes of the concrete   
cleaning  
used in cleaning of fibers and other materials  sometimes in preparation for painting  steam is also useful in melting hardened grease and oil residues  so it is useful in cleaning kitchen floors and equipment and internal combustion engines and parts  among the advantages of using steam versus a hot water spray are the facts that steam can operate at higher temperatures and it uses substantially less water per minute
