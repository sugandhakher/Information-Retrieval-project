first successful geothermal test boring in indonesia at kawah kamojang in 1926
geothermal power in indonesia is an increasingly significant source of   as a result of its
geology  it is often reported that
has 40  of the world s potential   estimated at 28,000
 mw  
currently indonesia is the world s third largest
producer after the
and the   installed production capacity  2011  is almost 1,200mw from six geothermal fields in   north
and north   in 2007  geothermal energy represented 1.9  of the country s total energy supply and 3.7  of its electric power 
at the
in   president
announced a plan to build 44 new geothermal plants by 2014  more than tripling capacity to 4,000mw  by 2025  indonesia aims to produce more than 9,000mw of geothermal power  becoming the world s leading geothermal energy producer  this would account for 5  of indonesia s total energy needs 
a detailed report on the geothermal sector in indonesia issued in 2015 by the asian development bank and world bank    indicated that reforms in key areas of policy were likely to be needed to stimulate sustained expansion in the sector

history  
the first proposal on energy from volcanoes came in 1918 during the   in 1926  five test borings were drilled in java s
field  the third being the first that was successful  in the early 1980s  it was still discharging superheated steam from a depth of 66 metres at a temperature of 140c and a pressure of 3.5 to 4   a prefeasibility study for electricity generation was initiated in 1972 by geothermal energy new zealand  the first generator was inaugurated in 1983 by president
and subsequently expanded in 1987  current capacity is 140mw 
since the mid-1980s    the world s largest geothermal power producer  has operated two geothermal fields in west java at
and darajat with a combined capacity of around 365mw  between 1989 and 1997 explorations were conducted at the
geothermal field in northern sumatra  and subsequently a 12mw plant has been placed in operation 
in 1991  the indonesia geothermal association  asosiasi panasbumi indonesia - api   a non-governmental organisation  was established to promote geothermal energy  it has approximately 500 members including geothermal experts  companies  and stakeholders  the
in   owned by british   has been in operation since 2000  it currently comprises two units with a total capacity of 227mw  there are plans for a third unit of 127mw which is expected to be on-stream by mid-2013 
exploration and development  
exploration of the
geothermal field in
started in 1974 and though production capacity was estimated at 175mw in 2008  the project is on hold after being opposed by local residents 
at the
in bali  several companies were awarded the rights to develop geothermal fields and power plants  golden spike indonesia won the tender to develop a power plant at
in central java  sokoria geothermal indonesia gained rights to develop a plant at   on
island  while supreme energy was chosen to develop plants at
in lampung and
in west sumatra  these projects were estimated to require a total investment of us 1.68 billion 
as of 2010  a total of 265 potential sites for plants have been identified across the country  development of the industry  however  involves a range of complex policy issues  some of which are proving to be a continuing source of controversy  in mid-2011  for example  the indonesian government issued an expected regulation providing certain guarantees for investors with the aim of encouraging increased investment in the geothermal sector  however  investor response was guarded  suggesting that key aspects had not been addressed in the regulation 
in late 2013  pt pertamina geothermal energy  pge  -- a geothermal business branch of state oil and gas company said that it planned to develop eight new geothermal plants with a total capacity of 655mw  expected to require  2.0 bn of new investments   these included 
110 mw at ulubelu in
110 mw at
in south sumatra
40 mw at lahendong
30 mw at karaha
35 mw at
110 mw at hululais
110 mw at sungai penuh
of these  several were to be financed with loans from
and  
in addition  work is starting on the sarulla geothermal plant in north sumatra with a total planned capacity of 320 mw  the plant has been on the books since the early 1990s but development was stalled over various issues  the plant  expected to cost around  1.65 billion  will be built with financial support from the
along with the
and other lenders 
installed capacity  
according to the renewable energy policy network s renewables 2013 global status report  indonesia has the third largest installed generating capacity in the world in the geothermal sector  with 1.3 gw installed capacity  indonesia trails only the united states  3.4 gw  and the philippines  1.9 gw   however it leads mexico  1.0 gw   italy  0.9 gw   new zealand  0.8 gw   iceland  0.7 gw   and japan  0.5 gw  
recent developments  
in recent years  the indonesian government has announced plans for two  fast-track  increases in the total capacity of indonesia s electricity generation network of 10,000mw each  under the second 10,000mw fast-track plan it was forecast that a relatively large share of 3,970mw would be installed in geothermal plants  but under the first 10,000mw fast-track plan  investment in the geothermal sector appears to be lagging 
september 2011  the indonesian state-owned electricity utility
 pln  announced that the outlook was that by 2014 only 1,200mw of power was likely to be produced from geothermal plants  the then-president director of the pln    said that plans to develop a number of geothermal plants were behind schedule because private sector investors were reluctant to invest as a result of the perceived risks in the sector 
july 2012  a senior official from the pln reported that there were 13 geothermal power plants that were still stuck in the exploration stages and were likely to miss development deadlines  problems mentioned included disappointing results at drilling sites  lack of adequate supporting infrastructure  mainly roads   and difficulties that firms faced in obtaining required permits for their activities from the forestry department and local governments 
june 2013  the first international geothermal conference and exhibition was held in indonesia  the relatively slow development of the sector attracted comment  the minister for energy and mineral resources announced that the prices to be paid for energy supplied by geothermal suppliers would be increased to encourage activity in the sector  speaking at the conference  the indonesian vice president
called for changes in policy to speed up development 
june 2013  work on a significant geothermal project in
in south sumatra  planned size  220mw  was suspended following local protests  local villagers in the
area claimed that development of the project would damage the social structure of the community  the forestry minister    sided with the local community saying that the company developing the site  pt supreme energy  would need to convince the local villagers of the safety of the project  in response  the chair of the indonesian geothermal association said that the government should shut all geothermal projects if top officials were  half-hearted  in their commitment to investors 
august 2014  the indonesian parliament approved a new geothermal law aimed at facilitating development in the sector  key points of the new law included the following   a  geothermal activities would no longer be considered mining activities  development of geothermal resources can be carried out in forest conservation areas  under the existing forestry law  mining operations are prohibited in protected forests   b  tenders for geothermal projects will be called by the central government instead of by local administrations   c  new geothermal projects will be developed under new  more favorable  pricing arrangements   d  local administrations will receive a portion of the revenues derived from geothermal resources   e  quite detailed provisions were set out regarding such things as surveys of geothermal sites  exploration  tendering procedures  the size of working areas  arrangements for determining prices and administrative sanctions  obligations of the holders of geothermal licenses  and so on 
policy issues  
expansion in the sector appears to be being held back by a range of factors including an uncertain regulatory environment  including  especially  uncertainty over land laws  and the perceived risks of development  the indonesian government s plans for development of the geothermal sector rely largely on private sector investment  but numerous reports indicate that private sector investors are concerned about a range of risks including technical  geological  risks  regulatory risks stemming from uncertain government policy  and financial risks arising from the pricing policies determined by the indonesian government  there is disagreement within the indonesian government as to who should bear these risks  policy makers in the power sector  with an eye to meeting the government s official investment targets  are often inclined to the view that at least some of the risks should be borne by the indonesian government through the national budget managed by the ministry of finance  official policy from the ministry of finance has traditionally been cautious  resisting the suggestion that unspecified risks should be borne by the indonesian budget 
in response to reports about certain of the risks that private sector investors were concerned about  in mid-2011 the government issued a regulation intended to provide guarantees that the state electricity utility pln would meet financial obligations to independent power producers  ipps  who invested in the geothermal sector  but the regulation was quickly criticised by representatives of private investors as being too limited and for failing to clarify important concerns 
pricing policy
prices have been another important policy issue in the sector  in an effort to encourage private sector investment  the indonesian government has been establishing a
scheme by instructing state electricity utility pln to purchase power from geothermal projects at various rates ranging from around 6.5 us cents to over 12 us cents per kwh  the government is also preparing a regulation that is expected to specify the price that the pln must purchase power from geothermal plans in the second 10,000mw fast-track electricity sector program which the government has announced  this regulation is expected to be finalised by early 2012 
environmental issues  
according to the ministry of forestry  around 80  of geothermal reserves are located in designated conserved forest areas  the 2009 mineral and coal mining law lists geothermal exploration as a mining activity so a presidential decree would be required to allow geothermal activities conserved forest areas  according to the ministry  geothermal mining is unlikely to cause environmental harm  in may 2011 the indonesian government imposed a two-year moratorium on logging  however this excepts the energy sector  including geothermal activities
