a high-voltage  direct current  hvdc 
system  also called a power super highway or an electrical super highway  uses
for the bulk transmission of electrical power  in contrast with the more common
 ac  systems  for long-distance transmission  hvdc systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses  for   hvdc avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable
each cycle  for shorter distances  the higher cost of dc conversion equipment compared to an ac system may still be justified  due to other benefits of direct current links 
hvdc allows power transmission between
ac transmission systems  since the power flow through an hvdc link can be controlled independently of the phase angle between source and load  it can stabilize a network against disturbances due to rapid changes in power  hvdc also allows transfer of power between grid systems running at different frequencies  such as 50hz and 60hz  this improves the stability and economy of each grid  by allowing exchange of power between incompatible networks 
the modern form of hvdc transmission uses technology developed extensively in the 1930s in
   and in   early commercial installations included one in the

and   and a 100kv  20mw system between

high voltage transmission  
is used for
transmission to reduce the energy lost in the
of the wires  for a given quantity of power transmitted  doubling the voltage will deliver the same power at only half the current  since the power lost as heat in the wires is proportional to the square of the current for a given conductor size  or inversely proportional to the square of the voltage  doubling the voltage reduces the line losses per unit of electrical power delivered by a factor of 4  while power lost in transmission can also be reduced by increasing the conductor size  larger conductors are heavier and more expensive 
high voltage cannot readily be used for lighting or motors  so transmission-level voltages must be reduced for end-use equipment 
are used to change the voltage levels in
 ac  transmission circuits  because transformers made voltage changes practical  and ac generators were more efficient than those using dc  ac became dominant after the introduction of practical systems of distribution in europe in 1891 and the conclusion in 1892 of the   a competition being fought on many fronts in the us between the dc system of
and the ac system of  
practical conversion of power between ac and dc became possible with the development of
devices such as

the first long-distance transmission of electric power was demonstrated using direct current in 1882 at   but only 1.5kw was transmitted  an early method of high-voltage dc transmission was developed by the swiss engineer
and his method was put into practice by 1889 in
by the acquedotto de ferrari-galliera company  this system used series-connected
sets to increase the voltage  each set was insulated from
and driven by insulated shafts from a   the transmission line was operated in a  constant current  mode  with up to 5,000 volts across each machine  some machines having double
to reduce the voltage on each commutator  this system transmitted 630kw at 14kv dc over a distance of 120km  the
system transmitted 8,600kw of hydroelectric power a distance of 200km  including 10km of underground cable  this system used eight series-connected generators with dual commutators for a total voltage of 150,000 volts between the positive and negative poles  and operated from c 1906 until 1936  fifteen thury systems were in operation by 1913  other thury systems operating at up to 100kv dc worked into the 1930s  but the rotating machinery required high maintenance and had high energy loss  various other
were tested during the first half of the 20th century with little commercial success 
one technique attempted for conversion of direct current from a high transmission voltage to lower utilization voltage was to charge series-connected   then reconnect the batteries in parallel to serve distribution loads  while at least two commercial installations were tried around the turn of the 20th century  the technique was not generally useful owing to the limited capacity of batteries  difficulties in switching between series and parallel connections  and the inherent energy inefficiency of a battery charge discharge cycle 
mercury arc valves  
first proposed in 1914  the grid controlled
became available for power transmission during the period 1920 to 1940  starting in 1932 
tested mercury-vapor valves and a 12kv dc transmission line  which also served to convert 40hz generation to serve 60hz loads  at   in 1941  a 60mw  200kv  115km buried cable link was designed for the city of
using mercury arc valves     but owing to the collapse of the german government in 1945 the project was never completed  the nominal justification for the project was that  during wartime  a buried cable would be less conspicuous as a bombing target  the equipment was moved to the
and was put into service there as the moscowkashira hvdc system  the moscowkashira system and the 1954 connection by  s group at
between the mainland of sweden and the island of gotland marked the beginning of the modern era of hvdc transmission 
mercury arc valves require an external circuit to force the current to zero and thus turn off the valve  in hvdc applications  the ac power system itself provides the means of commutating the current to another valve in the converter  consequently  converters built with mercury arc valves are known as line-commutated converters  lcc   lccs require rotating synchronous machines in the ac systems to which they are connected  making power transmission into a passive load impossible 
mercury arc valves were common in systems designed up to 1972  the last mercury arc hvdc system  the
in     having been put into service in stages between 1972 and 1977  since then  all mercury arc systems have been either shut down or converted to use solid state devices  the last hvdc system to use mercury arc valves was the
between the north and south islands of new zealand  which used them on one of its two poles  the mercury arc valves were decommissioned on 1 august 2012  ahead of commissioning of replacement thyristor converters 
thyristor valves  
since 1977  new hvdc systems have used only   in most cases
valves  like mercury arc valves  thyristors require connection to an external ac circuit in hvdc applications to turn them on and off  hvdc using thyristor valves is also known as line-commutated converter  lcc  hvdc 
development of thyristor valves for hvdc began in the late 1960s  the first complete hvdc scheme based on thyristor valves was the
scheme in canada  which was built by
and went into service in 1972 
on march 15  1979  a 1920mw thyristor based direct current connection between
and
 1,410km  was energised  the conversion equipment was built in 1974 by   and
and
were partners in the project  the late completion date a result of the civil war    the transmission voltage of 533kv was the highest in the world at the time 
capacitor-commutated converters  ccc   
line-commutated converters have some limitations in their use for hvdc systems  this results from requiring the ac circuit to turn off the thyristor current and the need for a short period of  reverse  voltage to effect the turn-off  turn-off time   an attempt to address these limitations is the capacitor-commutated converter  ccc  which has been used in a small number of hvdc systems  the ccc differs from a conventional hvdc system in that it has series
inserted into the ac line connections  either on the primary or secondary side of the converter transformer  the series capacitors partially offset the commutating inductance of the converter and help to reduce fault currents  this also allows a smaller extinction angle to be used with a converter inverter  reducing the need for
support  however  ccc has remained only a niche application because of the advent of voltage-source converters  vsc  which completely eliminate the need for an extinction  turn-off  time 
voltage-source converters  vsc   
widely used in
since the 1980s  voltage-source converters started to appear in hvdc in 1997 with the experimental
project in sweden  by the end of 2011  this technology had captured a significant proportion of the hvdc market 
the development of higher rated
 igbts  
 gtos  and
 igcts   has made smaller hvdc systems economical  the manufacturer
calls this concept hvdc light  while
calls a similar concept hvdc plus  power link universal system  and
call their product based upon this technology hvdc maxsine  they have extended the use of hvdc down to blocks as small as a few tens of megawatts and lines as short as a few score kilometres of overhead line  there are several different variants of vsc technology  most installations built until 2012 use
in a circuit that is effectively an ultra-high-voltage motor drive  current installations  including hvdc plus and hvdc maxsine  are based on variants of a converter called a modular multi-level converter  mmc  
multilevel converters have the advantage that they allow
filtering equipment to be reduced or eliminated altogether  by way of comparison  ac harmonic filters of typical line-commutated converter stations cover nearly half of the converter station area 
with time  voltage-source converter systems will probably replace all installed simple thyristor-based systems  including the highest dc power transmission applications 
advantages of hvdc over ac transmission  
a long distance point to point hvdc transmission scheme generally has lower overall investment cost and lower losses than an equivalent ac transmission scheme  hvdc conversion equipment at the terminal stations is costly  but the total dc transmission line costs over long distances are lower than ac line of the same distance  hvdc requires less conductor per unit distance than an ac line  as there is no need to support three phases and there is no  
depending on voltage level and construction details  hvdc transmission losses are quoted as about 3.5  per 1,000km  which are 30  40  less than with ac lines  at the same voltage levels  this is because direct current transfers only active power and thus causes lower losses than alternating current  which transfers both active and reactive power 
hvdc transmission may also be selected for other technical benefits  hvdc can transfer power between separate ac networks  hvdc powerflow between separate ac systems can be automatically controlled to support either network during transient conditions  but without the risk that a major
in one network will lead to a collapse in the second  hvdc improves on system controllability  with at least one hvdc link embedded in an ac gridin the deregulated environment  the controllability feature is particularly useful where control of energy trading is needed 
the combined economic and technical benefits of hvdc transmission can make it a suitable choice for connecting electricity sources that are located far away from the main users 
specific applications where hvdc transmission technology provides benefits include 
transmission schemes  e g   250km
between
and   the 580km
cable between norway and the   and 290km
between the australian mainland and   
endpoint-to-endpoint long-haul bulk power transmission without intermediate  taps   usually to connect a remote generating plant to the main grid  for example the
in  
increasing the capacity of an existing
in situations where additional wires are difficult or expensive to install 
power transmission and stabilization between unsynchronised ac networks  with the extreme example being an ability to transfer power between countries that use ac at different frequencies  since such transfer can occur in either direction  it increases the stability of both networks by allowing them to draw on each other in emergencies and failures 
stabilizing a predominantly ac power-grid  without increasing fault levels    
integration of renewable resources such as wind into the main transmission grid  hvdc overhead lines for onshore wind integration projects and hvdc cables for offshore projects have been proposed in north america and europe for both technical and economic reasons  dc grids with multiple voltage-source converters  vscs  are one of the technical solutions for pooling offshore wind energy and transmitting it to load centers located far away onshore 
cable systems  
long undersea   underground
have a high electrical
compared with overhead transmission lines  since the live conductors within the cable are surrounded by a relatively thin layer of insulation  the    and a metal sheath  the geometry is that of a long co-axial   the total capacitance increases with the length of the cable  this capacitance is in a
with the load  where alternating current is used for cable transmission  additional current must flow in the cable to charge this cable capacitance  this extra current flow causes added energy loss via dissipation of heat in the conductors of the cable  raising its temperature  additional energy losses also occur as a result of
losses in the cable insulation 
however  if direct current is used  the cable capacitance is charged only when the cable is first energized or if the voltage level changes  there is no additional current required  for a sufficiently long ac cable  the entire current-carrying ability of the conductor would be needed to supply the charging current alone  this cable
issue limits the length and power carrying ability of ac powered cables  dc powered cables are limited only by their temperature rise and   although some leakage current flows through the dielectric   this is small compared to the cable s rated current 
overhead line systems  
the capacitive effect of long underground or undersea cables in ac transmission applications also applies to ac overhead lines  although to a much lesser extent  nevertheless  for a long ac overhead transmission line  the current flowing just to charge the line capacitance can be significant  and this reduces the capability of the line to carry useful current to the load at the remote end  another factor that reduces the useful current carrying ability of ac lines is the   which causes a non-uniform distribution of current over the cross-sectional area of the conductor  transmission line conductors operating with direct current do not suffer from either of these constraints  therefore  for the same conductor losses  or heating effect   a given conductor can carry more current to the load when operating with hvdc than ac 
finally  depending upon the environmental conditions and the performance of overhead line insulation operating with hvdc  it may be possible for a given transmission line to operate with a constant hvdc voltage that is approximately the same as the peak ac voltage for which it is designed and insulated  the power delivered in an ac system is defined by the
 rms  of an ac voltage  but rms is only about 71  of the peak voltage  therefore  if the hvdc line can operate continuously with an hvdc voltage that is the same as the peak voltage of the ac equivalent line  then for a given current  where hvdc current is the same as the rms current in the ac line   the power transmission capability when operating with hvdc is approximately 40  higher than the capability when operating with ac 
asynchronous connections  
because hvdc allows power transmission between unsynchronized ac distribution systems  it can help increase system stability  by preventing
from propagating from one part of a wider power transmission grid to another  changes in load that would cause portions of an ac network to become unsynchronized and to separate  would not similarly affect a dc link  and the power flow through the dc link would tend to stabilize the ac network  the magnitude and direction of power flow through a dc link can be directly controlled  and changed as needed to support the ac networks at either end of the dc link  this has caused many power system operators to contemplate wider use of hvdc technology for its stability benefits alone 
disadvantages  
the disadvantages of hvdc are in conversion  switching  control  availability and maintenance 
hvdc is less reliable and has lower
than alternating current  ac  systems  mainly due to the extra conversion equipment  single-pole systems have availability of about 98.5   with about a third of the downtime unscheduled due to faults  fault-tolerant bipole systems provide high availability for 50  of the link capacity  but availability of the full capacity is about 97  to 98  
the required
are expensive and have limited overload capacity  at smaller transmission distances  the losses in the converter stations may be bigger than in an ac transmission line for the same distance  the cost of the converters may not be offset by reductions in line construction cost and lower line loss 
operating a hvdc scheme requires many spare parts to be kept  often exclusively for one system  as hvdc systems are less standardized than ac systems and technology changes faster 
in contrast to ac systems  realizing multiterminal systems is complex  especially with line commutated converters   as is expanding existing schemes to multiterminal systems  controlling power flow in a multiterminal dc system requires good communication between all the terminals  power flow must be actively regulated by the converter control system instead of relying on the inherent impedance and phase angle properties of an ac transmission line  multi-terminal systems are rare  as of 2012 only two are in service  the
between radisson  sandy pond and nicolet and the
link which was modified in 1989 to also provide power to the island of corsica 
high-voltage dc circuit breaker  
hvdc
are difficult to build because some mechanism must be included in the circuit breaker to force current to zero  otherwise
and contact wear would be too great to allow reliable switching  in november 2012  abb announced development of the world s first hvdc circuit breaker 
the abb breaker contains four switching elements  two mechanical  one high-speed and one low-speed  and two semiconductor  one high-voltage and one low-voltage   normally  power flows through the low-speed mechanical switch  the high-speed mechanical switch and the low-voltage semiconductor switch  the last two switches are
by the high-voltage semiconductor switch 
initially  all switches are closed  on   because the high-voltage semiconductor switch has much greater resistance than the mechanical switch plus the low-voltage semiconductor switch  current flow through it is low  to disconnect  first the low-voltage semiconductor switch opens  this diverts the current through the high-voltage semiconductor switch  because of its relatively high resistance  it begins heating very rapidly  then the high-speed mechanical switch is opened  unlike the low-voltage semiconductor switch  which is capable of standing off only the
of the closed high-voltage semiconductor switch  this one is capable of standing off the full voltage  because no current is flowing through this switch when it opens  it is not damaged by arcing  then  the high-voltage semiconductor switch is opened  this actually cuts the power  however  it is not quite 100  off  a final low-speed mechanical switch disconnects the residual current 
costs of high voltage dc transmission  
generally  providers of hvdc systems  such as  
and   do not specify cost details of particular projects  it may be considered a commercial matter between the provider and the client 
costs vary widely depending on the specifics of the project  such as power rating  circuit length  overhead vs  cabled route  land costs  and ac network improvements required at either terminal   a detailed comparison of dc vs  ac transmission costs may be required in situations where there is no clear technical advantage to dc  and economical reasoning alone drives the selection 
however  some practitioners have provided some information 
for an 8gw 40km link laid under the   the following are approximate primary equipment costs for a 2000mw 500kv bipolar conventional hvdc link  exclude way-leaving  on-shore reinforcement works  consenting  engineering  insurance  etc  
converter stations  110m   120m or  173.7m 
subsea cable   installation  1m km   1.2m or   1.6m km 
so for an 8gw capacity between
and
in four links  little is left over from 750m for the installed works  add another 200300m for the other works depending on additional onshore works required 
an april 2010 announcement for a 2,000 mw  64km line between spain and france is estimated at 700million  this includes the cost of a tunnel through the pyrenees 
the conversion process  
converter  
main article 
at the heart of an   the equipment which performs the conversion between ac and dc is referred to as the converter  almost all hvdc converters are inherently capable of converting from ac to dc    and from dc to ac     although in many hvdc systems  the system as a whole is optimised for power flow in only one direction  irrespective of how the converter itself is designed  the station which is operating  at a given time  with power flow from ac to dc is referred to as the rectifier and the station which is operating with power flow from dc to ac is referred to as the inverter 
early hvdc systems used electromechanical conversion  the thury system  but all hvdc systems built since the 1940s have used electronic  static  converters  electronic converters for hvdc are divided into two main categories 
line-commutated converters  lcc 
voltage-sourced converters  or current-source converters 
line-commutated converters  
most of the hvdc systems in operation today are based on line-commutated converters 
the basic lcc configuration uses a three-phase
or six-pulse bridge  containing six electronic switches  each connecting one of the three phases to one of the two dc rails  a complete switching element is usually referred to as a valve  irrespective of its construction  however  with a phase change only every 60  considerable
is produced at both the dc and ac terminals when this arrangement is used 
a twelve-pulse bridge rectifier
an enhancement of this arrangement uses 12 valves in a twelve-pulse bridge  the ac is split into two separate three phase supplies before transformation  one of the sets of supplies is then configured to have a star  wye  secondary  the other a delta secondary  establishing a 30 phase difference between the two sets of three phases  with twelve valves connecting each of the two sets of three phases to the two dc rails  there is a phase change every 30  and harmonics are considerably reduced  for this reason the twelve-pulse system has become standard on most line-commutated converter hvdc systems built since the 1970s 
with line commutated converters  the converter has only one degree of freedom  the firing angle  which represents the time delay between the voltage across a valve becoming positive  at which point the valve would start to conduct if it were made from diodes  and the thyristors being turned on  the dc output voltage of the converter steadily becomes less positive as the firing angle is increased  firing angles of up to 90 correspond to rectification and result in positive dc voltages  while firing angles above 90 correspond to inversion and result in negative dc voltages  the practical upper limit for the firing angle is about 150160 because above this  the valve would have insufficient turn-off time 
early lcc systems used   which were rugged but required high maintenance  because of this  many mercury-arc hvdc systems were built with bypass switchgear across each six-pulse bridge so that the hvdc scheme could be operated in six-pulse mode for short periods of maintenance  the last mercury arc system was shut down in 2012 
the
valve was first used in hvdc systems in 1972  the thyristor is a solid-state
device similar to the   but with an extra control terminal that is used to switch the device on at a particular instant during the ac cycle  because the voltages in hvdc systems  up to 800kv in some cases  far exceed the
of the thyristors used  hvdc thyristor valves are built using large numbers of thyristors in series  additional passive components such as grading
and
need to be connected in parallel with each thyristor in order to ensure that the voltage across the valve is evenly shared between the thyristors  the thyristor plus its grading circuits and other auxiliary equipment is known as a thyristor level 
thyristor valve stacks for pole 2 of the
between the north and south islands of   the man at the bottom gives scale to the size of the valves 
each thyristor valve will typically contain tens or hundreds of thyristor levels  each operating at a different  high  potential with respect to earth  the command information to turn on the thyristors therefore cannot simply be sent using a wire connection  it needs to be isolated  the isolation method can be magnetic but is usually optical  two optical methods are used  indirect and direct optical triggering  in the indirect optical triggering method  low-voltage control electronics send light pulses along optical fibres to the high-side control electronics  which derives its power from the voltage across each thyristor  the alternative direct optical triggering method dispenses with most of the high-side electronics  instead using light pulses from the control electronics to switch
 ltts   although a small monitoring electronics unit may still be required for protection of the valve 
in a line-commutated converter  the dc current  usually  cannot change direction  it flows through a large inductance and can be considered almost constant  on the ac side  the converter behaves approximately as a current source  injecting both grid-frequency and harmonic currents into the ac network  for this reason  a line commutated converter for hvdc is also considered as a current-source inverter 
voltage-sourced converters  
because thyristors can only be turned on  not off  by control action  the control system has only one degree of freedom  when to turn on the thyristor  this is an important limitation in some circumstances 
with some other types of semiconductor device such as the
 igbt   both turn-on and turn-off can be controlled  giving a second degree of freedom  as a result  they can be used to make self-commutated converters  in such converters  the polarity of dc voltage is usually fixed and the dc voltage  being smoothed by a large capacitance  can be considered constant  for this reason  an hvdc converter using igbts is usually referred to as a voltage sourced converter  the additional controllability gives many advantages  notably the ability to switch the igbts on and off many times per cycle in order to improve the harmonic performance  being self-commutated  the converter no longer relies on synchronous machines in the ac system for its operation  a voltage sourced converter can therefore feed power to an ac network consisting only of passive loads  something which is impossible with lcc hvdc 
hvdc systems based on voltage sourced converters normally use the six-pulse connection because the converter produces much less harmonic distortion than a comparable lcc and the twelve-pulse connection is unnecessary 
most of the vsc hvdc systems built until 2012 were based on the two level converter  which can be thought of as a six pulse bridge in which the thyristors have been replaced by igbts with inverse-parallel diodes  and the dc smoothing reactors have been replaced by dc smoothing capacitors  such converters derive their name from the discrete  two voltage levels at the ac output of each phase that correspond to the electrical potentials of the positive and negative dc terminals 
 pwm  is usually used to improve the harmonic distortion of the converter 
some hvdc systems have been built with three level converters  but today most new vsc hvdc systems are being built with some form of multi-level converter  most commonly the modular multi-level converter  mmc   in which each valve consists of a number of independent converter submodules  each containing its own storage capacitor  the igbts in each submodule either bypass the capacitor or connect it into the circuit  allowing the valve to synthesize a stepped voltage with very low levels of harmonic distortion 
converter transformers  
a single-phase  three-winding converter transformer  the long valve-winding bushings  which project through the wall of the   are shown on the left  the line-winding bushing projects vertically upwards at centre-right
at the ac side of each converter  a bank of transformers  often three physically separated single-phase transformers  isolate the station from the ac supply  to provide a local earth  and to ensure the correct eventual dc voltage  the output of these transformers is then connected to the converter 
converter transformers for lcc hvdc schemes are quite specialised because of the high levels of harmonic currents which flow through them  and because the secondary winding insulation experiences a permanent dc voltage  which affects the design of the insulating structure  valve side requires more solid insulation  inside the tank  in lcc systems  the transformer s  also need to provide the 30 phase shift needed for harmonic cancellation 
converter transformers for vsc hvdc systems are usually simpler and more conventional in design than those for lcc hvdc systems 
reactive power  
a major drawback of hvdc systems using line-commutated converters is that the converters inherently consume   the ac current flowing into the converter from the ac system lags behind the ac voltage so that  irrespective of the direction of active power flow  the converter always absorbs reactive power  behaving in the same way as a shunt   the reactive power absorbed is at least 0.5mvar mw under ideal conditions and can be higher than this when the converter is operating at higher than usual firing or extinction angle  or reduced dc voltage 
although at
connected directly to
some of the reactive power may be provided by the generators themselves  in most cases the reactive power consumed by the converter must be provided by banks of shunt
connected at the ac terminals of the converter  the shunt capacitors are usually connected directly to the grid voltage but in some cases may be connected to a lower voltage via a tertiary winding on the converter transformer 
since the reactive power consumed depends on the active power being transmitted  the shunt capacitors usually need to be subdivided into a number of switchable banks  typically 4 per converter  in order to prevent a surplus of reactive power being generated at low transmitted power 
the shunt capacitors are almost always provided with tuning reactors and  where necessary  damping resistors so that they can perform a dual role as
filters 
voltage-source converters  on the other hand  can either produce or consume reactive power on demand  with the result that usually no separate shunt capacitors are needed  other than those required purely for filtering  
harmonics and filtering  
all
converters generate some degree of harmonic distortion on the ac and dc systems to which they are connected  and hvdc converters are no exception 
with the recently developed modular multi-level converter  mmc   levels of harmonic distortion may be practically negligible  but with line-commutated converters and simpler types of voltage-source converters  considerable harmonic distortion may be produced on both the ac and dc sides of the converter  as a result  harmonic filters are nearly always required at the ac terminals of such converters  and in hvdc transmission schemes using overhead lines  may also be required on the dc side 
filters for line-commutated converters  
the basic building-block of a line-commutated hvdc converter is the   this arrangement produces very high levels of harmonic distortion by acting as a current source injecting harmonic currents of order 6n1 into the ac system and generating harmonic voltages of order 6n superimposed on the dc voltage 
it is very costly to provide harmonic filters capable of suppressing such harmonics  so a variant known as the
 consisting of two six-pulse bridges in series with a 30 phase shift between them  is nearly always used  with the twelve-pulse arrangement  harmonics are still produced but only at orders 12n1 on the ac side and 12n on the dc side  the task of suppressing such harmonics is still challenging  but manageable 
line-commutated converters for hvdc are usually provided with combinations of harmonic filters designed to deal with the 11th and 13th harmonics on the ac side  and 12th harmonic on the dc side  sometimes  high-pass filters may be provided to deal with 23rd  25th  35th  37th    on the ac side and 24th  36th    on the dc side  sometimes  the ac filters may also need to provide damping at lower-order  non-characteristic harmonics such as 3rd or 5th harmonics 
the task of designing ac harmonic filters for hvdc converter stations is complex and computationally intensive  since in addition to ensuring that the converter does not produce an unacceptable level of voltage distortion on the ac system  it must be ensured that the harmonic filters do not resonate with some component elsewhere in the ac system  a detailed knowledge of the harmonic impedance of the ac system  at a wide range of frequencies  is needed in order to design the ac filters 
dc filters are required only for hvdc transmission systems involving overhead lines  voltage distortion is not a problem in its own right  since consumers do not connect directly to the dc terminals of the system  so the main design criterion for the dc filters is to ensure that the harmonic currents flowing in the dc lines do not induce interference in nearby open-wire   with the rise in digital mobile
systems  which are much less susceptible to interference  dc filters are becoming less important for hvdc systems 
filters for voltage-sourced converters  
some types of voltage-sourced converters may produce such low levels of harmonic distortion that no filters are required at all  however  converter types such as the two-level converter  used with
 pwm   still require some filtering  albeit less than on line-commutated converter systems 
with such converters  the harmonic spectrum is generally shifted to higher frequencies than with line-commutated converters  this usually allows the filter equipment to be smaller  the dominant harmonic frequencies are
of the pwm frequency and multiples thereof  in hvdc applications  the pwm frequency is typically around 12khz 
configurations  
monopole  
block diagram of a monopole system with earth return
in a common configuration  called monopole  one of the terminals of the rectifier is connected to earth ground  the other terminal  at a potential high above or below ground  is connected to a transmission line  the
terminal may be connected to the corresponding connection at the inverting station by means of a second conductor 
monopole and earth return  
if no metallic conductor is installed  current flows in the
and or
between two specially designed earth electrodes  this arrangement is a type of
system 
the electrodes are usually located some tens of kilometres from the stations and are connected to the stations via a medium-voltage   the design of the electrodes themselves depends on whether they are located on land  on the shore or at sea  for the monopolar configuration with earth return  the earth current flow is unidirectional  which means that the design of one of the electrodes  the   can be relatively simple  although the design of
electrode is quite complex 
for long-distance transmission  earth return can be considerably cheaper than alternatives using a dedicated neutral conductor  but it can lead to problems such as 
electrochemical corrosion of long buried metal objects such as
underwater earth-return electrodes in seawater may produce
or otherwise affect water chemistry 
an unbalanced current path may result in a net magnetic field  which can affect magnetic
for ships passing over an underwater cable 
monopole and metallic return  
these effects can be eliminated with installation of a metallic return conductor between the two ends of the monopolar transmission line  since one terminal of the converters is connected to earth  the return conductor need not be insulated for the full transmission voltage which makes it less costly than the high-voltage conductor  the decision of whether or not to use a metallic return conductor is based upon economic  technical and environmental factors 
modern monopolar systems for pure overhead lines carry typically 1.5gw  if underground or underwater cables are used  the typical value is 600mw 
most monopolar systems are designed for future bipolar expansion  transmission line towers may be designed to carry two conductors  even if only one is used initially for the monopole transmission system  the second conductor is either unused  used as
or connected in parallel with the other  as in case of   
symmetrical monopole  
an alternative is to use two high-voltage conductors  operating at  half of the dc voltage  with only a single converter at each end  in this arrangement  known as the symmetrical monopole  the converters are earthed only via a high impedance and there is no earth current  the symmetrical monopole arrangement is uncommon with line-commutated converters  the
interconnection being a rare example  but is very common with voltage sourced converters when cables are used 
bipolar  
block diagram of a bipolar system that also has an earth return
in bipolar transmission a pair of conductors is used  each at a high potential with respect to ground  in opposite polarity  since these conductors must be insulated for the full voltage  transmission line cost is higher than a monopole with a return conductor  however  there are a number of advantages to bipolar transmission which can make it an attractive option 
under normal load  negligible earth-current flows  as in the case of monopolar transmission with a metallic earth-return  this reduces earth return loss and environmental effects 
when a fault develops in a line  with earth return electrodes installed at each end of the line  approximately half the rated power can continue to flow using the earth as a return path  operating in monopolar mode 
since for a given total power rating each conductor of a bipolar line carries only half the current of monopolar lines  the cost of the second conductor is reduced compared to a monopolar line of the same rating 
in very adverse terrain  the second conductor may be carried on an independent set of transmission towers  so that some power may continue to be transmitted even if one line is damaged 
a bipolar system may also be installed with a metallic earth return conductor 
bipolar systems may carry as much as 4gw at voltages of 660kv with a single converter per pole  as on the ningdongshandong project in china  with a power rating of 2000mw per twelve-pulse converter  the converters for that project were  as of 2010  the most powerful hvdc converters ever built  even higher powers can be achieved by connecting two or more twelve-pulse converters in series in each pole  as is used in the 800kv
project in china  which uses two twelve-pulse converter bridges in each pole  each rated at 400kv dc and 1600mw 
submarine cable installations initially commissioned as a monopole may be upgraded with additional cables and operated as a bipole 
a block diagram of a bipolar hvdc transmission system  between two stations designated a and b  ac  represents an alternating current network con  represents a converter valve  either
or   tr represents a power   dctl is the direct-current transmission line conductor  dcl is a direct-current filter   bp represents a bypass switch  and pm represent
and harmonic filter networks required at both ends of the link  the dc transmission line may be very short in a back-to-back link  or extend hundreds of miles  km  overhead  underground or underwater  one conductor of the dc line may be replaced by connections to  
a bipolar scheme can be implemented so that the polarity of one or both poles can be changed  this allows the operation as two parallel monopoles  if one conductor fails  transmission can still continue at reduced capacity  losses may increase if ground electrodes and lines are not designed for the extra current in this mode  to reduce losses in this case  intermediate switching stations may be installed  at which line segments can be switched off or parallelized  this was done at  
back to back  
a back-to-back station  or b2b for short  is a plant in which both converters are in the same area  usually in the same building  the length of the direct current line is kept as short as possible  hvdc back-to-back stations are used for
coupling of electricity grids of different frequencies  as in
and   and the gcc interconnection between uae  50hz  and saudi arabia  60hz  completed in 2009 
coupling two networks of the same nominal frequency but no fixed phase relationship  as until 1995/96 in       and the   
coupling two networks of the same nominal frequency and a fixed phase shift relationship  an example in north america is hydro-quebec network  60hz  which has a 90 degree phase difference with the ieso  ontario   new york and new england networks  60hz  
different frequency and phase number  for example  as a replacement for  
the dc voltage in the intermediate circuit can be selected freely at hvdc back-to-back stations because of the short conductor length  the dc voltage is usually selected to be as low as possible  in order to build a small
and to reduce the number of thyristors connected in series in each valve  for this reason  at hvdc back-to-back stations  valves with the highest available current rating  in some cases  up to 4,500a  are used 
multi-terminal systems  
the most common configuration of an hvdc link consists of two converter stations connected by an
or undersea cable 
multi-terminal hvdc links  connecting more than two points  are rare  the configuration of multiple terminals can be series  parallel  or hybrid  a mixture of series and parallel   parallel configuration tends to be used for large capacity stations  and series for lower capacity stations  an example is the 2,000mw
system opened in 1992  which is currently the largest multi-terminal hvdc system in the world 
multi-terminal systems are difficult to realise using line commutated converters because reversals of power are effected by reversing the polarity of dc voltage  which affects all converters connected to the system  with voltage sourced converters  power reversal is achieved instead by reversing the direction of current  making parallel-connected multi-terminals systems much easier to control  for this reason  multi-terminal systems are expected to become much more common in the near future 
china is expanding its grid to keep up with increased power demand  while addressing environmental targets  china southern power grid started a three terminals vsc hvdc pilot project in 2011  the project has designed ratings of 160kv 200mw-100mw-50mw and will be used to bring wind power generated on nanao island into the mainland guangdong power grid through 32km of combination of hvdc land cables  sea cables and overhead lines  this project was put into operation on december 19  2013 
in india  the multiterminal
project is planned for commissioning in 2016  it will be rated 8000 mw  800 kv using four bipolar lines  and will transmit power from two converter stations in the east to a converter at   a distance of 1728km 
tripole  
a scheme patented in 2004 is intended for conversion of existing ac transmission lines to hvdc  two of the three circuit conductors are operated as a bipole  the third conductor is used as a parallel monopole  equipped with reversing valves  or parallel valves connected in reverse polarity   the parallel monopole periodically relieves current from one pole or the other  switching polarity over a span of several minutes  the bipole conductors would be loaded to either 1.37 or 0.37 of their thermal limit  with the parallel monopole always carrying 1 times its thermal limit current  the combined
heating effect is as if each of the conductors is always carrying 1.0 of its rated current  this allows heavier currents to be carried by the bipole conductors  and full use of the installed third conductor for energy transmission  high currents can be circulated through the line conductors even when load demand is low  for removal of ice 
as of 2012  no tri-pole conversions are in operation  although a transmission line in
has been converted to bipole hvdc     
other arrangements  
consists of 3 poles  from which 2 are switched in parallel and the third uses an opposite polarity with a higher transmission voltage  a similar arrangement was the
in
after a capacity upgrade in 1992  in which the two original converters  using mercury-arc valves  were parallel-switched feeding the same pole and a new third  thyristor  converter installed with opposite polarity and higher operation voltage  this configuration ended in 2012 when the two old converters were replaced with a single  new  thyristor converter 
corona discharge  
is the creation of
in a
 such as   by the presence of a strong  
are torn from neutral air  and either the positive ions or the electrons are attracted to the conductor  while the charged particles drift  this effect can cause considerable power loss  create audible and radio-frequency interference  generate toxic compounds such as oxides of nitrogen and ozone  and bring forth arcing 
both ac and dc transmission lines can generate coronas  in the former case in the form of oscillating particles  in the latter a constant wind  due to the
formed around the conductors  an hvdc system may have about half the loss per unit length of a high voltage ac system carrying the same amount of power  with monopolar transmission the choice of polarity of the energized conductor leads to a degree of control over the corona discharge  in particular  the polarity of the ions emitted can be controlled  which may have an environmental impact on ozone creation 
generate considerably more ozone than   and generate it further downwind of the power line  creating the potential for health effects  the use of a
voltage will reduce the ozone impacts of monopole hvdc power lines 
applications  
overview  
the controllability of a current-flow through hvdc rectifiers and inverters  their application in connecting unsynchronized networks  and their applications in efficient submarine cables mean that hvdc interconnections are often used at national or regional boundaries for the exchange of power  in north america  hvdc connections divide much of canada and the united states into several electrical regions that cross national borders  although the purpose of these connections is still to connect unsynchronized ac grids to each other   offshore windfarms also require undersea cables  and their
are unsynchronized  in very long-distance connections between two locations  such as power transmission from a large hydroelectric power plant at a remote site to an urban area  hvdc transmission systems may appropriately be used  several schemes of these kind have been built  for interconnections to     and the
north  the decreased line-costs of hvdc also make it applicable  see   other applications are noted throughout this article 
ac network interconnections  
ac transmission lines can interconnect only
with the same frequency with limits on the allowable phase difference between the two ends of the line  many areas that wish to share power have unsynchronized networks  the power grids of the   northern europe and continental europe are not united into a single synchronized network 
has 50hz and 60hz networks  continental north america  while operating at 60hz throughout  is divided into regions which are unsynchronised          and  
and   which share the enormous
hydroelectric plant  operate on 60hz and 50hz respectively  however  hvdc systems make it possible to interconnect unsynchronized ac networks  and also add the possibility of controlling ac voltage and reactive power flow 
a
connected to a long ac transmission line may become unstable and fall out of synchronization with a distant ac power system  an hvdc transmission link may make it economically feasible to use remote generation sites 
located off-shore may use hvdc systems to collect power from multiple unsynchronized generators for transmission to the shore by an underwater cable 
in general  however  an hvdc power line will interconnect two ac regions of the power-distribution grid  machinery to convert between ac and dc power adds a considerable cost in power transmission  the conversion from ac to dc is known as   and from dc to ac as   above a certain break-even distance  about 50km for submarine cables  and perhaps 600800km for overhead cables   the lower cost of the hvdc electrical conductors outweighs the cost of the electronics 
the conversion electronics also present an opportunity to effectively manage the power grid by means of controlling the magnitude and direction of power flow  an additional advantage of the existence of hvdc links  therefore  is potential increased stability in the transmission grid 
renewable electricity superhighways  
two hvdc lines cross near  
a number of studies have highlighted the potential benefits of very wide area
based on hvdc since they can mitigate the effects of intermittency by averaging and smoothing the outputs of large numbers of geographically dispersed wind farms or solar farms  czisch s study concludes that a grid covering the fringes of europe could bring 100  renewable power  70  wind  30  biomass  at close to today s prices  there has been debate over the technical feasibility of this proposal and the political risks involved in energy transmission across a large number of international borders 
the construction of such green power superhighways is advocated in a
that was released by the
and the
in 2009 
is developing four hvdc lines in the u s  for long distance electric power transmission 
in january 2009  the european commission proposed 300million to subsidize the development of hvdc links between ireland  britain  the netherlands  germany  denmark  and sweden  as part of a wider 1.2billion package supporting links to offshore wind farms and cross-border interconnectors throughout europe  meanwhile  the recently founded
has embraced a mediterranean solar plan to import large amounts of concentrating solar power into europe from north africa and the middle east
