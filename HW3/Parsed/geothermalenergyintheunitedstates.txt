one of 21 power plants at   california  the largest geothermal development in the world 
geothermal energy in the united states generated a record of about 16.792 million megawatt-hours in 2012  narrowly beating the previous record of 16.789 set in 1993  in 2012  the
led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,386
 mw  of installed capacity  the largest group of geothermal
in the world is located at   a geothermal field in   the united states generates an average of 15 billion kilowatt hours of geothermal power per year  comparable to burning some 25 million barrels  4,000,000m3  of oil or 6 million short tons of coal per year  in the twelve months through april 2013  geothermal energy generated 16.9 million megawatt-hours  0.41  of total us electricity 
geothermal power plants are largely concentrated in the western states  they are the fourth largest source of renewable electricity  after     and   a geothermal resource assessment shows that nine western states together have the potential to provide over 20 percent of national electricity needs

history  
according to archaeological evidence  geothermal resources have been in use on the current territory of the united states for more than 10,000 years  the paleo-indians first used geothermal hot springs for warmth  cleansing  and minerals 
the first commercial geothermal power plant producing power to the u s  utility grid opened at the geysers in california in 1960  producing eleven megawatts of net power  the geysers system continues to operate successfully today  and the complex has grown into the largest geothermal development in the world  with an output of 750 mw

the largest dry steam field in the world is   116km  72mi  north of   it was here that
began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power plant in the united states in 1960  the original turbine lasted for more than 30years and produced 11 net power  the geysers has 1517  mw  of active installed capacity with an average capacity factor of 63  
owns 15 of the 18 active plants in the geysers and is currently the united states  largest producer of geothermal energy  two other plants are owned jointly by the
and the city of  s municipal
 now called    the remaining bottle rock power plant owned by the
has only recently been reopened  a nineteenth plant is now under development by ram power  formerly western geopower  since the activities of one geothermal plant affects those nearby  the consolidation plant ownership at the geysers has been beneficial because the plants operate cooperatively instead of in their own short-term interest  the geysers is now recharged by injecting treated sewage effluent from the city of
and the
sewage treatment plant  this sewage effluent used to be dumped into rivers and streams and is now piped to the geothermal field where it replenishes the steam produced for power generation 
another major geothermal area is located in south central   on the southeast side of the   near the cities of
and   california  in 2001  there were 15 geothermal plants producing electricity in the area 
owns about half of them and the rest are owned by various companies  combined the plants have a capacity of about 570 mw    a 50 mw plant opened in may 2012  the first in the area in 20 years  a second similar plant is to open in 2013 
the
geologic province in   southeastern   southwestern  
and western
is now an area of rapid geothermal development  several small power plants were built during the late 1980s during times of high power prices  rising energy costs have spurred new development  plants in nevada at   brady desert peak    soda lake  stillwater and
now produce about 235 mw

production and development  
us electricity generated from geothermal sources 1960-2008  blue   and as a percentage of total us electricity  red  
with 3,040.27 mw of installed geothermal capacity  the united states remains the world leader with 30  of the online capacity total  the future outlook for expanded production from conventional and enhanced geothermal systems is positive as new technologies promise increased growth in locations previously not considered 
as of august 2008  103 new projects are under way in 13 u s  states  when developed  these projects could potentially supply up to 3,979 mw of power  meeting the needs of about 4 million homes  at this rate of development  geothermal production in the united states could exceed 15,000 mw by 2025 
the most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the   this act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit  previously available only to wind power projects and certain kinds of biomass  it also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the   and enabled the bureau of land management to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits

in 2009  investment bank
calculated that geothermal power costs 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour  versus 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal  if geothermal receives loans with lower rates than offered by the market  
reliability  
unlike some other renewable power sources such as wind and solar  geothermal energy is   meaning that it is both available whenever needed  and can quickly adjust output to match demand  according to the us energy information administration  eia   of all types of new electrical generation plants  geothermal generators have the highest   a measure of how much power a facility actually generates as a percent of its maximum capacity  the eia rates new geothermal plants as having a 92  capacity factor      higher than those of nuclear  90    gas  87    or coal  85    and much higher than those of intermittent sources such as onshore wind  34   or solar photovoltaic  25    while the carrier medium for geothermal electricity  water  must be properly managed  the source of geothermal energy  the earth s heat  will be available  for most intents and purposes  indefinitely   
in 2008 the
funded research in
 egs  to learn more about the fracture systems in
and better predict the results of   the doe geothermal technologies program  part of the   provided funding to establish the
 ngds   through the ngds  many older paper archives and drill logs that are stored at state
are now being digitized and made available for free to the public 
environmental effects  
the underground hot water and steam used to generate geothermal power may contain chemicals that could pollute the air and water if released at the surface 
  which is toxic in high concentrations  is sometimes found in geothermal systems  newer methods of generating geothermal power separate the hot steam collected underground from the steam used to power turbines  and substantially reduce the risk of releasing air-polluting contaminants 
the water mixed with the steam contains dissolved salts that can damage pipes and harm aquatic ecosystems  some subsurface water associated with geothermal sources contain high concentrations of toxic elements such as     and  
injection of water in enhanced geothermal systems may cause   earthquakes at the geysers geothermal field in california  the largest being richter magnitude 4.6  have been linked to injected water 
 possible effects include scenery spoliation  drying out of hot springs  soil erosion  noise pollution  and chemical pollution of the atmosphere and of surface- and groundwaters
