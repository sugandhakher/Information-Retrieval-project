social cognition is how people deal with
 members of the same species  or even across species  such as pet  information  include four stages  encoding  storage  retrieval  and processing  in the area of   social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of
and   according to this view  social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them  the major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception  judgment  and memory of social stimuli  the effects of social and affective factors on information processing  and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes  this level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology  including research on intrapersonal  interpersonal  intragroup  and intergroup processes 
however  the term social cognition has also been used in multiple areas in
and  in these areas  the term social cognition is most often used to refer to various social abilities disrupted in  
and other disorders  in
the biological basis of social cognition is investigated

historical development  
social cognition came to prominence with the rise of
in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream   common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as    such as     or   a focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed  social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes  theories  and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in
  
and   
  and   and
 schemas     it is likely that social psychology has always had a more
than general psychology approach  as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as
and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by  
a notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory  although this is not the basis of all social cognition studies  for example  see    it has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as
and
may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition  and that these different disciplines might be merged into a  coherent integrated whole   a parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action  termed   which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process 
social schemas  
social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from
in   which describes how ideas or    are
and how they are   according to this view  when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or schema is  activated  bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association  this activation often happens unconsciously  as a result of activating such schemas  judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available  since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information  this may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not  for example  if an individual is introduced as a teacher  then a  teacher schema  may be activated  subsequently  we might associate this person with wisdom or authority  or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important 
when a schema is more accessible this means that it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation  two cognitive processes that increase the accessibility of schemas are
and   salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation  the higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible  for example  if there is one female in a group of seven males  female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group s thinking and
toward the female group member  priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible  for example  watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas  increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats 
social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established   especially when that information contrasts with the existing schema  for example  a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy  after encountering a teacher who is timid and shy  a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his her existing teacher schema  pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information  as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent  this is referred to as a   sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case  leaving the original schema intact without any alterations  this is referred to as subtyping 
social cognition researchers are also interested in studying the
of activated schemas  it is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic  meaning that it is outside individual conscious control  in many situations however  the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the
of the situation in which case an individual is
to
the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and   whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control  high self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior  however  when people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts  a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible 
cultural differences  
social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition  although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world  the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing  for example  one study interviewed a scottish settler and a bantu herdsman from swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle  because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the bantu people  the bantu herdsmen s schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the scottish settler  the bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others  while the scottish settler was not 
studies have found that culture influences social cognition in other ways too  in fact  cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment  for example  a number of studies have found that people who grow up in east asian cultures such as
and
tend to develop holistic thinking styles  whereas people brought up in western cultures like australia and the usa tend to develop analytic thinking styles  the typically eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other  for example  if an easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he she might scan everyone s face in the class  and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling  on the other hand  the typically western analytic thinking style is a type of thinking style in which people focus on individual objects and neglect to consider the surrounding context  for example  if a westerner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling  then he or she might focus only on the classmate s face in order to make the judgment 
nisbett  2003  suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the east  i e 
and   versus the greek philosophical traditions  i e  of aristotle and plato  of the west  however  recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures  one study found that scenes from japanese cities were  busier  than those in the usa as they contain more objects which compete for attention  in this study  the eastern holistic thinking style  and focus on the overall context  was attributed to the busier nature of the japanese physical environment 
social cognitive neuroscience  
early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of   whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes  more recent
studies have shown that
disrupt social cognitive processes  for example  damage to the frontal lobes can affect emotional responses to social stimuli
and performance on
tasks  in the   damage to the
can lead to the  
people with
such as          
and
show differences in social behavior compared to their unaffected peers  parents with
 ptsd  show disturbances in at least one aspect of social cognition  namely 
with their young children only after a laboratory-induced relational stressor as compared to healthy parents without ptsd  however  whether social cognition is underpinned by domain-specific neural mechanisms is still an open issue  there is now an expanding research field examining how such conditions may bias cognitive processes involved in social interaction  or conversely  how such biases may lead to the symptoms associated with the condition 
the development of social cognitive processes in infants and children has also been researched extensively  see    for example  it has been suggested that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior  such as   may be   consistent with this  very young babies recognize and selectively respond to social stimuli such as the voice  face and scent of their mother
