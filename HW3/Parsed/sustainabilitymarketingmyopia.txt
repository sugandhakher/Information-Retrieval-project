myopia

background  
marketing myopia  
the marketing myopia theory was originally proposed in 1960 by american economist   according to levitt marketers should not overlook the importance of company potential and product attributes at the expenses of market needs  catering for market needs should receive first priority 
a company  besides being technically sound and product oriented  also needs to be customer oriented in order to successfully cater for a market  knowledge of customer needs and of innovations that can be implemented to maintain customer interest  as well as of how to adapt to the changing business market is crucial 
marketing myopia has been highly influential in the formation of modern marketing theory  and was heeded by marketers to such an extent that some authors now speak of a new marketing myopia stemming from too narrow a focus on customer to the exclusion of other stakeholders 
green marketing myopia  
green marketing is the marketing of products that are presumed to be environmentally safe  in order to be successful  green marketing must fulfill two objectives  improved environmental quality and customer satisfaction  misjudging either or overemphasizing the former at the expense of the latter can be defined as green marketing myopia 
the marketing discipline has long argued that innovation must consider an intimate understanding of the customer and a close look at green marketing practices over time reveals that green products must be positioned on a consumer value sought by targeted consumers 
as such  successful green products are able to appeal to mainstream consumers or lucrative market niches and frequently command price premiums by offering non-green consumer value  such as convenience and performance   when consumers are convinced of the desirable non-green benefits of environmental products  they are more inclined to adopt them 
aside from offering environmental benefits that do not meet consumer preferences  green marketing myopia can also occur when green products fail to provide credible  substantive environmental benefits 
towards sustainability  
sustainability marketing myopia  
sustainability marketing aims at marketing sustainable products and services which satisfy customer needs and significantly improve the social and environmental performance along the whole life cycle  while increasing customer value and achieving the company s objectives  in turns  sustainability marketing myopia is an exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological attributes of the product over the core consumer values  a distortion of the marketing process which is likely to lead to the product failing on the market or remaining confined in a small alternative niche 
just as an excessive focus on product attributes generates marketing myopia  and just as a single-minded focus on customers results in new marketing myopia  in both green and sustainability marketing an unbalanced strategy neglecting one aspect  namely  product attributes  is detrimental to the effectiveness of the marketing process 
however  it is important to note that sustainability marketing myopia differs from green marketing myopia in that the former follows a broader approach to the marketing myopia issue  taking into account the social attributes of a product  as well as the environmental ones  at the same time  sustainability marketing myopia encompasses sustainable services and product-related services  not products alone 
avoiding sustainability marketing myopia  
generally  sustainability marketing myopia can be avoided in two ways 
by identifying and stressing the inherent consumers values  efficiency and cost-effectiveness  health and safety  convenience  symbolism and status  of the socio-ecological features of the product  in other words  companies should highlight the personal customer benefits stemming from the socio-ecological features of the product 
by aligning socio-ecological attributes with core benefits of the product to create motive alliances  core benefits of the product can comprise functionality  performance  design  durability  taste  freshness  uniqueness  aesthetics  fashion  motive alliances are the connections of such core benefits with the relevant socio-ecological attributes embedded in the product  an operation also known as  
et al  provides examples of successful marketing communications based on the highlighting of inherent consumers values of the socio-ecological features of products  and on bundling 
value

efficiency and cost effectiveness

besides striking a right balance of focus between product attributes and consumers benefits  sustainability marketers should also avoid employing
about the socio-environmental benefits of their products  this particular form of marketing myopia is best avoided by building an image of credibility for the
through effective sustainability communication  so that consumers can easily associate their products with sound socio-environmental performances 
case studies  
myopia of sustainable services  
electrolux washing machines  
according to the authors of natural capitalism product dematerialisation is one of the prerequisites for a more sustainable business model  in order to become more sustainable the future economy will transform from sale of goods to the sale of services  belz and peattie also stress the role of services as a part of sustainable solution  talking of product-related  use-oriented and result-oriented services  product-related services are offered additionally and they optimize the product use  e g  automobile companies offering courses on a more ecological and safe driving manner  in the case of use-oriented services  a service and not a product is sold to the consumer e g  car-sharing  as for result-oriented services  consumers neither own nor operate a product e  g  public transportation  with consumers only enjoying the outcome of the product  the transportation services 
product dematerialisation is  too  at risk of incurring in sustainability marketing myopia  in 1999 electrolux piloted an use-oriented sustainable pay-per-wash service in sweden  failing to succeed because of a myopic marketing approach  new energy and water efficient washing machines were distributed by electrolux among consumers  electrolux supplied customers with maintenance services through a central database via the internet and took care of the disposal and upgrading of the machines  consumers did not pay for the machines themselves  they were only charged with a small installation fee at the beginning  and through a pay-per-wash charging system  10 swedish kronor  about 1    per wash   however  an excessive emphasis on the green component in the marketing of this service  achieved at the expenses of other consumer benefits and values  failed to convince the consumers  according to a  ottmann et al  not only environmental but also other inherent consumer values should have been better marketed by electrolux  convenience of pay-per-wash  including easy trade-ins for upgrades  free service and saved money of a new washing machine  in addition  the sustainable service might have been successful if pay-per-wash convenience would have been bundled with more desirable features 
myopia of sustainable products  
fairtrade coffee  
the initial idea of introducing the
coffee certification was to abolish poverty among coffee farmers and their workers by supporting better working conditions and enabling growers to compete in the global market  for this reason  fairtrade coffee started to be acquired directly from the farmers for a higher price than standard coffee  a minimum price for coffee is guaranteed and if the market prices outreach the minimum  growers receive a premium  in compliance with rising consumers demand for environmentally and social beneficial products the fairtrade certification appears to be an evident indicator  products marked with the label have to meet standards ensuring that strict social and environmental measures are taken 
the first generation of fairtrade coffee suffered from sustainability marketing myopia  first  due to the exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological aspects the quality and the taste of the coffee were put into the background  most coffee farmers used to sell their coffee to both fairtrade and open markets  as the price in the open market is entirely defined by quality  farmers sold their better quality beans in that market and then squandered their poorer beans into the fairtrade market  where they were nonetheless ensured a good price  furthermore  the certainty that fairtrade buyers would mix supplies together discouraged farmers to improve the quality of their own beans without having any financial reward for that 
furthermore  fairtrade coffee failed to guarantee the social and environmental benefits to the consumer as covenant  moreover  fairtrade has been accused of misleading consumers about its ability to monitor production practices  with particular regards to salary conditions of temporary workers 
the first generation fairtrade coffee with a worse quality and bitter taste failed to satisfy all customers needs and supposedly to improve the social performance along the whole life cycle of the product 
green buildings  
as well as electrolux and fairtrade coffee suppliers  the producers of green buildings in western europe suffered from sustainability marketing myopia in the experimental stages of energy-efficient houses  companies focussed on the energy-efficient attributes of the houses at the expenses of cost-effectiveness and affordability  marketing their products on the basis of   ecology and energy-savings  in addition  further inherent consumer values as comfort and design were also ignored at these early stages 
nevertheless  since the beginning of the twenty-first century marketers from construction companies have improved their strategies  successful sustainability marketing concepts have been progressively adopted  including motive alliances and the use of a new marketing mix based on so-called 4 cs  consumer solution  consumer cost  communication and convenience  this new approach has fostered a rise in the market share of energy-efficient houses 
81fnf holzbau is an example of such a company applying successful marketing strategies  it is a fast expanding german company which focuses on energy-efficient wooden houses  conventional criteria as high-quality levels and comfort are aligned with sustainable components in the company   healthy indoor environment created by using natural woods  energy savings and security from future oil price rises are among the arguments used  their interactive online toolkit  allows to easily calculate the life cycle cost and savings compared to conventional houses and acts  therefore  as a credibility tool  in order to offer the broadest choice in terms of consumer solutions  different house models are provided to various customer target groups according to their environmental consciousness and affordability
