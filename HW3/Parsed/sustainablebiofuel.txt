biofuel options  
biofuel development and use is a complex issue because there are many biofuel options which are available  biofuels  such as
and   are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch  sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include      
and   some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct
and animal feed  and claim that in some parts of the world the economic consequences are already visible  other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops 
are now being produced from a much broader range of feedstocks including the cellulose in dedicated energy crops  perennial grasses such as
and    forestry materials  the co-products from food production  and domestic vegetable waste  advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels  through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels  from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources 
in 2007 
suggested in
that production of biofuels could be either responsible or irresponsible and had several trade-offs   produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment  they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by western society  and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none  produced irresponsibly  they at best offer no climate benefit and  at worst  have detrimental social and environmental consequences  in other words  biofuels are pretty much like any other product  in 2008 the nobel prize-winning chemist
published findings that the release of
 n2o  emissions in the production of
means that they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace 
according to the   sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production  nor cause water or environmental problems  and would enhance soil fertility  the selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions  a key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland 
plants used as sustainable biofuel

s production of
from
dates back to the 1970s  as a governmental response to the   brazil is considered the biofuel industry leader and the world s first
economy  in 2010 the
designated brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an
due to epa s estimated 61  reduction of
  including   brazil sugarcane ethanol fuel program success and sustainability is based on the most efficient agricultural technology for sugarcane cultivation in the world  uses modern equipment and cheap
as feedstock  the residual cane-waste    is used to process heat and power  which results in a very competitive price and also in a high
 output energy input energy   which varies from 8.3 for average conditions to 10.2 for best practice production 
a report commissioned by the united nations  based on a detailed review of published research up to mid-2009 as well as the input of independent experts world-wide  found that ethanol from sugar cane as produced in brazil  in some circumstances does better than just zero emission  if grown and processed correctly  it has negative emission  pulling co2 out of the atmosphere  rather than adding it  in contrast  the report found that u s  use of
for biofuel is less efficient  as sugarcane can lead to emissions reductions of between 70  and well over 100  when substituted for gasoline  several other studies have shown that sugarcane-based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 86 to 90  if there is no significant land use change 
in another study commissioned by the
government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production  this evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric  corn  coffee and soybean cropping  the study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control and is one of the primary objectives of brazils cane genetic improvement programs  disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane 
another concern is the fact that sugarcane fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers  by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals  and also to fertilize the fields with ash  mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people  and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined  by the 2008 harvest season  around 47  of the cane was collected with harvesting machines 
regarding the negative impacts of the potential
on carbon emissions  the study commissioned by the dutch government concluded that  it is very difficult to determine the indirect effects of further land use for sugar cane production  i e  sugar cane replacing another crop like soy or citrus crops  which in turn causes additional soy plantations replacing pastures  which in turn may cause deforestation   and also not logical to attribute all these soil carbon losses to sugar cane   the brazilian agency
estimates that there is enough agricultural land available to increase at least 30 times the existing sugarcane plantation without endangering sensible ecosystems or taking land destined for food crops  most future growth is expected to take place on abandoned
lands  as it has been the historical trend in so paulo state  also  productivity is expected to improve even further based on current biotechnology research  genetic improvement  and better agronomic practices  thus contributing to reduce land demand for future sugarcane cultures 
location of environmentally valuable areas with respect to sugarcane plantations    located in the   concentrates two-thirds of sugarcane cultures 
another concern is the risk of clearing rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production  such as the   the
or the   embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7  of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the amazonia  and expansion during the last 25 years took place in the center-south region  also far away from the amazonia  the pantanal or the atlantic forest  in so paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands  the impact assessment commissioned by the dutch government supported this argument 
in order to guarantee a sustainable development of ethanol production  in september 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas  according to the new criteria  92.5  of the brazilian territory is not suitable for sugarcane plantation  the government considers that the suitable areas are more than enough to meet the future demand for ethanol and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades 
regarding the
issue  a
research report published on july 2008 found that  brazil s sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher   this research paper also concluded that brazil s sugar canebased ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly  an economic assessment report also published in july 2008 by the
agrees with the world bank report regarding the negative effects of subsidies and trade restrictions  but found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller  a study by the brazilian research unit of the
regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices concluded that the major driver behind the
was speculative activity on
under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks  the study also concluded that there is no correlation between brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices  as on the contrary  the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country 
jatropha  
india and africa  
in  
crops like   used for biodiesel  can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won t grow  or would produce only slow growth yields  jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities 
cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare  in parts of rural india and africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha  moreover  villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees  their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too 
cambodia  
cambodia has no proven fossil fuel reserves  and is almost completely dependent on imported
for electricity production  consequently  cambodians face an insecure supply and pay some of the highest energy prices in the world  the impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development 
biofuels may provide a substitute for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price  independent of the international oil price  the local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security  rural development opportunities and environmental benefits  the
species appears to be a particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in cambodia  local sustainable production of biofuel in cambodia  based on the jatropha or other sources  offers good potential benefits for the investors  the economy  rural communities and the environment 
mexico  
jatropha is native to mexico and central america and was likely transported to india and africa in the 1500s by portuguese sailors convinced it had medicinal uses  in 2008  recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions  mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don t threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares  6.4 million acres  of land with a high potential to produce jatropha  the yucatn peninsula  for instance  in addition to being a corn producing region  also contains abandoned
plantations  where the growing of jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food 
on april 1  2011
completed the first mexican aviation biofuels test flight on an   the fuel was a 70 30 traditional jet fuel biojet blend produced from jatropha oil provided by three mexican producers  global energas renovables  a wholly owned subsidiary of u s -based   bencafser s a  and energy jh s a  honeywell s uop processed the oil into bio-spk  synthetic paraffinic kerosene    global energas renovables operates the largest jatropha farm in the americas 
on august 1  2011     and the mexican government participated in the first biojet powered transcontinental flight in aviation history  the flight from mexico city to madrid used a blend of 70 percent traditional fuel and 30 percent biofuel     the biojet was produced entirely from  
pongamia pinnata in australia and india  
seeds in  
is a legume native to australia  india  florida  usa  and most tropical regions  and is now being invested in as an alternative to jatropha for areas such as northern australia  where jatropha is classed as a noxious weed  commonly known as simply  pongamia   this tree is currently being commercialised in australia by   for use as a diesel replacement for running in modified diesel engines or for conversion to biodiesel using 1st or 2nd generation biodiesel techniques  for running in unmodified diesel engines 
sweet sorghum in india  
overcomes many of the shortcomings of other biofuel crops  with sweet sorghum  only the stalks are used for biofuel production  while the grain is saved for food or livestock feed  it is not in high demand in the global food market  and thus has little impact on food prices and food security  sweet sorghum is grown on already-farmed drylands that are low in carbon storage capacity  so concerns about the clearing of rainforest do not apply  sweet sorghum is easier and cheaper to grow than other biofuel crops in india and does not require irrigation  an important consideration in dry areas  some of the indian sweet sorghum varieties are now grown in uganda for ethanol production 
a study by researchers at the
   found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by us 40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food  feed and fuel  with grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares  ha  in asia and on 23.4 million ha in africa  a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact 
international collaboration on sustainable biofuels  
roundtable on sustainable biomaterials  
public attitudes and the actions of key stakeholders can play a crucial role in realising the potential of sustainable biofuels  informed discussion and dialogue  based both on scientific research and an understanding of public and stakeholder views  is important 
the roundtable on sustainable biofuels is an international initiative which brings together farmers  companies  governments  non-governmental organizations  and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution  during 2008  the roundtable used meetings  teleconferences  and online discussions to develop a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production 
in 2008  the roundtable for sustainable biofuels released its proposed standards for sustainable biofuels  this includes 12 principles 
 biofuel production shall follow international treaties and national laws regarding such things as air quality  water resources  agricultural practices  labor conditions  and more 
biofuels projects shall be designed and operated in participatory processes that involve all relevant stakeholders in planning and monitoring 
biofuels shall significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions as compared to fossil fuels  the principle seeks to establish a standard methodology for comparing greenhouse gases  ghg  benefits 
biofuel production shall not violate human rights or labor rights  and shall ensure decent work and the well-being of workers 
biofuel production shall contribute to the social and economic development of local  rural and indigenous peoples and communities 
biofuel production shall not impair food security 
biofuel production shall avoid negative impacts on biodiversity  ecosystems and areas of high conservation value 
biofuel production shall promote practices that improve soil health and minimize degradation 
surface and groundwater use will be optimized and contamination or depletion of water resources minimized 
air pollution shall be minimized along the supply chain 
biofuels shall be produced in the most cost-effective way  with a commitment to improve production efficiency and social and environmental performance in all stages of the biofuel value chain 
biofuel production shall not violate land rights  
in april 2011  the roundtable on sustainable biofuels launched a set of comprehensive sustainability criteria - the rsb certification system  biofuels producers that meet to these criteria are able to show buyers and regulators that their product has been obtained without harming the environment or violating human rights 
sustainable biofuels consensus  
the sustainable biofuels consensus is an international initiative which calls upon governments  the private sector  and other stakeholders to take decisive action to ensure the sustainable trade  production  and use of biofuels  in this way biofuels may play a key role in energy sector transformation  climate stabilization  and resulting worldwide revitalisation of rural areas 
the sustainable biofuels consensus envisions a  landscape that provides food  fodder  fiber  and energy  which offers opportunities for rural development  that diversifies energy supply  restores ecosystems  protects biodiversity  and sequesters carbon

in 2008  a multi-stakeholder process was initiated by the
and the   the private development arm of the   bringing together industry  supply chain intermediaries  end-users  farmers and civil society organisations to develop standards for certifying the derivative products of   one of which is  
the
standard is based around a definition of sustainability which is founded on five principles 
obey the law
respect human rights and labour standards
manage input  production and processing efficiencies to enhance sustainability
actively manage biodiversity and ecosystem services
continuously improve key areas of the business
biofuel producers that wish to sell products marked with the bonsucro standard must both ensure that they product to the production standard  and that their downstream buyers meet the chain of custody standard  in addition  if they wish to sell to the european market and count against the   then they must adhere to the bonsucro eu standard  which includes specific greenhouse gas calculations following
calculation guidelines 
sustainability standards  
see also 
several countries and regions have introduced policies or adopted standards to promote sustainable biofuels production and use  most prominently the
and the   the 2009   which requires 10 percent of transportation energy from
by 2020  is the most comprehensive mandatory sustainability standard in place as of 2010  the directive requires that the lifecycle
of biofuels consumed be at least 50 percent less than the equivalent emissions from gasoline or diesel by 2017  and 35 percent less starting in 2011   also  the feedstocks for biofuels  should not be harvested from lands with high biodiversity value  from carbon-rich or forested land  or from wetlands  
as with the eu  the
 rfs  and the
 lcfs  both require specific levels of lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions compared to equivalent fossil fuel consumption  the rfs requires that at least half of the biofuels production mandated by 2022 should reduce lifecycle emissions by 50 percent  the lcfs is a performance standard that calls for a minimum of 10 percent emissions reduction per unit of transport energy by 2020  both the u s  and california standards currently address only greenhouse gas emissions  but california plans to  expand its policy to address other sustainability issues associated with liquid biofuels in the future  
in 2009 
also adopted new sustainability policies for   including  zoning regulation of sugarcane expansion and social protocols  
oil price moderation  
biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and
moderation  according to the   crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive  if it were not for biofuels  a healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes 
sustainable transport  
see also 
biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a silver bullet to deal with transport emissions  biofuels on their own cannot deliver a
system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach  which promotes other
options and   as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport  consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles  public transport  and better town and rural planning 
in december 2008 an
jet completed the world s first commercial aviation test flight partially using jatropha-based fuel  more than a dozen performance tests were undertaken in the two-hour test flight which departed from auckland international airport  a biofuel blend of 50 50 jatropha and jet a1 fuel was used to power one of the boeing 747-400 s rolls-royce rb211 engines  air new zealand set several criteria for its jatropha  requiring that  the land it came from was neither forest nor virgin grassland in the previous 20 years  that the soil and climate it came from is not suitable for the majority of food crops and that the farms are rain fed and not mechanically irrigated   the company has also set general sustainability criteria  saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources  that they must be as good as traditional   and that they should be cost competitive 
in january 2009 
used a sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft for the first time in north america  this demonstration flight marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft  a   powered by cfm international cfm56-7b engines  the biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants  the algae oil was provided by   and the jatropha oil by  
in march 2011 
research showed significant potential for
based on jatropha-curcas  according to the research  if cultivated properly   jatropha can deliver many benefits in latin america and greenhouse gas reductions of up to 60 percent when compared to petroleum-based jet fuel   actual farming conditions in latin america were assessed using sustainability criteria developed by the roundtable on sustainable biofuels  unlike previous research  which used theoretical inputs  the yale team conducted many interviews with jatropha farmers and used  field measurements to develop the first comprehensive sustainability analysis of actual projects  
as of june 2011  revised international aviation fuel standards officially allow commercial airlines to blend conventional jet fuel with up to 50 percent biofuels  the renewable fuels  can be blended with conventional commercial and military jet fuel through requirements in the newly issued edition of astm d7566  specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons  
in december 2011  the faa awarded  7.7 million to eight companies to advance the development of commercial aviation biofuels  with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel  the faa is assisting in the development of a sustainable fuel  from alcohols  sugars  biomass  and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils  that can be dropped in to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure  the research will test how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards 
greensky london  a biofuels plant under construction in 2014  will take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal rubbish and change the organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel  and 40 megawatts of power  by the end of 2015  all british airways flights from london city airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by london residents
