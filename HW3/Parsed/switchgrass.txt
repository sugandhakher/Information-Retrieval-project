description  
root system of switchgrass grown at the
switchgrass is a hardy  deep-rooted 
grass that begins growth in late   it can grow up to 2.7m high  but is typically shorter than
grass or   the
are 3090cm long  with a prominent midrib  switchgrass uses   giving it an advantage in conditions of
and high temperature  its
have a well-developed   often up to 60cm long  and it bears a good crop of   the seeds are 36mm long and up to 1.5mm wide  and are developed from a single-flowered   both
are present and well developed  when ripe  the seeds sometimes take on a pink or dull-purple tinge  and turn golden brown with the foliage of the plant in the fall  switchgrass is both a perennial and self-seeding crop  which means farmers do not have to plant and reseed after annual harvesting  once established  a switchgrass stand can survive for ten years or longer  unlike corn  switchgrass can grow on marginal lands and requires relatively modest levels of   overall  it is considered a resource-efficient  low-input crop for producing bioenergy from farmland 
habitat  
much of north america  especially the prairies of the midwestern united states  was once prime habitat to vast swaths of native grasses  including switchgrass 
 sorghastrum nutans   eastern gamagrass     big bluestem     little bluestem     bluestem prairie    and others  as
began spreading west across the continent  the native grasses were plowed under and the land converted to crops such as     and   introduced grasses such as     and
also replaced the native grasses for use as hay and pasture for cattle 
distribution  
switchgrass is a versatile and adaptable plant  it can grow and even thrive in many weather conditions  lengths of growing seasons  soil types  and land conditions  its distribution spans south of latitude 55n from
to   south over most of the
east of the   and further south into   as a warm-season
grass  most of its growth occurs from late spring through early fall  it becomes dormant and unproductive during colder months  thus  the productive season in its northern habitat can be as short as three months  but in the southern reaches of its habitat the growing season may be as long as eight months  around the
area 
switchgrass is a diverse species  with striking differences between plants  this diversity  which presumably reflects evolution and adaptation to new environments as the species spread across the continent  provides a range of valuable traits for breeding programs  switchgrass has two distinct forms  or  cytotypes   the lowland   which tend to produce more biomass  and the upland cultivars  which are generally of more northern origin  more cold-tolerant  and therefore usually preferred in northern areas  upland switchgrass types are generally shorter   2.4m  tall  and less coarse than lowland types  lowland cultivars may grow to  2.7m  in favorable environments  both upland and lowland cultivars are deeply rooted    1.8m  in favorable soils  and have short   the upland types tend to have more vigorous rhizomes  so the lowland cultivars may appear to have a
habit  while the upland types tend to be more sod-forming  lowland cultivars appear more plastic in their morphology  produce larger plants if stands become thin or when planted in wide rows  and they seem to be more sensitive to moisture stress than upland cultivars 
in native prairies  switchgrass is historically found in association with several other important native
plants  such as big bluestem  indiangrass  little bluestem    eastern gamagrass  and various
       and prairie coneflower   these widely adapted tallgrass species once occupied millions of hectares

establishment and management  
switchgrass can be grown on land considered unsuitable for
production  including land that is too
for
production  as well as
and
soils in
regions that typically produce low
of other
crops  no single method of establishing switchgrass can be suggested for all situations  the crop can be established both by
and conventional   when seeded as part of a diverse mixture  planting guidelines for warm-season grass mixtures for conservation plantings should be followed  regional guidelines for growing and managing switchgrass for bioenergy or conservation plantings are available  several key factors can increase the likelihood of success for establishing switchgrass  these include 
planting switchgrass after the soil is well warmed during the spring 
using seeds that are highly
and planting 0.6 - 1.2cm deep  or up to 2cm deep in sandy soils 
packing or firming the soil both before and after seeding 
providing no
at planting to minimize competition 
controlling
with chemical and or cultural control methods 
and properly labeled
are recommended for   chemical weed control can be used in the
prior to establishment  or before or after planting  weeds should be mowed just above the height of the growing switchgrass 
herbicides  such as   should be avoided as they are known to reduce development of switchgrass when applied early in the establishing year  plantings that appear to have failed due to weed infestations are often wrongly assessed  as the failure is often more apparent than real  switchgrass stands that are initially weedy commonly become well established with appropriate management in subsequent years  once established  switchgrass can take up to three years to reach its full production potential  depending on the region  it can typically produce 1/4 to 1/3 of its yield potential in its first year and 2/3 of its potential in the year after seeding 
after establishment  switchgrass management will depend on the goal of the seeding  historically  most switchgrass seedings have been managed for the
in the us  disturbance such as periodic mowing  burning  or disking is required to optimize the stands utility for encouraging   increased attention is being placed on switchgrass management as an   generally  the crop requires modest application of   as it is not a heavy feeder  typical nitrogen  n  content of
material in the fall is 0.5  n  fertilizer nitrogen applications of about 5kg n  applied for each
of
removed is a general guideline  more specific recommendations for fertilization are available regionally in   herbicides are not often used on switchgrass after the seeding year  as the crop is generally quite competitive with weeds  most bioenergy conversion processes for switchgrass  including those for cellulosic ethanol and pellet fuel production  can generally accept some alternative
in the
  stands of switchgrass should be harvested no more than twice per year  and one cutting often provides as much biomass as two  switchgrass can be harvested with the same
used for
production  and it is well-suited to
or bulk field harvesting  if its
is properly taken into consideration  switchgrass can offer great potential as an energy crop 
uses  
switchgrass can be used as a
for
energy production  as
for   and to control   for
and   as game cover  and as feedstock for biodegradable plastics  it can be used by cattle farmers for
and
and as a substitute for wheat
in many applications  including
bedding  straw bale housing  and as a substrate for growing mushrooms

additionally  switchgrass is grown as a drought-resistant
in average to wet soils and in full sun to part shade 
bioenergy  
switchgrass has been researched as a renewable
crop since the mid-1980s  because it is a native
warm season
with the ability to produce moderate to high
on marginal farmlands  it is now being considered for use in several bioenergy conversion processes  including
production    and direct combustion for
applications  the main
advantages of switchgrass as a bioenergy crop are its stand longevity  drought and flooding tolerance  relatively low
and
input requirements  ease of management  hardiness in poor soil and climate conditions  and widespread adaptability in
climates  in some warm humid southern zones  such as   it has the ability to produce up to 25 oven-dry tonnes per hectare  odt ha   a summary of switchgrass yields across 13 research trial sites in the
found the top two cultivars in each trial to yield 9.4 to 22.9 t ha  with an average yield of 14.6 odt ha  however  these yields were recorded on small plot trials  and commercial field sites could be expected to be at least 20  lower than these results  in the united states  switchgrass yields appear to be highest in warm humid regions with long growing seasons such as the us southeast and lowest in the dry short season areas of the northern   the energy inputs required to grow switchgrass are favorable when compared with
such as     or   which can require relatively high energy inputs for field operations  crop drying  and fertilization  whole plant
perennial
grass feedstocks are desirable biomass energy feedstocks  as they require fewer fossil energy inputs to grow and effectively capture solar energy because of their c4
system and perennial nature  one study cites it takes from 0.97 to 1.34 gj to produce 1 tonne of switchgrass  compared with 1.99 to 2.66 gj to produce 1 tonne of corn  another study found that switchgrass uses 0.8 gj odt of fossil energy compared to grain corn s 2.9 gj odt  given that switchgrass contains approximately 18.8 gj odt of biomass  the energy output-to-input ratio for the crop can be up to 20 1  this highly favorable ratio is attributable to its relatively high energy output per hectare and low energy inputs for production 
considerable effort is being expended in developing switchgrass as a
crop in the usa  in   he proposed using switchgrass for ethanol  since then  over 100 million has been invested into researching switchgrass as a potential biofuel source  switchgrass has the potential to produce up to 380liters of
per tonne harvested  however  current technology for herbaceous biomass conversion to ethanol is about 340liters per tonne  in contrast  corn ethanol yields about 400liters per tonne 
there are substantial efforts being made to increase the yield of corn derived ethanol 
 corn-  ethanol yield has already improved from 2.4 gallons per bushel in the 1980s to 2.8 gallons in modern plants  corn hybrids developed specifically for ethanol production have demonstrated ethanol yield increases of 2.7 percentand using the cellulose  fiber  in the corn kernel  in addition to the starch  could increase yield by another 10 to 13 percent  with this combination of hybrid and process optimization  theoretical yields of 3.51 gallons of ethanol per bushel are within reasonwith no negative impact on protein or oil content for animal feed uses of the distillers grains 
process improvements for the conventional corn-based industry are based on new technologies such as   new
and new  
the main advantage of using switchgrass over corn as an ethanol feedstock is its cost of production is generally about 1/2 that of grain corn  and more biomass energy per hectare can be captured in the field  thus  switchgrass cellulosic ethanol should give a higher
of ethanol per hectare at lower cost  however  this will depend on whether the cost of constructing and operating cellulosic ethanol plants can be reduced considerably  the switchgrass ethanol industry
is also considered to be substantially better than that of   during the
process  the
fraction of switchgrass can be burned to provide sufficient
and
to operate the   studies have found that for every unit of energy input needed to create a biofuel from switchgrass  four
are yielded  in contrast  corn ethanol yields about 1.28 units of energy per unit of energy input  a recent study from the great plains
indicated that for ethanol production from switchgrass  this figure is 6.4  or alternatively  that 540  more energy was contained in the ethanol produced than was used in growing the switchgrass and converting it to   however  there remain
barriers to the development of cellulosic ethanol technology  projections in the early 1990s for commercialization of cellulosic ethanol by the year 2000 have not been met  the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol is thus proving to be a significant challenge  despite noteworthy research efforts 
thermal energy applications for switchgrass appear to be closer to near-term scale-up than cellulosic ethanol for industrial or small-scale applications  for example  switchgrass can be
that are subsequently burned in
used to heat homes  which typically burn corn or    switchgrass has been widely tested as a substitute for
in   the most widely studied project to date has been the chariton valley project in   the show-me-energy cooperative  smec  in
is using switchgrass and other warm-season grasses  along with
residues  as feedstocks for pellets used for the firing of a coal-fired power plant  in   switchgrass is being used on a pilot scale as a feedstock for commercial heating applications 
studies have been undertaken and it appears to be well-suited as a commercial boiler fuel  research is also being undertaken to develop switchgrass as a pellet fuel because of lack of surplus wood residues in eastern canada  as a slowdown in the forest products industry in 2009 is now resulting in
shortages throughout eastern north america  generally speaking  the direct firing of switchgrass for thermal applications can provide the highest
and energy output-to-input ratio of all switchgrass bioconversion processes  research has found switchgrass  when pelletized and used as a solid biofuel  is a good candidate for displacing fossil fuels  switchgrass pellets were identified to have a 14.6 1 energy output-to-input ratio  which is substantially better than that for liquid biofuel options from farmland  as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy  switchgrass pellets were found to be an effective means to use farmland to mitigate greenhouse gases on the order of 7.6-13 tonnes per hectare of co2  in contrast  switchgrass cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol were found to mitigate 5.2 and 1.5 tonnes of co2 per hectare  respectively 
historically  the major constraint to the development of grasses for thermal energy applications has been the difficulty associated with burning grasses in conventional   as biomass quality problems can be of particular concern in combustion applications  these technical problems now appear to have been largely resolved through crop management practices such as fall
and spring
that allow for
to occur  which leads to fewer -forming compounds  such as k and cl  and n in the grass  this reduces
formation and   and enables switchgrass to be a clean combustion fuel source for use in smaller combustion appliances  fall harvested grasses likely have more application for larger commercial and industrial boilers  switchgrass is also being used to heat small
and farm buildings in
and
through a process used to make a low quality
substitute 
bai et al   2010  conducted a study to analyze the environmental sustainability of using switchgrass plant material as a feedstock for
production 
was used to make this assessment  they compared efficiency of     and ethanol with   they took into account air and water emissions associated with growing  managing  processing and storing the switchgrass crop  they also factored in the transportation of the stored switchgrass to the ethanol plant where they assumed the distance was 20km  the reductions in
potential by using e10 and e85 were 5 and 65   respectively  their models also suggested that the human toxicity potential and eco-toxicity potential were substantially greater for the high ethanol fuels  i e   e85 and ethanol  than for gasoline and e10 
in 2014  a genetically altered form of the bacterium caldicellulosiruptor bescii was created which can cheaply and efficiently turn switchgrass into ethanol 
biodegradable plastics production  
in a novel application  us scientists have genetically modified switchgrass to enable it to produce   which accumulates in beadlike granules within the plant s cells  in preliminary tests  the dry weight of a plants leaves were shown to comprise up to 3.7  of the polymer  such low accumulation rates do not  as of 2009  allow for commercial use of switchgrass as a biosource 
soil conservation  
further information      and
switchgrass is useful for
and   particularly in the united states and canada  where switchgrass is endemic  switchgrass has a deep fibrous root system  nearly as deep as the plant is tall  since it  along with other native grasses and   once covered the plains of the united states that are now the   the effects of the past switchgrass habitat have been beneficial  lending to the fertile farmland that exists today  the deep fibrous root systems of switchgrass left a deep rich layer of
in the soils of the midwest  making those
soils some of the most productive in the world  by returning switchgrass and other perennial prairie grasses as an agricultural crop  many marginal soils may benefit from increased levels of organic material  permeability  and fertility  due to the grass s deep root system 
soil   both from wind and water  is of great concern in regions where switchgrass grows  due to its height  switchgrass can form an effective wind erosion barrier  its root system  also  is excellent for holding soil in place  which helps prevent erosion from flooding and runoff  some
 for example    have used switchgrass in their seed mixes when re-establishing growth along roadways  it can also be used on
sites  dikes  and pond dams 
in many parts of the united states use it to control erosion in grass waterways because of its ability to anchor soils while providing habitat for wildlife 
forages and grazing  
switchgrass is an excellent
for cattle  however  it has shown toxicity in horses  sheep  and goats through chemical compounds known as   which cause
and liver damage in these animals  researchers are continuing to learn more about the specific conditions under which switchgrass causes harm to these species  but until more is discovered  it is recommended switchgrass not be fed to them  for cattle  however  it can be fed as hay  or grazed 
grazing switchgrass calls for watchful management practices to ensure survival of the stand  it is recommended that grazing begin when the plants are about 50cm tall  and that grazing be discontinued when the plants have been eaten down to about 25cm  and to rest the pasture 30  45 days between grazing periods  switchgrass becomes stemmy and unpalatable as it matures  but during the target grazing period  it is a favorable forage with a
 rfv  of 90-104  the grass s upright growth pattern places its growing point off the soil surface onto its stem  so leaving 25cm of stubble is important for regrowth  when harvesting switchgrass for hay  the first cutting occurs at the late boot stage  around mid-june  this should allow for a second cutting in mid-august  leaving enough regrowth to survive the winter 
game cover  
switchgrass is well-known among wildlife conservationists as good forage and habitat for upland
species  such as       and   and   with its plentiful small seeds and tall cover  a study published in 2015 has shown that switchgrass  when grown in a traditional monoculture  has an adverse impact on some wildlife  depending on how thickly switchgrass is planted  and what it is partnered with  it also offers excellent forage and cover for other wildlife across the country  for those producers who have switchgrass stands on their farm  it is considered an environmental and aesthetic benefit due to the abundance of wildlife attracted by the switchgrass stands  some members of prairie lands bio-products  inc  in iowa have even turned this benefit into a profitable business by leasing their switchgrass land for hunting during the proper seasons  the benefits to wildlife can be extended even in large-scale agriculture through the process of strip harvesting  as recommended by   which suggests that rather than harvesting an entire field at once  strip harvesting could be practiced so that the entire habitat is not removed  thereby protecting the wildlife inhabiting the switchgrass
