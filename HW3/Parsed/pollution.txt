has always accompanied civilizations  pollution started from prehistoric times when man created the first fires  according to a 1983 article in the journal science    found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires   metal
appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home  core samples of glaciers in greenland indicate increases in pollution associated with greek  roman and chinese metal production  but at that time the pollution was comparatively small and could be handled by nature 
urban pollution
air pollution in the us  1973
the burning of coal and wood  and the presence of many horses in concentrated areas made the cities the cesspools of pollution  the industrial revolution brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and
into local streams that served as the water supply 
of england banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in
in 1272  after its smoke became a problem  but the fuel was so common in england that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow 
it was the
that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today  london also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the
on the
of 1858  which led to construction of the
soon afterward  pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded view ability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem  reformers began to demand sewer systems  and clean water 
in 1870  the sanitary conditions in berlin were among the worst in europe 
recalled conditions before a modern
system was built in the late 1870s 
 waste-water from the houses collected in the gutters running alongside the curbs and emitted a truly fearsome smell  there were no public toilets in the streets or squares  visitors  especially women  often became desperate when nature called  in the public buildings the sanitary facilities were unbelievably primitive    as a metropolis  berlin did not emerge from a state of barbarism into civilization until after 1870  
the primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital  and the imperial german government brought in its scientists  engineers and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies but to forge berlin as the world s model city  a british expert in 1906 concluded that berlin represented  the most complete application of science  order and method of public life   adding  it is a marvel of civic administration  the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is  
the emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal gave rise to unprecedented
and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste  chicago and cincinnati were the first two american cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881  pollution became a major issue in the united states in the early twentieth century  as
took issue with air pollution caused by coal burning  water pollution caused by bad sanitation  and street pollution caused by the 3 million horses who worked in american cities in 1900  generating large quantities of urine and manure  as historian martin melosi notes  the generation that first saw automobiles replacing the horses saw cars as  miracles of cleanliness    by the 1940s  however  automobile-caused smog was a major issue in los angeles 
other cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century  when the short lived office of air pollution was created under the department of the interior  extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of
and
in the late 1940s  serving as another public reminder  air pollution would continue to be a problem in england  especially later during the industrial revolution  and extending into the recent past with the  
awareness of atmospheric pollution spread widely after world war ii  with fears triggered by reports of radioactive fallout from atomic warfare and testing  then a non-nuclear event  the
of 1952 in london  killed at least 4000 people  this prompted some of the first major modern environmental legislation  the  
pollution began to draw major public attention in the united states between the mid-1950s and early 1970s  when congress passed the   the   the

contamination at
starting in 1947 became a national news story in 1978 and led to the
legislation of 1980  the pollution of industrial land gave rise to the name   a term now common in  
the development of nuclear science introduced   which can remain lethally radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years    named by the
as the  most polluted spot  on earth  served as a disposal site for the soviet union throughout the 1950s and 1960s  second place may go to the area of chelyabinsk russian as the  most polluted place on the planet

pose a lingering specter of public mistrust  worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters  widespread support for

international catastrophes such as the wreck of the
oil tanker off the coast of
in 1978 and the
in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage  the borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming  most recently the term
 pop  has come to describe a group of chemicals such as
and
among others  though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data  they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the arctic  demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use 
a much more recently discovered problem is the   a huge concentration of plastics 
and other
which has been collected into a large area of the pacific ocean by the   this is a less well known pollution problem than the others described above  but nonetheless has multiple and serious consequences such as increasing wildlife mortality  the spread of invasive species and human ingestion of toxic chemicals  organizations such as
have researched the pollution and  along with artists like   are working toward publicizing the issue 
pollution introduced by light at night is becoming a global problem  more severe in urban centres  but nonetheless contaminating also large territories  far away from towns 
growing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to

cost of pollution
pollution has cost  manufacturing activities that cause
impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society  whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses  if external costs exist  such as pollution  the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs  because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self  an element of
is involved  if there are external benefits  such as in   less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others 
sources and causes
air pollution produced by ships may alter clouds  affecting global temperatures 
air pollution comes from both natural and human-made  anthropogenic  sources  however  globally human-made pollutants from combustion  construction  mining  agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation 
are one of the leading causes of air pollution       
  and
are the world leaders in air pollution emissions  principal stationary pollution sources include   coal-fired    
plants 
disposal activity  incinerators  large livestock farms  dairy cows  pigs  poultry  etc   
factories  metals production factories  plastics factories  and other   agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides

perspectives
the earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence  the attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of   these would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately  species extinction  processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations  at the extremes  for any form of life  consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival 
for humankind  the factor of technology is a distinguishing and critical consideration  both as an enabler and an additional source of byproducts  short of survival  human concerns include the range from quality of life to health hazards  since science holds experimental demonstration to be definitive  modern treatment of toxicity or environmental harm involves defining a level at which an effect is observable  common examples of fields where practical measurement is crucial include   industrial exposure  e g

and
doses  
 the solution to pollution is dilution   is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful  it is well-suited to some other modern  locally scoped applications such as laboratory safety procedure and
release emergency management  but it assumes that the dilutant is in virtually unlimited supply for the application or that resulting dilutions are acceptable in all cases 
such simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative  human population and densities were lower  technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign  but these are often no longer the case  furthermore  advances have enabled measurement of concentrations not possible before  the use of statistical methods in evaluating outcomes has given currency to the principle of probable harm in cases where assessment is warranted but resorting to deterministic models is impractical or infeasible  in addition  consideration of the environment beyond direct impact on human beings has gained prominence 
yet in the absence of a superseding principle  this older approach predominates practices throughout the world  it is the basis by which to gauge concentrations of effluent for legal release  exceeding which penalties are assessed or restrictions applied  one such superseding principle is contained in modern hazardous waste laws in developed countries  as the process of diluting hazardous waste to make it non-hazardous is usually a regulated treatment process  migration from pollution dilution to elimination in many cases can be confronted by challenging economical and technological barriers
