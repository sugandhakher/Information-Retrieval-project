simplified electrical grid with energy storage 
simplified grid energy flow with and without idealized energy storage for the course of one day 
grid energy storage  also called large-scale energy storage  is a collection of methods used to
on a large scale within an   electrical energy is stored during times when production  especially from intermittent power plants such as
sources such as       exceeds consumption  and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption 
as of 2016 by far the largest form of grid energy storage on grids is dammed hydroelectricity  with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage

benefits of storage and managing peak load  
the stores are used - feeding power to the grids - at times when consumption that cannot be deferred or delayed exceeds production  in this way  electricity production need not be drastically scaled up and down to meet momentary consumption instead  transmission from the combination of generators plus storage facilities is maintained at a more constant level 
an alternate and complementary approach to achieve the same effect as grid energy storage is to use a
communication infrastructure to enable
 dr   both of these technologies shift energy usage and transmission of power on the grid from one time  when it s not useful  to another  when it s desperately immediately needed  
any
must adapt energy production to energy consumption  both of which vary drastically over time  any combination of energy storage and demand response has these advantages 
fuel-based power plants  i e  coal  oil  gas  nuclear  can be more efficiently and easily operated at constant production levels
electricity generated by  or with the potential to be generated by  intermittent sources can be stored and used later  whereas it would otherwise have to be transmitted for sale elsewhere  or simply wasted
peak generating or transmission capacity can be reduced by the total potential of all storage plus deferrable loads  see    saving the expense of this capacity
more stable pricing  the cost of the storage and or demand management is included in pricing so there is less variation in power rates charged to customers  or alternatively  if rates are kept stable by law  less loss to the utility from expensive on-peak wholesale power rates when peak demand must be met by imported wholesale power
emergency preparednessvital needs can be met reliably even with no transmission or generation going on while non-essential needs are deferred
energy derived from photovoltaic  tidal and wind sources inherently varies  the amount of electrical energy produced varies with time of day  moon phase  season  and random factors such as the weather  thus  renewables present special challenges to electric utilities  while hooking up many separate wind sources can reduce the overall variability  solar is reliably not available at night  except when stored in   and tidal power shifts with the moon  so it is never reliably available on peak demand 
how much this affects any given utility varies significantly  in a
utility  more solar can generally be absorbed and matched to demand  in
utilities  to a lesser degree  wind correlates to heating demand and can be used to meet that demand  depending on these factors  beyond about 20-40  of total generation  grid-connected
such as
and
tend to require investment in either grid energy storage or demand side management or both 
in an
without energy storage  energy sources that rely on energy stored within fuels  coal  oil  gas  nuclear  must be scaled up and down to match the rise and fall of energy production from intermittent energy sources  see    while oil and gas plants can be scaled up when wind dies down quickly  coal and nuclear plants take considerable time to respond to load  utilities with less gas or oil power generation are thus more reliant on demand management and grid storage 
the french consulting firm yole dveloppement figures this stationary storage market could be a  13.5 billion opportunity by 2023  compared with less than  1 billion in 2015 
demand side management and grid storage  
as of 2014  most demand side management is small scale and in pilot phase  a few large scale projects in europe link industrial food freezer load - which can safely vary in temperature by only a few degrees - to wind power  in north america  water heaters  deferred drying and dishwashing and electric vehicle charging represent major opportunities for demand management 
whether or not to consider more-deeply-frozen food or more-heated water or a still-dirty dish or wet clothing a form of energy storage is debatable  electric vehicles can act as a mobile dispatch battery - portable grid storage -
but this gives rise to concerns about its charging lifespan  a more conventional approach is to use unreliable vehicle batteries in large scale grid storage
as they are expected to be good in this role for ten years   if such storage is done on a large scale it becomes much easier to guarantee replacement of a vehicle battery damaged by mobile dispatch  as the damaged battery has value and immediate use 
a report released in december 2013 by the
further describes the potential benefits of energy storage and demand side technologies to the electric grid  modernizing the electric system will help the nation meet the challenge of handling projected energy needsincluding addressing climate change by integrating more energy from renewable sources and enhancing efficiency from non-renewable energy processes  advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system  and energy storage can play a significant role in meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid  lowering cost and ensuring high reliability  as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments  finally  energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services 
the report was written by a core group of developers representing           and   all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage 
as of march 2012 
 psh  was the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available  the
 epri  reported that psh accounted for more than 99  of bulk storage capacity worldwide  around 127,000   psh
varies in practice between 70  to 75

forms  
air  
compressed air

another grid energy storage method is to use off-peak or renewably generated electricity to   which is usually stored in an old
or some other kind of geological feature  when electricity demand is high  the compressed air is heated with a small amount of
and then goes through
to generate electricity 
compressed air storage is typically around 60 - 90  efficient
liquid air

another electricity storage method is to compress and cool air  turning it into liquid air  which can be stored  and expanded when needed  turning a turbine  generating electricity  with a storage efficiency of up to 70  
batteries  
main articles      and
a 900 watt direct current light plant using 16 separate lead acid battery cells  32 volts  
battery storage was already used in the early days of
electric power  where ac grid power was not readily available  isolated lighting plants run by wind turbines or internal combustion engines provided lighting and power to small motors  the battery system could be used to run the load without starting the engine or when the wind was calm  a bank of lead-acid batteries in glass jars both supplied power to illuminate lamps  as well as to start an engine to recharge the batteries 
battery systems connected to large solid-state converters have been used to stabilize power distribution networks  for example  in puerto rico a system with a capacity of 20 megawatts for 15 minutes  5 megawatt hour  is used to stabilize the frequency of electric power produced on the island  a 27 megawatt 15-minute  6.75 megawatt hour  nickel-cadmium battery bank was installed at fairbanks alaska in 2003 to stabilize voltage at the end of a long transmission line  many  off-the-grid  domestic systems rely on battery storage  see   
another possible technology for large-scale storage is the use of specialist large-scale batteries such as
and
and  
could also be inexpensive to implement on a large scale and have been used for grid storage in japan and in the united states  magnesium-antimony batteries are also being developed for use in large scale storage  based on theories developed by
of mit 
and other types of flow batteries are also beginning to be used for energy storage including the averaging of generation from wind turbines  battery storage has relatively high efficiency  as high as 90  or better 
rechargeable

 australia  
at
 japan   as well as in other non-wind farm applications  a further 12 mwh flow battery is to be installed at the
    these storage systems are designed to smooth out transient fluctuations in wind energy supply  the redox flow battery mentioned in the first article cited above has a capacity of 6 mwh  which represents under an hour of electrical flow from this particular wind farm  at 20  capacity factor on its 30 mw rated capacity  
hydrogen bromide has been proposed for use in a utility-scale flow-type battery 
another available way to store electric energy in batteries is to use   they can be used for different purposes  available power per unit changes between 100kwh up to 40 mwh and 20 mw  2015   units could be connected in parallel  so there is no upper limit for capacity  see   
some grid batteries are co-located with renewable energy plants  either to smooth the power supplied by the intermittent wind or solar output  or to shift the power output into other hours of the day when the renewable plant cannot produce power directly  see   
the largest grid storage batteries in the united states include the 31.5mw battery at grand ridge power plant in illinois and the 31.5 mw battery at beech ridge  west virginia  two batteries under construction in 2015 include the 400mwh  100mw for 4 hours  southern california edison project and the 52 mwh project on kauai  hawaii to entirely time shift a 13mw solar farm s output to the evening  two batteries are in
 40 mw for 7 minutes using
cells   and in
 36 mw for 40 minutes using    a 13 mwh battery made of worn batteries from electric cars is being constructed in germany  with an expected second life of 10 years  after which they will be recycled 
in 2015  221 mw battery storage was installed in the usa  and total capacity is expected to be 1.7 gw in 2020  most was installed by utilities

electric vehicles  
main article 
  the world s top-selling highway-capable
as of 2015
companies are researching the possible use of electric vehicles to meet peak demand  a parked and plugged-in electric vehicle could sell the electricity from the battery during peak loads and charge either during night  at home  or during off-peak 
or
could be used
for their energy storage capabilities 
technology can be employed  turning each vehicle with its 20 to 50kwh
into a distributed load-balancing device or emergency power source  this represents 2 to 5 days per vehicle of average household requirements of 10kwh per day  assuming annual consumption of 3650kwh  this quantity of energy is equivalent to between 40 and 300 miles  64 and 483km  of range in such vehicles consuming 0.5 to 0.16kwh per mile  these figures can be achieved even in home-made   some electric utilities plan to use old plug-in vehicle batteries  sometimes resulting in a giant battery  to store electricity however  a large disadvantage of using vehicle to grid energy storage is the fact that each storage cycle stresses the battery with one complete charge-discharge cycle  conventional  cobalt-based  lithium ion batteries break down with the number of cycles - newer li-ion batteries do not break down significantly with each cycle  and so have much longer lives 
flywheel  
main articles 
and
nasa g2 flywheel
mechanical inertia is the basis of this storage method  when the electric power flows into the device  an
accelerates a heavy rotating disc  the motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed  slowing down the disc and producing electricity  electricity is stored as the
of the disc 
must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time  this is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using   tending to make the method expensive  greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as
or
to resist the   the ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic  however  tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application  they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving
in
systems such as the 20mw system in ireland 
applications that use flywheel storage are those that require very high bursts of power for very short durations such as
and
experiments where a motor generator is spun up to operating speed and is partially slowed down during discharge 
flywheel storage is also currently used in the form of the
to provide
systems  such as those in large   for ride-through power necessary during transfer that is  the relatively brief amount of time between a loss of power to the mains and the warm-up of an alternate source  such as a  
this potential solution has been implemented by eda   in the
on the islands of
and   this system uses an 18 megawatt-second flywheel to improve
and thus allow increased renewable energy usage  as the description suggests  these systems are again designed to smooth out transient fluctuations in supply  and could never be used to cope with an outage exceeding a couple of days 
powercorp in australia have been developing applications using wind turbines  flywheels and low load diesel  lld  technology to maximise the wind input to small grids  a system installed in coral bay  western australia  uses wind turbines coupled with a flywheel based control system and llds to achieve better than 60  wind contribution to the town grid   
hydrogen  
main articles 
and
is being developed as an electrical energy storage medium  hydrogen is produced  then compressed or liquefied  stored  and then converted back to electrical energy or heat  hydrogen can be used as a fuel for portable  vehicles  or stationary energy generation  compared to pumped water storage and batteries  hydrogen has the advantage that it is a high energy density fuel 
hydrogen can be produced either by
or by the
into hydrogen and
 see    reforming natural gas produces
as a by-product 
and
are two techniques by which the efficiency of hydrogen production may be able to be increased  hydrogen is then converted back to electricity in an   or a  
the ac-to-ac efficiency of hydrogen storage has been shown to be on the order of 20 to 45   which imposes economic constraints  the price ratio between purchase and sale of electricity must be at least proportional to the efficiency in order for the system to be economic  hydrogen fuel cells can respond quickly enough to correct rapid fluctuations in electricity demand or supply and regulate frequency  whether hydrogen can use natural gas infrastructure depends on the network construction materials  standards in joints  and storage pressure 
the equipment necessary for hydrogen energy storage includes an electrolysis plant 
or   and storage tanks 
is a process being investigated for producing hydrogen using biomass 
 microchp  can use hydrogen as a fuel 
some nuclear power plants may be able to benefit from a symbiosis with hydrogen production  high temperature  950 to 1,000c  gas cooled nuclear
have the potential to electrolyze hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat as in the   the first commercial reactors are expected in 2030 
a community based pilot program using
and hydrogen generators was started in 2007 in the remote community of   a similar project has been going on since 2004 in   a small norwegian island municipality 
underground hydrogen storage  
is the practice of
in underground  
and depleted oil and gas fields  large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by
 ici  for many years without any difficulties  the european project
indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it can t be covered by
and
systems 
power to gas  
is a technology which converts
power to a gas   there are 2 methods  the first is to use the electricity for
and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid  the second less efficient method is used to convert
and water to    see   using
and the   the excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid  using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen  fuel cell maker
and natural gas distributor
have teamed up to develop such a
system in canada 
pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen  before switching to   the german gas networks were operated using   which for the most part consisted of hydrogen  the storage capacity of the german natural gas network is more than 200,000 gwh which is enough for several months of energy requirement  by comparison  the capacity of all german pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 gwh  the transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss   0.1   than in a power network  8      the use of the existing
for hydrogen was studied by naturalhy
the power-to-ammonia concept  
the power-to-ammonia concept offers a carbon-free energy storage route with a diversified application palette  at times when there is a surplus of renewable electricity  it can be converted to ammonia locally using small-scale plants  existing technology can be used to produce ammonia by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen with the help of electricity  then using high temperature and pressure to convert the hydrogen plus nitrogen from the air into ammonia 
just like natural gas  the produced and stored ammonia can be used by energy companies at any time as fuel for electricity generation  ammonia can be stored as a liquid  a standard tank of 60,000 m3 contains about 211 gwh of energy  equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines on land  ammonia can be burned cleanly  water and nitrogen are released  but no co2 and little or no nitrogen oxides  ammonia can be further used as a flexible chemical as a fertilizer  chemical commodity  de-nox agent and energy carrier  given this flexibility of usage  and given the fact that the supporting infrastructure for the transport  distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place  it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a large-scale  non-carbon  energy carrier of the future 
hydroelectricity  
pumped water  
main article 
dam in  
in 2008 world pumped storage generating capacity was 104   while other sources claim 127 gw  which comprises the vast majority of all types of grid electric storage - all other types combined are some hundreds of mw 
in many places  pumped storage hydroelectricity is used to even out the daily generating load  by pumping water to a high storage reservoir during off-peak hours and weekends  using the excess base-load capacity from coal or nuclear sources  during peak hours  this water can be used for
generation  often as a high value rapid-response reserve to cover transient peaks in demand  pumped storage recovers about 70  to 85  of the energy consumed  and is currently the most cost effective form of mass power storage  the chief problem with pumped storage is that it usually requires two nearby reservoirs at considerably different heights  and often requires considerable capital expenditure 
pumped water systems have high   meaning they can come on-line very quickly  typically within 15 seconds  which makes these systems very efficient at soaking up variability in electrical demand from consumers  there is over 90 gw of pumped storage in operation around the world  which is about 3  of instantaneous global generation capacity  pumped water storage systems  such as the
storage system in britain  hold five or six hours of generating capacity  and are used to smooth out demand variations 
another example is the
in china  which has a reservoir capacity of eight million cubic meters  2.1 billion u s  gallons or the volume of water over
in 25 minutes  with a vertical distance of 600 m  1970feet   the reservoir can provide about 13 gwh of stored gravitational potential energy  convertible to electricity at about 80  efficiency   or about 2  of china s daily electricity consumption 
a new concept in pumped-storage is utilizing
or
to pump water 
or solar cells that direct drive
for an energy storing wind or solar
can make this a more efficient process but are limited  such systems can only increase kinetic water volume during windy and daylight periods 
hydroelectric dams  
in    
hydroelectric dams with large reservoirs can also be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand  water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released through the plant when demand is higher  the net effect is the same as pumped storage  but without the pumping loss  depending on the reservoir capacity the plant can provide daily  weekly  or seasonal load following 
many existing hydroelectric dams are fairly old  for example  the
was built in the 1930s   and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades  a hydroelectric dam originally built to provide
will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir  uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity  thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit  the
reports an investment cost of  69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam  compared to more than  400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators  while an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units  it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel  incoming river water  during periods of high output from other generating units  functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way  the uprated dam is one of the most efficient forms of energy storage  because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir  only increased losses to evaporation and leakage  a dam which impounds a large reservoir can store and release a correspondingly large amount of energy  by raising and lowering its reservoir level a few meters 
superconducting magnetic energy  
main article 
superconducting magnetic energy storage  smes  systems store energy in the
created by the flow of
in a
coil which has been
cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature  a typical smes system includes three parts  superconducting coil  power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator  once the superconducting coil is charged  the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely  the stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil  the power conditioning system uses an   to transform
 ac  power to direct current or convert dc back to ac power  the inverter rectifier accounts for about 23  energy loss in each direction  smes loses the least amount of
in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy  smes systems are highly efficient  the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95   the high cost of superconductors is the primary limitation for commercial use of this energy storage method 
due to the energy requirements of   and the limits in the total energy able to be stored  smes is currently used for short duration energy storage  therefore  smes is most commonly devoted to improving   if smes were to be used for
it would be a
storage device  charged from
power at night and meeting
during the day 
are yet to be solved for it to become practical 
thermal  
main article 
in denmark the direct storage of electricity is perceived as too expensive for very large scale usage  albeit significant usage is made of existing norwegian hydro  instead  the use of existing hot water storage tanks connected to district heating schemes  heated by either electrode boilers or heat pumps  is seen as a preferable approach  the stored heat is then transmitted to dwellings using
pipes 
is used to store heat collected by a
so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night  thermal efficiencies over one year of 99  have been predicted 
off-peak electricity can be used to make
from water  and the ice can be stored  the stored ice can be used to cool the air in a large building which would have normally used electric ac  thereby shifting the electric load to off-peak hours  on other systems stored ice is used to cool the intake air of a
  thus increasing the on-peak generation capacity and the on-peak efficiency 
a
system uses a highly reversible heat engine heat pump to pump heat between two storage vessels  heating one and cooling the other  the uk-based engineering company isentropic that is developing the system claims a potential electricity-in to electricity-out round-trip efficiency of 72-80  
  
according to   ski lifts and trains tracks are among places being considered to store energy by moving heavy objects up or down  
economics  
the levelized cost of storing electricity depends highly on storage type and purpose  as subsecond-scale   minute hour-scale peaker plants  or day week-scale season storage 
using battery storage is said to be u 0.12-0.17 per kwh 
generally speaking  energy storage is economical when the
of electricity varies more than the costs of storing and retrieving the energy plus the price of energy lost in the process  for instance  assume a
can pump to its upper reservoir a volume of water capable of producing 1,200
after all losses are factored in  evaporation and seeping in the reservoir  efficiency losses  etc    if the marginal cost of electricity during off-peak times is  15 per mwh  and the reservoir operates at 75  efficiency  i e   1,600 mwh are consumed and 1,200 mwh of energy are retrieved   then the total cost of filling the reservoir is  24,000  if all of the stored energy is sold the following day during peak hours for an average  40 per mwh  then the reservoir will see revenues of  48,000 for the day  for a
of  24,000 
however  the marginal cost of electricity varies because of the varying operational and fuel costs of different classes of generators  at one extreme 
such as -fired power plants and
plants are low marginal cost generators  as they have high capital and maintenance costs but low fuel costs  at the other extreme 
such as
plants burn expensive fuel but are cheaper to build  operate and maintain  to minimize the total operational cost of generating power  base load generators are dispatched most of the time  while peak power generators are dispatched only when necessary  generally when energy demand peaks  this is called  economic dispatch  
demand for
from the world s various grids varies over the course of the day and from season to season  for the most part  variation in electric demand is met by varying the amount of electrical energy supplied from primary sources  increasingly  however  operators are storing lower-cost energy produced at night  then releasing it to the grid during the peak periods of the day when it is more valuable  in areas where hydroelectric dams exist  release can be delayed until demand is greater  this form of storage is common and can make use of existing reservoirs  this is not storing  surplus  energy produced elsewhere  but the net effect is the same - although without the efficiency losses  renewable supplies with variable production  like
and   tend to increase the net variation in electric load  increasing the opportunity for grid energy storage 
it may be more economical to find an alternative market for unused electricity  rather than try and store it 
allows for transmission of electricity  losing only 3  per 1000km 
the united states department of energy s international energy storage database provides a free list of grid energy storage projects  many of which show funding sources and amounts 
load leveling  
the demand for electricity from consumers and industry is constantly changing  broadly within the following categories 
seasonal  during dark winters more electric lighting and heating is required  while in other climates hot weather boosts the requirement for air conditioning 
weekly  most industry closes at the weekend  lowering demand 
daily  such as the morning peak as offices open and
get switched on 
hourly  one method for estimating television viewing figures in the united kingdom is to measure the power spikes during advertisement breaks or after programmes when viewers go to switch a kettle on  
transient  fluctuations due to individual s actions  differences in power transmission efficiency and other small factors that need to be accounted for 
there are currently three main methods for dealing with changing demand 
electrical devices generally having a working
range that they require  commonly 110120v or 220240v  minor variations in load are automatically smoothed by slight variations in the voltage available across the system 
power plants can be run below their normal output  with the facility to increase the amount they generate almost instantaneously  this is termed  spinning reserve  
additional generation can be brought online  typically  these would be hydroelectric or gas turbines  which can be started in a matter of minutes 
the problem with standby gas turbines is higher costs  expensive generating equipment is unused much of the time  spinning reserve also comes at a cost  plants run below maximum output are usually less efficient  grid energy storage is used to shift generation from times of peak load to off-peak hours  power plants are able to run at their peak efficiency during nights and weekends 
supply-demand leveling strategies may be intended to reduce the cost of supplying peak power or to compensate for the intermittent generation of wind and solar power 
energy demand management  
main article 
in order to keep the supply of electricity consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand  if this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management  dsm   for decades  utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates  to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours  in the same way that telephone companies do with individual customers  usually  these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time  in an attempt to save more money  some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute   which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen  and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money  demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers  in residential and small business applications  for example  appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of  
units  refrigerators  and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw  energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours  a particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more
equipment  for example  many utilities give rebates for the purchase of     and appliances and
that are energy efficient  some utilities subsidize the purchase of
by their customers  to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70  more efficient  as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or resistive heating  companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products  but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment  like   or use more efficient processes to produce products  companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment  facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide  
portability  
this is the area of greatest success for current energy storage technologies  single-use and rechargeable batteries are ubiquitous  and provide power for devices with demands as varied as digital watches and cars  advances in battery technology have generally been slow  however  with much of the advance in battery life that consumers see being attributable to efficient power management rather than increased storage capacity  portable
have benefited greatly from size and power reductions associated with   unfortunately  moore s law does not apply to hauling people and freight  the underlying energy requirements for transportation remain much higher than for information and entertainment applications  battery capacity has become an issue as pressure grows for alternatives to
in cars  trucks  buses  trains  ships  and aeroplanes  these uses require far more
 the amount of energy stored in a given volume or weight  than current battery technology can deliver  liquid
fuel  such as   and    as well as alcohols      and   and
     have much higher energy densities 
there are synthetic pathways for using electricity to reduce carbon dioxide and water to liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels  these pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen  and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse   non-fossil sources of carbon dioxide include
plants and
plants  converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other engine-driven equipment  without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic   these synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve
in nations that rely on imported petroleum  but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity  as well as to deal with possible future
available to import 
because the transport sector uses the energy from petroleum very inefficiently  replacing petroleum with electricity for mobile energy will not require very large investments over many years   
reliability  
virtually all devices that operate on electricity are adversely affected by the sudden removal of their power supply  solutions such as ups    or backup generators are available  but these are expensive  efficient methods of power storage would allow for devices to have a built-in backup for power cuts  and also reduce the impact of a failure in a generating station  examples of this are currently available using
and flywheels
