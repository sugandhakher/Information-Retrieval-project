a 1956 world oil production distribution  showing historical data and future production  proposed by
 it has a peak of 12.5 billion barrels per year in about the year 2000
hubbert s upper-bound prediction for us crude oil production  1956   and actual lower-48 states production through 2014
peak oil  an event based on  s   is the point in time when the maximum rate of
is reached  after which it is expected to enter terminal decline  peak oil theory is based on the observed rise  peak  fall  and depletion of
production rate in
over time  it is often confused with   however  peak oil is the point of maximum production  while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply 
some observers  such as petroleum industry experts
and   predict negative
implications following a post-peak production decline and subsequent
increase because of the high dependence of most modern industrial     and
systems on the low cost and high availability of oil  predictions vary greatly as to what exactly these negative effects would be 
oil production forecasts on which predictions of peak oil are based are often made within a range which includes optimistic  higher production  and pessimistic  lower production  scenarios  optimistic estimations of peak production forecast the global decline will begin after 2020  and assume major investments in
will occur before a crisis  without requiring major changes in the lifestyle of heavily oil-consuming nations  pessimistic predictions of future oil production made after 2007 stated either that the peak had already occurred  that oil production was on the cusp of the peak  or that it would occur shortly 
hubbert s original prediction that us peak oil would be in about 1970 seemed accurate for a time  as us average annual production peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day  however  the successful application of massive
to additional tight reservoirs caused us production to rebound  challenging the inevitability of post-peak decline for the us oil production  in addition  hubbert s original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature

modeling global oil production  
main article 
the idea that the rate of oil production would peak and irreversibly decline is an old one  in 1919  david white  chief geologist of the   wrote of us petroleum      the peak of production will soon be passed  possibly within 3 years   in 1953  eugene ayers  a researcher for   projected that if us ultimate recoverable oil reserves were 100 billion barrels  then production in the us would peak no later than 1960  if ultimate recoverable were to be as high as 200 billion barrels  which he warned was wishful thinking  us peak production would come no later than 1970  likewise for the world  he projected a peak somewhere between 1985  one trillion barrels ultimate recoverable  and 2000  two trillion barrels recoverable   ayers made his projections without a mathematical model  he wrote   but if the curve is made to look reasonable  it is quite possible to adapt mathematical expressions to it and to determine  in this way  the peak dates corresponding to various ultimate recoverable reserve numbers 
by observing past discoveries and production levels  and predicting future discovery trends  the geoscientist m  king hubbert used statistical modelling in 1956 to accurately predict that united states oil production would peak between 1965 and 1971  hubbert used a semi- curved model  sometimes incorrectly compared to a    he assumed the production rate of a limited resource would follow a roughly symmetrical distribution  depending on the limits of exploitability and market pressures  the rise or decline of resource production over time might be sharper or more stable  appear more linear or curved  that model and its variants are now called   they have been used to describe and predict the peak and decline of production from regions  countries  and multinational areas  the same theory has also been applied to other limited-resource production 
in a 2006 analysis of hubbert theory  it was noted that uncertainty in real world oil production amounts and confusion in definitions increases the uncertainty in general of production predictions  by comparing the fit of various other models  it was found that hubbert s methods yielded the closest fit over all  but that none of the models were very accurate  in 1956 hubbert himself recommended using  a family of possible production curves  when predicting a production peak and decline curve 
more recently  the term  peak oil  was popularized by
and kjell aleklett in 2002 when they helped form the association for the study of peak oil and gas  aspo   in his publications  hubbert used the term  peak production rate  and  peak in the rate of discoveries  
demand  
global consumption of oil 19802013  energy information administration 
the
side of peak oil over time is concerned with the total quantity of oil that the global market would choose to consume at various possible market prices and how this entire listing of quantities at various prices would evolve over time  global demand for crude oil grew an average of 1.76  per year from 1994 to 2006  with a high growth of 3.4  in 20032004  after reaching a high of 85.6 million barrels  13,610,000m3  per day in 2007  world consumption decreased in both 2008 and 2009 by a total of 1.8   despite fuel costs plummeting in 2008  despite this lull  world quantity-demanded for oil is projected to increase 21  over 2007 levels by 2030  104 million barrels per day  16.510 6m3 d  from 86 million barrels  13.710 6m3    or about 0.8  average annual growth  due in large part to increases in demand from the transportation sector  according to projections by the
 iea  in 2013  growth in global oil demand will be significantly outpaced by growth in production capacity over the next 5 years  developments in late 20142015 have seen an oversupply of global markets leading to a significant drop in the price of oil 
oil consumption per capita  darker colors represent more consumption  gray represents no data 
is distributed amongst four broad sectors  transportation    commercial  and industrial  in terms of oil use  transportation is the largest sector and the one that has seen the largest growth in demand in recent decades  this growth has largely come from new demand for personal-use vehicles powered by   this sector also has the highest consumption rates  accounting for approximately 71  of the oil used in the
in 2013  and 55  of oil use worldwide as documented in the   transportation is therefore of particular interest to those seeking to mitigate the effects of peak oil 
although demand growth is highest in the   the united states is the world s largest consumer of petroleum  between 1995 and 2005  us consumption grew from 17,700,000 barrels per day  2,810,000m3 d  to 20,700,000 barrels per day  3,290,000m3 d   a 3,000,000 barrels per day  480,000m3 d  increase  china  by comparison  increased consumption from 3,400,000 barrels per day  540,000m3 d  to 7,000,000 barrels per day  1,100,000m3 d   an increase of 3,600,000 barrels per day  570,000m3 d   in the same time frame  the
 eia  stated that gasoline usage in the united states may have peaked in 2007  in part because of increasing interest in and mandates for use of biofuels and energy efficiency 
as countries   industry and higher
drive up energy use  oil usage being a major component  thriving economies  such as
and   are quickly becoming large oil consumers  for example  china surpassed the united states as the world s largest crude oil importer in 2015  oil consumption growth is expected to continue  however  not at previous rates  as china s economic growth is predicted to decrease from the high rates of the early part of the 21st century  india s oil imports are expected to more than triple from 2005 levels by 2020  rising to 5 million barrels per day  790103 m3 d  
population  
world population
another significant factor affecting petroleum demand has been human   the
predicts that
in 2030 will be almost double that of 1980  oil production per capita peaked in 1979 at 5.5 barrels year but then declined to fluctuate around 4.5 barrels year since  in this regard  the decreasing population growth rate since the 1970s has somewhat ameliorated the per capita decline 
economic growth  
some analysts argue that the cost of oil has a profound effect on economic growth due to its pivotal role in the extraction of resources and the processing  manufacturing  and transportation of goods  as the industrial effort to extract new unconventional oil sources increases  this has a compounding negative effect on all sectors of the economy  leading to economic stagnation or even eventual contraction  such a scenario would result in an inability for national economies to pay high oil prices  leading to declining demand and a price collapse 
supply  
global liquids production 2000-2015  indicating the component of us tight oil  energy information administration 
our analysis suggests there are ample physical oil and liquid fuel resources for the foreseeable future  however  the rate at which new supplies can be developed and the break-even prices for those new supplies are changing 

defining sources of oil  
oil may come from conventional or unconventional sources  the terms are not strictly defined  and vary within the literature as definitions based on new technologies tend to change over time  as a result  different oil forecasting studies have included different classes of liquid fuels  some use the terms  conventional  oil for what is included in the model  and  unconventional  oil for classes excluded 
in 1956  hubbert confined his peak oil prediction to that crude oil  producible by methods now in use   by 1962  however  his analyses included future improvements in exploration and production  all of hubbert s analyses of peak oil specifically excluded oil manufactured from oil shale or mined from oil sands  a 2013 study predicting an early peak excluded deepwater oil  tight oil  oil with api gravity less than 17.5  and oil close to the poles  such as that on the north slope of alaska  all of which it defined as non-conventional  some commonly used definitions for conventional and unconventional oil are detailed below 
conventional sources  
conventional oil is extracted on land and offshore using standard techniques  and can be categorized as light  medium  heavy  or extra heavy in grade  the exact definitions of these grades vary depending on the region from which the oil came  light oil flows naturally to the surface or can be extracted by simply pumping it out of the ground  heavy refers to oil that has higher density and therefore lower   it does not flow easily  and its consistency is similar to that of molasses  while some of it can be produced using conventional techniques  recovery rates are better using unconventional methods 
unconventional sources  
oil currently considered unconventional is derived from multiple sources 
is extracted from deposits of low-permeability rock  sometimes shale deposits but often other rock types  using   or  fracking   it is often confused with shale oil  which is oil manufactured from the kerogen contained in an oil shale  see below   production of tight oil has led to a resurgence of us production in recent years  however  tight oil production peaked in 2015 and is not expected to increase again until there is a significant oil price recovery 
us lower 48 oil production from 2012 and anticipated decline in production to the end of 2017  with rig count  energy information administration 
is a common term for sedimentary rock such as
or   containing   a waxy oil precursor that has not yet been transformed into crude oil by the high pressures and temperatures caused by deep burial  the term  oil shale  is somewhat confusing  because what is referred to in the u s  as  oil shale  is not really oil and the rock it is found in is generally not shale  since it is close to the surface rather than buried deep in the earth  the shale or marl is typically mined  crushed  and   producing synthetic oil from the kerogen  its
is much lower than conventional oil  so much so that estimates of the net energy yield of shale discoveries are considered extremely unreliable 
are unconsolidated
deposits containing large amounts of very viscous crude
or extra- that can be recovered by
or by
oil wells using
or other techniques  it can be liquefied by   blending with   or by heating  and then processed by a conventional   the recovery process requires advanced
but is more efficient than that of oil shale  the reason is that  unlike u s   oil shale   canadian oil sands actually contain oil  and the sandstones they are found in are much easier to produce oil from than shale or marl  in the   these formations are often called  tar sands   but the material found in them is not tar but an extra-heavy and viscous form of oil technically known as

and   have synthetic oil technology proven to work on a commercial scale  sasol s primary business is based on ctl  coal-to-liquid  and gtl  natural gas-to-liquid  technology  producing us 4.40 billion in revenues  fy2009   shell has used these processes to recycle waste
 usually burnt off at oil wells and refineries  into usable synthetic oil  however  for ctl there may be insufficient coal reserves to supply global needs for both liquid fuels and electric power generation 
minor sources include   as discussed in a 2003 article in   that could be used to manufacture oil indefinitely  out of garbage  sewage  and agricultural waste  the article claimed that the cost of the process was  15 per barrel  a follow-up article in 2006 stated that the cost was actually  80 per barrel  because the feedstock that had previously been considered as hazardous waste now had market value  a 2008 news bulletin published by
proposed that
 possibly produced using hot fluid from nuclear reactors to
into hydrogen and oxygen  in combination with
could be used to produce
 ch3oh   which could then be converted into gasoline 
discoveries  
all the easy oil and gas in the world has pretty much been found  now comes the harder work in finding and producing oil from more challenging environments and work areas 
william j  cummings  exxon-mobil company spokesman  december 2005
it is pretty clear that there is not much chance of finding any significant quantity of new cheap oil  any new or unconventional oil is going to be expensive

world oil discoveries peaked in the 1960s
the peak of world oilfield discoveries occurred in the 1960s at around 55 billion barrels  8.7109m3  gb  year  according to the association for the study of peak oil and gas  aspo   the rate of discovery has been falling steadily since  less than 10 gb yr of oil were discovered each year between 2002 and 2007  according to a 2010 reuters article  the annual rate of discovery of new fields has remained remarkably constant at 1520 gb yr 
although us proved oil reserves grew by 3.8 billion barrels in 2011  even after deducting 2.07 billion barrels of production  only 8 percent of the 5.84 billion barrels of the newly booked oil was because of new field discoveries   
but despite the fall-off in new field discoveries  and record-high production rates  the reported proved reserves of crude oil remaining in the ground in 2014  which totaled 1,490 billion barrels  not counting canadian heavy oil sands  were more than quadruple the 1965 proved reserves of 354 billion barrels  a researcher for the
has pointed out that after the first wave of discoveries in an area  most oil and natural gas reserve growth comes not from discoveries of new fields  but from extensions and additional gas found within existing fields 
a report by the uk energy research centre noted that  discovery  is often used ambiguously  and explained the seeming contradiction between falling discovery rates since the 1960s and increasing reserves by the phenomenon of reserve growth  the report noted that increased reserves within a field may be discovered or developed by new technology years or decades after the original discovery  but because of the practice of  backdating   any new reserves within a field  even those to be discovered decades after the field discovery  are attributed to the year of initial field discovery  creating an illusion that discovery is not keeping pace with production

hubbert s 1956 peak projection for the united states depended on geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources  but starting in his 1962 publication  he concluded that ultimate oil recovery was an output of his mathematical analysis  rather than an assumption  he regarded his peak oil calculation as independent of reserve estimates 
many current 2p calculations predict reserves to be between 1150 and 1350 gb  but some authors have written that because of misinformation  withheld information  and misleading reserve calculations  2p reserves are likely nearer to 850900 gb  the energy watch group wrote that actual reserves peaked in 1980  when production first surpassed new discoveries  that apparent increases in reserves since then are illusory  and concluded  in 2007    probably the world oil production has peaked already  but we cannot be sure yet  
concerns over stated reserves  
 world  reserves are confused and in fact inflated  many of the so-called reserves are in fact resources  they re not delineated  they re not accessible  they re not available for production 
sadad i  al-husseini  former vp of   presentation to the oil and money conference  october 2007 
al-husseini estimated that 300 billion barrels  4810 9m3  of the world s 1,200 billion barrels  19010 9m3  of proven reserves should be recategorized as speculative resources 
graph of opec reported reserves showing jumps in stated reserves without associated discoveries  as well as the lack of depletion despite yearly production
one difficulty in forecasting the date of peak oil is the opacity surrounding the oil reserves classified as  proven   in many major producing countries  the majority of reserves claims have not been subject to outside audit or examination  many worrying signs concerning the depletion of proven reserves have emerged in recent years  this was best exemplified by the 2004 scandal surrounding the  evaporation  of 20  of  s reserves 
for the most part  proven reserves are stated by the oil companies  the producer states and the consumer states  all three have reasons to overstate their proven reserves  oil companies may look to increase their potential worth  producer countries gain a stronger   and governments of consumer countries may seek a means to foster sentiments of
and
within their
and among consumers 
major discrepancies arise from accuracy issues with the self-reported numbers from the
 opec   besides the possibility that these nations have overstated their reserves for political reasons  during periods of no substantial discoveries   over 70 nations also follow a practice of not reducing their reserves to account for yearly production  analysts have suggested that opec member nations have economic incentives to exaggerate their reserves  as the opec quota system allows greater output for countries with greater reserves 
  for example  was reported in the january 2006 issue of petroleum intelligence weekly to have only 48 billion barrels  7.610 9m3  in reserve  of which only 24 were fully proven  this report was based on the leak of a confidential document from kuwait and has not been formally denied by the kuwaiti authorities  this leaked document is from 2001  but excludes revisions or discoveries made since then  additionally  the reported 1.5 billion barrels  24010 6m3  of
by iraqi soldiers in the
are conspicuously missing from kuwait s figures 
on the other hand  investigative journalist
argues that oil companies have an interest in making oil look more rare than it is  to justify higher prices  this view is contested by ecological journalist   other analysts argue that oil producing countries understate the extent of their reserves to drive up the price 
the eur reported by the 2000 usgs survey of 2,300 billion barrels  37010 9m3  has been criticized for assuming a discovery trend over the next twenty years that would reverse the observed trend of the past 40 years  their 95  confidence eur of 2,300 billion barrels  37010 9m3  assumed that discovery levels would stay steady  despite the fact that new-field discovery rates have declined since the 1960s  that trend of falling discoveries has continued in the ten years since the usgs made their assumption  the 2000 usgs is also criticized for other assumptions  as well as assuming 2030 production rates inconsistent with projected reserves

texas oil production declined since peaking in 1972 but has recently had a resurgence due to tight oil production
reserve estimates are based on the oil price  hence  unconventional sources such as heavy crude oil  oil sands  and oil shale may be included as new techniques reduce the cost of extraction  with rule changes by the   oil companies can now book them as proven reserves after opening a
or thermal facility for   these unconventional sources are more labor and resource intensive to produce  however  requiring extra energy to refine  resulting in higher production costs and up to three times more
emissions per barrel  or barrel equivalent  on a  well to tank  basis or 10 to 45  more on a  well to wheels  basis  which includes the carbon emitted from combustion of the final product 
while the energy used  resources needed  and environmental effects of extracting unconventional sources have traditionally been prohibitively high  major
sources being considered for large-scale production are the extra heavy oil in the

estimates that   taken together  these resource occurrences  in the   are approximately equal to the identified reserves of conventional crude oil accredited to the middle east   authorities familiar with the resources believe that the world s ultimate reserves of unconventional oil are several times as large as those of conventional oil and will be highly profitable for companies as a result of higher prices in the 21st century  in october 2009  the
updated the orinoco tar sands  venezuela  recoverable  mean value  to 513 billion barrels  8.161010m3   with a 90  chance of being within the range of 380-652 billion barrels  103.710 9m3   making this area  one of the world s largest recoverable oil accumulations  
unconventional resources are much larger than conventional ones
despite the large quantities of oil available in non-conventional sources  matthew simmons argued in 2005 that limitations on production prevent them from becoming an effective substitute for conventional crude oil  simmons stated  these are high energy intensity projects that can never reach high volumes  to offset significant losses from other sources  another study claims that even under highly optimistic assumptions   canada s oil sands will not prevent peak oil   although production could reach 5,000,000bbl d  790,000m3 d  by 2030 in a  crash program  development effort 
moreover  oil extracted from these sources typically contains contaminants such as
and
that are energy-intensive to extract and can leave   ponds containing hydrocarbon sludge  in some cases  the same applies to much of the  s undeveloped conventional oil reserves  much of which is heavy  viscous  and contaminated with sulfur and metals to the point of being unusable  however

to the petroleum
equation  others believe that the increasing industrial effort to extract oil will have a negative effect on global economic growth  leading to demand contraction and a price collapse  thereby causing production decline as some unconventional sources become uneconomical  yet others believe that the peak may be to some extent led by declining demand as new technologies and improving efficiency shift energy usage away from oil

the increasing investment in harder-to-reach oil is a sign of oil companies  belief in the end of easy oil  also  while it is widely believed that increased oil prices spur an increase in production  an increasing number of oil industry insiders were reportedly coming to believe that even with higher prices  oil production was unlikely to increase significantly  among the reasons cited were both geological factors as well as  above ground  factors that are likely to see oil production plateau 
an important concept with regard to declining  easy oil  is   also referred to as eroei  a 2008 journal of energy security analysis of the energy return on drilling effort in the united states concluded that there was extremely limited potential to increase production of both gas and  especially  oil  by looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort  the analysis showed very little increase of production attributable to increased drilling  this was because of a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort  as drilling effort increased  the energy obtained per active
was reduced according to a severely diminishing   the study concluded that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to significantly increase oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region such as the united states  however  contrary to the study s conclusion  since the analysis was published in 2008  us production of crude oil has increased 74   and production of dry natural gas has increased 28   2014 compared to 2008

whether the world economy can grow and maintain demand for such a high oil price remains to be seen 
oil field decline  
alaska s oil production has declined 70  since peaking in 1988
in a 2013 study of 733 giant oil fields  only 32  of the ultimately recoverable oil  condensate and gas remained    which is the largest oil field in the world and responsible for approximately half of saudi arabia s oil production over the last 50years  was in decline before 2009  the world s second largest oil field  the
in kuwait  entered decline in november 2005 
it is well established that once an oilfield reaches maximum production  it will decrease at a certain decline rate  for example  mexico announced that production from its giant
began to decline in march 2006  reportedly at a rate of 13  per year  also in 2006 
senior vice president abdullah saif estimated that its existing fields were declining at a rate of 5  to 12  per year  according to a study of the largest 811 oilfields conducted in early 2008 by   the average rate of field decline is 4.5  per year  the association for the study of peak oil and gas agreed with their decline rates  but considered the rate of new fields coming online overly optimistic  the
stated in november 2008 that an analysis of 800 oilfields showed the decline in oil production to be 6.7  a year for fields past their peak  and that this would grow to 8.6  in 2030  a more rapid annual rate of decline of 5.1  in 800 of the world s largest oil fields weighted for production over their whole lives was reported by the
in their   the 2013 study of 733 giant fields mentioned previously had an average decline rate 3.83  which was described as  conservative  
control over supply  
entities such as governments or cartels can reduce supply to the world market by limiting access to the supply through nationalizing oil  cutting back on production  limiting drilling rights  imposing taxes  etc  international sanctions  corruption  and military conflicts can also reduce supply 
nationalization of oil supplies  
main article 
another factor affecting global oil supply is the
of oil reserves by producing nations  the nationalization of oil occurs as countries begin to
oil production and withhold exports  kate dourian  platts  middle east editor  points out that while estimates of oil reserves may vary  politics have now entered the equation of oil supply   some countries are becoming off limits  major oil companies operating in venezuela find themselves in a difficult position because of the growing nationalization of that resource  these countries are now reluctant to share their reserves  
according to consulting firm   only 7  of the world s estimated oil and gas reserves are in countries that allow companies like exxonmobil free rein  fully 65  are in the hands of state-owned companies such as saudi aramco  with the rest in countries such as russia and venezuela  where access by western european and north american companies is difficult  the pfc study implies political factors are limiting capacity increases in   venezuela        and russia  saudi arabia is also limiting capacity expansion  but because of a self-imposed cap  unlike the other countries  as a result of not having access to countries amenable to oil exploration  exxonmobil is not making nearly the investment in finding new oil that it did in 1981

alternatively  commodities trader raymond learsy  author of over a barrel  breaking the middle east oil cartel  contends that opec has trained consumers to believe that oil is a much more finite resource than it is  to back his argument  he points to past false alarms and apparent collaboration  he also believes that peak oil analysts are conspiring with opec and the oil companies to create a  fabricated drama of peak oil  to drive up oil prices and   oil had risen to a little over  30 barrel at that time  a counter-argument was given in the huffington post after he and steve andrews  co-founder of aspo  debated on cnbc in june 2007

a selection of estimates of the year of peak world oil production  compiled by the united states energy information administration
in 1962  hubbert predicted that world oil production would peak at a rate of 12.5 billion barrels per year  around the year 2000  in 1974  hubbert predicted that peak oil would occur in 1995  if current trends continue   those predictions proved incorrect  however  a number of industry leaders and analysts believe that world oil production will peak between 2015 and 2030  with a significant chance that the peak will occur before 2020  they consider dates after 2030 implausible  by comparison  a 2014 analysis of production and reserve data predicted a peak in oil production about 2035  determining a more specific range is difficult due to the lack of certainty over the actual size of world oil reserves  unconventional oil is not currently predicted to meet the expected shortfall even in a best-case scenario  for unconventional oil to fill the gap without  potentially serious impacts on the global economy   oil production would have to remain stable after its peak  until 2035 at the earliest 
papers published since 2010 have been relatively pessimistic  a 2010
study predicted production would peak in 2014  a 2010
study predicted that production will peak before 2015  but its projection of a change soon     from a demand-led market to a supply constrained market     was incorrect  a 2014 validation of a significant 2004 study in the journal energy proposed that it is likely that conventional oil production peaked  according to various definitions  between 2005 and 2011  a set of models published in a 2014 ph d  thesis predicted that a 2012 peak would be followed by a drop in oil prices  which in some scenarios could turn into a rapid rise in prices thereafter  according to energy blogger ron patterson  the peak of world oil production was probably around 2010 
major oil companies hit peak production in 2005  several sources in 2006 and 2007 predicted that worldwide production was at or past its maximum    chief economist at the   also stated that  crude oil production for the world has already peaked in 2006   however  in 2013 opec s figures showed that world crude oil production and remaining proven reserves were at record highs  according to   former chairman of
and author of twilight in the desert  the coming saudi oil shock and the world economy   peaking is one of these fuzzy events that you only know clearly when you see it through a rear view mirror  and by then an alternate resolution is generally too late  
possible consequences

and
the wide use of fossil fuels has been one of the most important stimuli of
and prosperity since the   allowing humans to participate in takedown  or the consumption of energy at a greater rate than it is being replaced  some believe that when oil production decreases  human culture  and modern technological society will be forced to change drastically  the impact of peak oil will depend heavily on the rate of decline and the development and adoption of  
in 2005  the
published a report titled peaking of world oil production  impacts  mitigation    risk management  known as the   it stated   the peaking of world oil production presents the u s  and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem  as peaking is approached  liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically  and  without timely mitigation  the economic  social  and political costs will be unprecedented  viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides  but to have substantial impact  they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking   some of the information was updated in 2007

historical oil prices  
long-term oil prices  18612015  top line adjusted for inflation 
the oil price historically was comparatively low until the
and the
when it increased more than tenfold during that six-year timeframe  even though the oil price dropped significantly in the following years  it has never come back to the previous levels  oil price began to increase again during the 2000s until it hit historical heights of  143 per barrel  2007 inflation adjusted dollars  on 30 june 2008  as these prices were well above those that caused
and   they contributed to fears of an economic recession similar to that of the early 1980s 
it is generally agreed that the main reason for the price spike in 20052008 was strong demand pressure  for example  global consumption of oil rose from 30 billion barrels  4.810 9m3  in 2004 to 31 billion in 2005  the consumption rates were far above new discoveries in the period  which had fallen to only eight billion barrels of new oil reserves in new accumulations in 2004 
asset write downs for oil companies 2015
oil price increases were partially fueled by reports that petroleum production is at or near full capacity  in june 2005  opec stated that they would  struggle  to pump enough oil to meet pricing pressures for the fourth quarter of that year  from 2007 to 2008  the decline in the u s  dollar against other significant currencies was also considered as a significant reason for the oil price increases  as the dollar lost approximately 14  of its value against the euro from may 2007 to may 2008 
besides supply and demand pressures  at times security related factors may have contributed to increases in prices  including the   missile launches in   the   nuclear

depicts eia projections for west texas intermediate crude oil price for 2016-2017
more recently  between 2011 and 2014 the price of crude oil was relatively stable  fluctuating around  us100 per barrel  it dropped sharply in late 2014 to below  us70 where it remained for most of 2015  in early 2016 it traded at a low of  us27  the price drop has been attributed to both oversupply and reduced demand as a result of the slowing global economy  opec reluctance to concede market share  and a stronger us dollar  these factors may be exacerbated by a combination of monetary policy and the increased debt of oil producers  who may increase production to maintain liquidity 
this price drop has placed many us tight oil producers under considerable financial pressure  as a result  there has been a reduction by oil companies in capital expenditure of over  us400 billion  it is anticipated that this will have effects on global production in the longer term  leading to statements of concern by the international energy agency that governments should not be complacent about energy security  energy information agency projections anticipate market oversupply and prices below  us50 until late 2017

or   this substitution can be only temporary  as coal and natural gas are finite resources as well 
prior to the run-up in fuel prices  many motorists opted for larger  less fuel-efficient
and full-sized pickups in the united states  canada  and other countries  this trend has been reversing because of sustained high prices of fuel  the september 2005 sales data for all vehicle vendors indicated suv sales dropped while small cars sales increased 
and
vehicles are also gaining in popularity 
eia published household vehicles energy use  latest data and trends in nov 2005 illustrating the steady increase in disposable income and  2030 per barrel price of oil in 2004  the report notes  the average household spent  1,520 on fuel purchases for transport   according to cnbc that expense climbed to  4,155 in 2011 
in 2008  a report by
stated that 2007 had been the year of peak gasoline usage in the united states  and that record energy prices would cause an  enduring shift  in energy consumption practices  the total miles driven in the u s  peaked in 2006 
the
states that after peak oil petroleum exporting countries will be forced to reduce their exports more quickly than their production decreases because of internal demand growth  countries that rely on imported petroleum will therefore be affected earlier and more dramatically than exporting countries  mexico is already in this situation  internal consumption grew by 5.9  in 2006 in the five biggest exporting countries  and their exports declined by over 3   it was estimated that by 2010 internal demand would decrease worldwide exports by 2,500,000 barrels per day  400,000m3 d  
canadian economist jeff rubin has stated that high oil prices are likely to result in increased consumption in developed countries through partial manufacturing de-globalisation of trade  manufacturing production would move closer to the end consumer to minimise transportation network costs  and therefore a demand decoupling from gross domestic product would occur  higher oil prices would lead to increased freighting costs and consequently  the manufacturing industry would move back to the developed countries since freight costs would outweigh the current economic wage advantage of developing countries  economic research carried out by the

a majority of americans live in   a type of low-density settlement designed around universal personal
use  commentators such as
argue that because over 90  of transportation in the u s  relies on oil  the suburbs  reliance on the automobile is an unsustainable living arrangement  peak oil would leave many americans unable to afford petroleum based fuel for their cars  and force them to use
or   additional options include   moving to   or moving to higher density areas  where
and
are more viable options  in the latter two cases  suburbs may become the   of the future   the issue of petroleum supply and demand is also a concern for growing cities in developing countries  where urban areas are expected to absorb most of the world s projected 2.3 billion population increase by 2050   stressing the energy component of future development plans is seen as an important goal 
rising oil prices  if they occur  would also affect the cost of food  heating  and electricity  a high amount of stress would then be put on current middle to low income families as economies contract from the decline in excess funds  decreasing employment rates  the hirsch us doe report concludes that  without timely mitigation  world supply demand balance will be achieved through massive demand destruction  shortages   accompanied by huge oil price increases  both of which would create a long period of significant economic hardship worldwide  
methods that have been suggested for mitigating these urban and suburban issues include the use of non-petroleum vehicles such as                       and  
an extensive 2009 report on the effects of compact development by the
of the   commissioned by the united states congress  stated six main findings  first  that compact development is likely to reduce  vehicle miles traveled   vmt  throughout the country  second  that doubling residential density in a given area could reduce vmt by as much as 25  if coupled with measures such as increased employment density and improved public transportation  third  that higher density  mixed-use developments would produce both direct reductions in co2 emissions  from less driving   and indirect reductions  such as from lower amounts of materials used per housing unit  higher efficiency climate control  longer vehicle lifespans  and higher efficiency delivery of goods and services   fourth  that although short term reductions in energy use and co2 emissions would be modest  that these reductions would become more significant over time  fifth  that a major obstacle to more compact development in the united states is political resistance from local zoning regulators  which would hamper efforts by state and regional governments to participate in land-use planning  sixth  the committee agreed that changes in development that would alter driving patterns and building efficiency would have various secondary costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify  the report recommends that policies supporting compact development  and especially its ability to reduce driving  energy use  and co2 emissions  should be encouraged 
an economic theory that has been proposed as a remedy is the introduction of a   such a system could include a tax shifting from income to depleting natural resources  and pollution   as well as the limitation of advertising that stimulates demand and population growth  it could also include the institution of policies that move away from globalization and toward localization to conserve energy resources  provide local jobs  and maintain local decision-making authority  zoning policies could be adjusted to promote resource conservation and eliminate sprawl 
mitigation  
main article 
to avoid the serious
and
implications a global decline in oil production could entail  the
emphasized the need to find alternatives  at least ten to twenty years before the peak  and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time  this was similar to
that same year  such
could include energy conservation  fuel substitution  and the use of unconventional oil  the timing of mitigation responses is critical  premature initiation would be undesirable  but if initiated too late could be more costly and have more negative economic consequences 
positive aspects  
sees peak oil as holding tremendous potential for positive change  assuming countries act with foresight  the rebuilding of local food networks  energy production  and the general implementation of   culture  are argued to be ethical responses to the acknowledgment of finite fossil resources  majorca is an island currently diversifying its energy supply from fossil fuels to alternative sources and looking back at traditional construction and permaculture methods 
the
movement  started in  
and spread internationally by  the transition handbook     and transition network  sees the restructuring of society for more local resilience and ecological stewardship as a natural response to the combination of peak oil and climate change 
criticisms  
general arguments  
opponents to the theory of peak oil often cite new oil reserves that have been found  which continue to forestall a peak oil event  in particular  some contend that oil production from these new oil reserves as well as from existing fields will continue to increase at a rate that outpaces demand  until alternate energy sources for our current
are found  as of 2015  analysts in both the petroleum and financial industries were concluding that the  age of oil  had already reached a new stage where the excess supply that appeared in late 2014 may continue to prevail in the future  a consensus appeared to be emerging that an international agreement will be reached to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2c that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels 
further criticism against peak oil is confidence in the various options and technologies for   and indeed there are some promising approaches that seem to have the potential to reduce or even counterbalance the effects of a peak oil situation  for example  us federal funding has increased for
since the year 2000 due to rising fuel prices  numerous more projects are being funded in australia  new zealand  europe  the middle east  and other parts of the world and private companies are entering the field 
oil industry representatives  
oil industry representatives have criticised peak oil theory  at least as it has been presented by   the president of  s u s  operations john hofmeister  while agreeing that conventional oil production would soon start to decline  criticized simmons s analysis for being  overly focused on a single country  saudi arabia  the world s largest exporter and opec    he also pointed to the large reserves at the us   which held an estimated 100 billion barrels  1610 9m3  of oil and natural gas  however  only 15  of those reserves were currently exploitable  a good part of that off the coasts of louisiana  alabama  mississippi  and texas  hofmeister also contended that simmons erred in excluding unconventional sources of oil such as the oil sands of canada  where shell was active  the canadian oil sandsa natural combination of sand  water  and oil found largely in alberta and saskatchewanare believed to contain one trillion barrels of oil  another trillion barrels are also said to be trapped in rocks in colorado  utah  and wyoming  but are in the form of   these particular reserves present major environmental  social  and economic obstacles to recovery  hofmeister also claimed that if oil companies were allowed to drill more in the united states enough to produce another 2 million barrels per day  32010 3m3 d   oil and gas prices would not be as high as they were in the later part of the 2000 to 2010 decade  he thought in 2008 that high energy prices would cause social unrest similar to the  
in 2009  dr  christoph rhl  chief economist of   argued against the peak oil hypothesis 
physical peak oil  which i have no reason to accept as a valid statement either on theoretical  scientific or ideological grounds  would be insensitive to prices     in fact the whole hypothesis of peak oil  which is that there is a certain amount of oil in the ground  consumed at a certain rate  and then it s finished  does not react to anything    therefore there will never be a moment when the world runs out of oil because there will always be a price at which the last drop of oil can clear the market  and you can turn anything into oil into if you are willing to pay the financial and environmental price     global warming  is likely to be more of a natural limit than all these peak oil theories combined     peak oil has been predicted for 150 years  it has never happened  and it will stay this way 
according to rhl  the main limitations for oil availability are  above ground  and are to be found in the availability of staff  expertise  technology  investment security  money and last but not least in global warming  the oil question is about price and not the basic availability  rhl s views are shared by
of   who added that the recent high price phase might add to a future demise of the oil industry  not of complete exhaustion of resources or an apocalyptic shock but the timely and smooth setup of alternatives
