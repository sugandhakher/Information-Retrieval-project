diesel fuel
in general is any liquid
used in   whose fuel ignition takes place  without spark  as a result of compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel     grid heaters and heater blocks help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather   diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher
and thus   this is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load  as their air supply is not throttled as in a   their efficiency still remains very high 
the most common type of diesel fuel is a specific
of petroleum   but alternatives that are not derived from petroleum  such as  
 btl  or
 gtl  diesel  are increasingly being developed and adopted  to distinguish these types  petroleum-derived diesel is increasingly called petrodiesel 
 ulsd  is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered
contents  as of 2016  almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in uk  europe and north america is of a ulsd type  in the uk  diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated derv  standing for diesel-engined road vehicle  which carries a tax premium over equivalent fuel for

origins  
diesel fuel originated from experiments conducted by german scientist and inventor
for his
he invented in 1892  diesel originally designed his engine to use coal dust as fuel  and experimented with other fuels including vegetable oils such as   which was used to power the engines which he exhibited at the
and the 1911 world s fair in paris 
types  
diesel fuel is produced from various sources  the most common being   other sources include         and  
petroleum diesel  
a modern diesel dispenser
petroleum diesel  also called petrodiesel  or fossil diesel is the most common type of diesel fuel  it is produced from the
of
between 200c  392f  and 350c  662f  at   resulting in a mixture of carbon chains that typically contain between 8 and 21
per  
synthetic diesel  
main article 
synthetic diesel can be produced from any carbonaceous material  including biomass  biogas  natural gas  coal and many others  the raw material is gasified into synthesis gas  which after purification is converted by the
to a synthetic diesel 
the process is typically referred to as
 btl  
 gtl  or
 ctl   depending on the raw material used 
paraffinic synthetic diesel generally has a near-zero content of sulfur and very low aromatics content  reducing unregulated emissions of toxic hydrocarbons  nitrous oxides and particulate matter  pm  
biodiesel  
main article 
biodiesel made from
oil
fatty-acid methyl ester  fame   more widely known as   is obtained from
or animal fats  bio  which have been
with   it can be produced from many types of oils  the most common being
oil  rapeseed methyl ester  rme  in europe and
 soy methyl ester  sme  in the us  methanol can also be replaced with ethanol for the transesterification process  which results in the production of ethyl esters  the transesterification processes use catalysts  such as sodium or potassium hydroxide  to convert vegetable oil and methanol into fame and the undesirable byproducts glycerine and water  which will need to be removed from the fuel along with methanol traces  fame can be used pure  b100  in engines where the manufacturer approves such use  but it is more often used as a mix with diesel  bxx where xx is the biodiesel content in percent 
fame as a fuel is regulated under
and  
fame has a lower energy content than diesel due to its oxygen content  and as a result  performance and fuel consumption can be affected  it also can have higher levels of nox emissions  possibly even exceeding the legal limit  fame also has lower oxidation stability than diesel  and it offers favorable conditions for bacterial growth  so applications which have a low fuel turnover should not use fame  the loss in power when using pure biodiesel is 57  
fuel equipment manufacturers  fie  have raised several concerns regarding fame fuels  free methanol  dissolved and free water  free glycerin 
and   free   total solid impurity levels  alkaline metal compounds in solution and oxidation and thermal stability  they have also identified fame as being the cause of the following problems  corrosion of fuel injection components  low-pressure fuel system blockage  increased dilution and
of engine sump oil  pump seizures due to high fuel viscosity at low temperature  increased injection pressure  elastomeric seal failures and fuel injector spray blockage 
are the source for the lower oxidation stability  they react with oxygen and form peroxides and result in degradation byproducts  which can cause sludge and lacquer in the fuel system 
as fame contains low levels of sulfur  the emissions of
and   major components of   are low  use of biodiesel also results in reductions of unburned hydrocarbons 
 co   and particulate matter  co emissions using biodiesel are substantially reduced  on the order of 50  compared to most petrodiesel fuels  the exhaust emissions of particulate matter from biodiesel have been found to be 30  lower than overall particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel  the exhaust emissions of total hydrocarbons  a contributing factor in the localized formation of smog and ozone  are up to 93  lower for biodiesel than diesel fuel 
biodiesel also may reduce health risks associated with petroleum diesel  biodiesel emissions showed decreased levels of
 pah  and nitrited pah compounds  which have been identified as potential cancer-causing compounds  in recent testing  pah compounds were reduced by 7585   except for   which was reduced by roughly 50   targeted npah compounds were also reduced dramatically with biodiesel fuel  with
and
reduced by 90   and the rest of the npah compounds reduced to only trace levels 
hydrogenated oils and fats  
this category of diesel fuels involves converting the
in vegetable oil and animal fats into alkanes by
and   such as   the produced fuel has many properties that are similar to synthetic diesel  and are free from the many disadvantages of fame 
dme  
  dme  is a synthetic  gaseous diesel fuel that results in clean combustion with very little soot and reduced nox emissions 
storage  
in the us  diesel is recommended to be stored in a yellow container to differentiate it from
and   which are typically kept in blue and red containers  respectively  in the uk  diesel is normally stored in a black container  to differentiate it from unleaded petrol  which is commonly stored in a green container  and leaded petrol  which is stored in a red container  
measurements and pricing  
cetane number  
main article 
the principal measure of diesel fuel quality is its   a cetane number is a measure of the delay of ignition of a diesel fuel  a higher cetane number indicates that the fuel ignites more readily when sprayed into hot compressed air  european  en 590 standard  road diesel has a minimum cetane number of 51  fuels with higher cetane numbers  normally  premium  diesel fuels with additional cleaning agents and some synthetic content  are available in some markets 
fuel value and price  
further information 
as of 2010  the density of petroleum diesel is about 0.832kg l  6.943lb usgal   about 11.6  more than ethanol-free   which has a density of about 0.745kg l  6.217lb usgal   about 86.1  of the fuel mass is carbon  and when burned  it offers a net heating value of 43.1 mj kg as opposed to 43.2 mj kg for gasoline  however  due to the higher density  diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density at 35.86 mj l  128,700btu usgal  vs  32.18 mj l  115,500btu usgal  for gasoline  some 11  higher  which should be considered when comparing the fuel efficiency by volume  the co2 emissions from diesel are 73.25 g mj  just slightly lower than for gasoline at 73.38 g mj  diesel is generally simpler to refine from petroleum than gasoline  and contains hydrocarbons having a boiling point in the range of 180360c  360680f   the price of diesel traditionally rises during colder months as demand for
rises  which is refined in much the same way  because of recent changes in fuel quality regulations  additional refining is required to remove sulfur  which contributes to a sometimes higher cost  in many parts of the united states and throughout the united kingdom and australia  diesel may be priced higher than petrol  reasons for higher-priced diesel include the shutdown of some refineries in the   diversion of mass refining capacity to gasoline production  and a recent transfer to
 ulsd   which causes infrastructural complications  in sweden  a diesel fuel designated as mk-1  class 1 environmental diesel  is also being sold  this is a ulsd that also has a lower aromatics content  with a limit of 5   this fuel is slightly more expensive to produce than regular ulsd 
taxation  
diesel fuel is very similar to   which is used in   in europe  the united states  and canada 
on diesel fuel are higher than on heating oil due to the   and in those areas  heating oil is marked with
and trace chemicals to prevent and detect    untaxed  diesel  sometimes called  off-road diesel   is available in some countries for use primarily in agricultural applications  such as fuel for tractors  recreational and utility vehicles or other
vehicles that do not use   this fuel may have sulfur levels that exceed the limits for road use in some countries  e g  us  
this untaxed diesel is dyed red for identification  and using this untaxed diesel fuel for a typically taxed purpose  such as driving use   the user can be fined  e g  us 10,000 in the us   in the united kingdom  belgium and the netherlands  it is known as
 or gas oil   and is also used in
vehicles  home heating tanks  refrigeration units on vans trucks which contain perishable items such as food and medicine and for marine craft  diesel fuel  or marked gas oil is dyed green in the republic of ireland and norway  the term  diesel-engined road vehicle   derv  is used in the uk as a synonym for unmarked road diesel fuel  in india  taxes on diesel fuel are lower than on petrol  as the majority of the transportation for grain and other essential commodities across the country runs on diesel 
taxes on
in the us vary between states  some states  texas  for example  have no tax on biodiesel and a reduced tax on biodiesel blends equivalent to the amount of biodiesel in the blend  so that b20 fuel is taxed 20  less than pure petrodiesel  other states  such as north carolina  tax biodiesel  in any blended configuration  the same as petrodiesel  although they have introduced new incentives to producers and users of all biofuels 
uses  
unlike
and
engines  diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition  spark plugs   an engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures   from 14 1 to 18 1 are common in current diesel engines   the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder  starting a few degrees before
 tdc  and continuing during the combustion event  the high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix  burn or    heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal pressure difference into mechanical work  i e   to move the piston  engines have
and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum   diesel engines are lean burn engines  burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction  they thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a
air-fuel ratio  just enough air to react with the fuel   as professor harvey of the university of toronto notes   due to the absence of throttling  constant amount of air admitted  per unit fuel  with no user-determined variation   and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture  diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines   generally  harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of schipper et al  and the estimates of  20  lower fuel use and  given difference in differences in energy content between fuel types   15  lower energy use 
and some other types of internal combustion engines  and   both can also be designed to take diesel fuel   
the
requirement of diesel fuel is usually specified at 40c  a disadvantage of diesel as a vehicle fuel in cold climates  is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases  changing it into a
 see   that cannot flow in fuel systems  special
contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures  but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties  another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol gasoline engines is the possibility of
failure  since diesel engines do not need spark ignition  they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied  fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump  if the pump breaks down in an  open  position  the supply of fuel will be unrestricted  and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure 
with
engines  the oil seals on the turbocharger may fail  allowing lubricating oil into the combustion chamber  where it is burned like regular diesel fuel  in vehicles or installations that use diesel engines and also   a gas leak into the engine room could also provide fuel for a runaway  via the engine air intake 
the crank case ventilation of modern road-use diesel engines is diverted into the intake manifold  because ventilating the crank case into outside air is inadvisable due to lubricant mist it contains  if the engine s piston rings malfunction  this will cause excessive pressure in the crank case forcing mist of engine lubricant into the intake manifold  since most engines use oil which can be burnt in the same fashion as diesel  this will result in   to prevent that  more premium crank case ventilation solutions are fitted with a filter to catch out lubricant mist 
most modern road use diesel engines are provided with an
valve in the intake manifold  usually mistaken by some as a petrol engine throttle body   in most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off  preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen  this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum  in more advanced control systems this frp valve can be shut by an
when it senses runaway scenario

aircraft  
packard dr-980 9-cylinder diesel aircraft engine
main article 
the first diesel-powered flight of a fixed-wing aircraft took place on the evening of 18 september 1928  at the
near   with captain
and
at the controls the first  official  test flight was taken the next morning  flying a
 x7654   powered by a
9-cylinder diesel   designed by woolson 
flew the same aircraft and in 1929  it was flown 621 miles  999km  nonstop from
to   near   in 1931  walter lees and fredrick brossy set the nonstop flight record flying a

diesel engines for airships were developed in both germany and the united kingdom by
and
produced the
and
respectively  the
rigid airship was powered by four
16-cylinder diesel engines  each with 1,200hp  890kw  available in bursts and 850 horsepower  630kw  available for cruising  the
powered the ill-fated
airship  built for the empire airship programme in 1931 
with a production run of at least 900 engines  the most-produced aviation diesel engine in history was probably the   similar developments from the
and licence-built versions of the
and   boosted german diesel aero-engine production to at least 1000 examples  the vast majority of which were liquid-cooled  opposed-piston  two-stroke engines 
in the
significant progress towards practical diesel aero-engines was made by the
 tsentral nyy institut aviatsionnovo motorostroyeniya  central institute of aviation motors  and particularly by   who nursed the
into production and limited operational use 
military vehicles  
use diesel because of its lower flammability risks and the engines  higher provision of torque and lower likelihood of  
cars  
cars generally have a better
than equivalent gasoline engines and produce less
emission  their greater economy is due to the higher energy per-litre content of diesel fuel and the intrinsic efficiency of the diesel engine  while petrodiesel s higher density results in higher greenhouse gas emissions per litre compared to gasoline  the 2040  better fuel economy achieved by modern diesel-engined automobiles offsets the higher per-litre emissions of greenhouse gases  and a diesel-powered vehicle emits 1020 percent less greenhouse gas than comparable gasoline vehicles  -powered diesel engines offer substantially improved emission reductions compared to petrodiesel or gasoline-powered engines  while retaining most of the fuel economy advantages over conventional gasoline-powered automobiles  however  the increased compression ratios mean there are increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen  nox  from diesel engines  this is compounded by biological nitrogen in biodiesel to make nox emissions the main drawback of diesel versus gasoline engines 
tractors and heavy equipment  
today s
and
are mostly diesel-powered  among tractors  only the smaller classes may also offer gasoline engines  the
of tractors and heavy equipment began in germany before world war ii but was unusual in the united states until after that war  during the 1950s and 1960s  it progressed in the latter country as well 
tractors and heavy equipment were often
in the 1920s through 1940s  running spark-ignition and low-compression engines  thus many farm tractors of the era could burn gasoline      and any light grade of
such as diesel fuel    or   according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time  on u s  farms during this era  the name  distillate  often referred to any of the aforementioned light fuel oils  the engines did not start as well on distillate  so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting  and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later  after warm-up  to switch to distillate  engine accessories such as
and
were also used  both with the aim of capturing heat  because when such an engine was run on distillate  it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature  dieselization with dedicated diesel engines  high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition  replaced such systems and made more
use of the diesel fuel being burned 
other uses  
poor quality diesel fuel has been used as an extraction agent for
of
from
mixtures  such use has been proposed as a means of separating the
palladium from
which comes from used   in this system of solvent extraction  the
of the diesel act as the
while the di
act as the extractant  this extraction operates by a
mechanism  so far  neither a
nor full scale plant has been constructed to recover palladium 
or
from
created by the use of  
diesel fuel is also often used as the main ingredient in oil-base mud drilling fluid  the advantage of using diesel is its low cost and that it delivers excellent results when drilling a wide variety of difficult strata including shale  salt and gypsum formations  diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40  brine water  due to health  safety and environmental concerns  diesel-oil mud is often replaced with vegetable  mineral  or synthetic food-grade oil-base drilling fluids  although diesel-oil mud is still in widespread use in certain regions 
during development of rocket engines in
during
j-2 diesel fuel was used as the fuel component in several engines including the   j-2 diesel fuel was also used as a fuel for gas turbine engines 
chemical analysis  
chemical composition  
diesel
with water 
petroleum-derived diesel is composed of about 75 
 primarily
including     and    and 25 
 including
and    the average chemical formula for common diesel fuel is c12h23  ranging approximately from c10h20 to c15h28 
chemical properties  
further information 
and
most diesel fuels freeze at common winter temperatures  while the temperatures greatly vary  petrodiesel typically freezes around temperatures of 8.1c  17.5f   whereas biodiesel freezes between temperatures of 2 to 15c  35 to 60f   the viscosity of diesel noticeably increases as the temperature decreases  changing it into a gel at temperatures of 19c  2.2f  to 15c  5f   that cannot flow in fuel systems  conventional diesel fuels vaporise at temperatures between 149c and 371c 
conventional diesel
vary between 52 and 96c  which makes it safer than petrol and unsuitable for spark-ignition engines  unlike petrol  the flash point of a diesel fuel has no relation to its performance in an engine nor to its auto ignition qualities 
hazards  
reduction of sulfur emissions  
in the past  diesel fuel contained higher quantities of  
and preferential taxation have forced
to dramatically reduce the level of sulfur in diesel fuels  in the european union  the sulfur content has dramatically reduced during the last 20 years  automotive diesel fuel is covered in the european union by standard   in the 1990s specifications allowed a content of 2000 ppm max of sulphur  reduced to a limit of 350 ppm by the beginning of the 21st century with the introduction of euro 3 specifications  the limit was lowered with the introduction of euro 4 by 2006 to 50 ppm    ultra low sulfur diesel   the standard currently in force in european europe for diesel fuel is the euro 5  with a maximum content of 10 ppm

in the united states  more stringent emission standards have been adopted with the transition to
starting in 2006  and becoming mandatory on june 1  2010  see also    u s  diesel fuel typically also has a lower
 a measure of ignition quality  than european diesel  resulting in worse cold weather performance and some increase in emissions 
environment hazards of sulfur  
high levels of sulfur in diesel are harmful for the environment because they prevent the use of catalytic
to control   as well as more advanced technologies  such as nitrogen oxide   
 still under development   to reduce emissions  moreover  sulfur in the fuel is oxidized during combustion  producing
and   that in presence of water rapidly convert to   one of the chemical processes that results in   however  the process for lowering sulfur also reduces the
of the fuel  meaning that
must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines 
and biodiesel petrodiesel blends  with their higher lubricity levels  are increasingly being utilized as an alternative  the u s  annual consumption of diesel fuel in 2006 was about 190 billion litres  42 billion imperial gallons or 50 billion us gallons  
algae  microbes  and water contamination  
there has been much discussion and misunderstanding of
in diesel fuel  algae need light to live and grow  as there is no sunlight in a closed fuel tank  no algae can survive  but some
can survive and feed on the diesel fuel 
these microbes form a colony that lives at the interface of fuel and water  they grow quite fast in warmer temperatures  they can even grow in cold weather when fuel tank heaters are installed  parts of the colony can break off and clog the fuel lines and fuel filters 
water in fuel can damage a fuel   some diesel
also trap water  water contamination in diesel fuel can lead to freezing while in the fuel tank  the freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump  once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze  gelling is more likely to occur  when the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state 
road hazard  
petrodiesel spilled on a roadway poses a hazard to vehicles  due to its high evaporation temperature  after the light fractions have evaporated  a greasy slick is left on the road which can destabilize moving vehicles  causing them to skid  diesel spills severely reduce
grip and traction  and have been implicated in many accidents  the loss of traction is similar to that encountered on   diesel slicks are especially dangerous for two-wheeled vehicles such as
