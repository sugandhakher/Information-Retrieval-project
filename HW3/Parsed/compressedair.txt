compressed air is
kept under a
that is greater than atmospheric pressure  it serves many domestic and industrial purposes 
in europe  10 percent of all industrial electricity consumption is to produce compressed airamounting to 80
consumption per year

air compressor station in a power plant
in industry  compressed air is so widely used that it is often regarded as the fourth utility  after electricity  natural gas and water  however  compressed air is more expensive than the other three utilities when evaluated on a per unit energy delivered basis 
compressed air is used for many purposes  including 
  the use of pressurized gases to do work
  using capsules to move paper and small goods through tubes 
vehicle propulsion  see

the header piping up to the air dryers is exposed to moist  hot air  temperatures can reach well over 150 degrees f   copper  stainless steel and other piping materials that are less corrosive are recommended  if plain carbon steel piping is installed  then rust particles can pass downstream and interfere with the operation of condensate valves and wye strainers  the riser piping should connect to the top of the header piping and be one pipe size larger than the compressor discharge piping and or overhead header piping  a drip leg with a drain is needed to prevent water from flowing back to the compressor  mount valves in the highest horizontal piping  this avoids the hazard of opening a closed valve in vertical piping  and releasing trapped condensate to flow back into air compressors   all of the header main compressed air piping should slope 1/8  to 1/4  per foot down and away from the point of origin  gravity and airflow will then carry condensate to the low points where a drop leg should be installed to allow for removal at accessible drop legs and drain points  these drops should be installed every 50 to 70 feet in the system and be taken from the bottom of the main line to insure as much removal as possible 
the inlet piping for air dryers should connect to the bottom of the piping headers 
compressed air rooms with multiple air compressors  
where multiple air compressors are to connect the riser piping to the top of overhead piping headers  the inlet piping for air dryer s  should connect to the bottom of the piping headers 
compressed air distribution piping outside air compressors rooms  
all of the header main compressed air piping should slope 1/8  per foot down from the point of origin  gravity and airflow will then carry condensate to the low points where drop leg should be installed to allow for removal at to accessible drop legs and drain points  for larger plant  as the piping elevation lowers  a full size tee with a bottom drip leg preceding an elbow turned up to raise the pipe elevation  these drip legs   up turned elbows are typically 200 to 300 feet apart  i e  the main piping slopes about 1/100 feet  and the elbow up raises the piping elevation 2 to 3 feet  compressed air should flow through the straight ends of a tee and should never hit the back side of a tee 
compressed air piping drops  
the air piping drops should connect from the top of the main piping  this prevents any condensate which forms in the main piping from flowing into the branch pipes  individual shut-off valves should be installed  in the horizontal section of the connection piping above the main piping  at each drop pipe to isolate it from the rest of the system for maintenance 
compressed air velocity in piping and fittings  
pressure drop is proportional to the square of the velocity  any high-volume  intermittent demand produces dramatic pressure drop during peak periods
