renewable energy in
represented 0.4  of the national energy balance  excluding biomass  and nearly 10  of electricity production in 2007  renewable energy is supported by strong hydropower sources and the newly installed
parks  147 mw installed and 975 mw under deployment   morocco plans a  13 billion expansion of wind  solar and hydroelectric power generation capacity and associated infrastructure that should see the country get 42  of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020  the moroccan government is keen on increasing renewable energy production  as morocco s januaryseptember oil bill reached about usd 1.4 billion in subsidies in 2009  registering a fall of 57.9  compared to 2008

despite huge wind and solar potential  it is too early to say when morocco could begin exporting renewable electricity to   from projects such as the  400 billion
initiative  it is unclear whether the desertec consortium s planned investment in solar thermal energy across
could go into morocco or how much power could eventually be exported to europe  desertec s plans are likely to need several years more of feasibility studies 
plays a key role in one s  3.4 billion energy development plan  announced in january 2004  the goal is to provide 80 percent of rural areas with electricity by 2008  while increasing the share of renewable energy from 0.24 percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2011  the plan calls for two new wind projects  as well as a 200 - 250-mw thermo-solar facility in dain beni mathar  of which 30 mw will be generated from solar power  one of the wind power facilities  60 mw  will be located in   while the other  140 mw  will be located near   the essaouira facility is scheduled to come on-line in 2007 
morocco has additional renewable resources that could be developed  which the countries four perennial rivers and many dams with hydroelectric potential  in may 2005  one selected temsol for a  27.6 million project to supply solar power to 37,000 rural homes by 2007  similar contracts were awarded in may 2002 to a consortium led by total energie and in january 2004 to apex-bp  currently  only 55 percent of outlying villages have access to electricity 
alstom  a french company building a high speed rail link between tangier and casablanca  will also build power generation facilities with a capacity of 470 megawatts to energize the rail link  while most of the capacity will come from standard gas combined cycle combustion  20 megawatts will be from solar power

in recent years  most efforts have gone into the development of wind energy  which currently accounts for 150 mw of installed capacity and is expected to reach 1554 mw by 2020  the tangier wind farm  which will be morocco s largest  entered construction in 2009 and is expected to go on-line in 2010  the country s wind potential has been estimated at around 6000 mw a year  but its realisation would require billions of euros in investment

on october 1  2014  the world bank approved the financing of a  159 million  usd  solar energy development project  the project is named the  noor-ouarzazate concentrated solar power project   the financing is intended to expand development of a moroccan solar energy complex with the goal of increasing the complex s energy production  as of october 2014  the complex carries a 160 megawatt capacity  project planners hope to grow that capacity to 350 megawatts 
in november 2009 morocco announced it will install 2 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2020  morocco has launched one of the worlds largest solar energy projects costing an estimated  9 billion  the aim of the project is to generate 2,000 megawatts of solar generation capacity by the year 2020  five solar power stations are to be constructed  the moroccan agency for solar energy  masen   a public-private venture  has been established to lead the project  masen has invited expressions of interest in the design  construction  operation  maintenance and financing of the first of the five planned solar power stations  the 500-megawatt plant in the southern town of   the first plant will be commissioned in 2014  and the entire project in 2019  once completed  the solar project will provide 18  of moroccos annual electricity generation 
morocco  the only
country to have a power cable link to europe  aims to benefit from the 400bn   573.8bn  expected to come from the ambitious pan-continental  
national policy

in november 2009 morocco announced a
project worth  9 billion which officials said will account for 38 percent of the north african country s installed power generation by 2020  funding would be from a mix of private and state capital  the ceremony was attended by u s  secretary of state
and the   the project will involve five solar power generation sites across morocco and will produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020  the project would add in terms of power generation the equivalent of the current electricity consumption of the country s commercial capital  
has expressed its willingness to participate in the development of morocco s solar energy project which the country has decided to carry out  as did the  
will also take part in the development of a water-desalination plant 
a net energy importer  morocco launched the national renewable energy and efficiency plan in february 2008 to develop alternative energy to meet 15  of its domestic needs and increase the use of energy-saving methods  the plan is expected to create more than 40,000 jobs and stimulate over 4.5bn in investment by 2020  the national plan for the development of solar thermal energy  formulated in 2001  aims to install 440,000 solar-powered water heaters by 2012  of which 235,000 are completed  the moroccan government plans to produce 40  of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 
in 2008 morocco announced plans for a new campus providing knowledge-based services to strengthen research and training in clean technology  the campus is part of a us 219 million
being built in the eastern city of
to support private sector investment as well as renewable energy companies  building is underway  and the campus is expected to open by 2010 
many initiatives are dedicated to renewable energy such as solar power plants  pumping stations  hydraulic turbines  waste recycling  water pumps  sea water desalination  air conditioning and solar water heaters  re is also the focus of many economic and social programs  as in the case of rural electrification  where individual photovoltaic solar systems account for 7  of energy production 
forecast  
energy sources are significant  forecasts estimate
at 6 gw  the solar heater market at 1m m2  and highlight strong potential for biomass enhancement  9 million hectares of    the expectations in this field are high among institutional stakeholders  economic players and also consumers 
there are four main obstacles to incentives and institutional approaches 
regulations are lacking 
no dedicated agency 
renewable energy and energy efficiency are low priorities for
dedicated to raising awareness and to ensuring sustainable demand in re and energy efficiency technologies and services 
taxation does not provide attractive market conditions
