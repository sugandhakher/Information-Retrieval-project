soon became the new leader of   protests severely disrupted the iranian oil sector  with production being greatly curtailed and exports suspended  in november 1978  a strike by 37,000 workers at iran s nationalized oil refineries initially reduced production from 6 million barrels  950,000m3  per day to about 1.5 million barrels  240,000m3  
 including skilled oil workers  fled the country  on january 16  1979  the shah and his wife left iran at the behest of prime minister
 a longtime opposition leader himself   who sought to calm the situation 
effects  
other opec members  
fluctuations of opec net oil export revenues since 1972
the rise in oil price benefited other opec members  which made record profits  when oil exports were later resumed under the new iranian government  they were inconsistent and at a lower volume  pushing prices up 
and other
nations  under the presidency of   increased production to offset most of the decline  and in early 1979 the overall loss in worldwide production was about 4 percent 
opec failed to hold on to its preeminent position  especially after iran and iraq went to war in 1980 and caused a further 10  drop in worldwide production  and by 1981  opec production was surpassed by other exporters  additionally  its own member nations were divided among themselves  saudi arabia  a    trying to gain back market share after 1985  increased production and caused downward pressure on prices  making high-cost oil production facilities less profitable or even unprofitable

the oil crisis had mixed effects in the united states  due to some parts of the country being oil-producing regions and other parts being oil-consuming regions 
had imposed
on domestic oil  gasoline controls were repealed  but controls on domestic us oil remained 
the
administration began a phased
of oil prices on april 5  1979  when the average
was 15.85 per barrel  42 us gallons  160l    starting with the iranian revolution  the price of crude oil rose to  39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months  its all-time highest
until march 3  2008   deregulating domestic oil price controls allowed u s  oil output to rise sharply from the large
fields  while oil imports fell sharply 
and although not directly related  the near-disaster at
on march 28  1979  also increased anxiety about energy policy and availability 
due to memories of oil shortage in 1973  motorists soon began panic buying  and long lines appeared at gas stations  as they had six years earlier during the  
as the average vehicle of the time consumed between two and three liters  about 0.5-0.8 gallons  of
 petrol  an hour while idling  it was estimated that americans wasted up to 150,000 barrels  24,000m3  of oil per day idling their engines in the lines at  
gas coupon printed but not issued during the 1979 energy crisis
during the period  many people believed the oil companies artificially created oil shortages to drive up prices  rather than factors beyond human control or the us  own price controls  the amount of oil sold in the united states in 1979 was only 3.5 percent less than the record set for oil sold the year previously  a telephone poll of 1,600 american adults conducted by the associated press and nbc news and released in early may 1979 found that only 37  of americans thought the energy shortages were real  9  were not sure  and 54  thought the energy shortages were a hoax 
many politicians proposed gas   one such proponent was     who proposed
 only people with an odd-numbered license plate could purchase gas on an odd-numbered day   as was used during the   several states actually implemented odd-even gas rationing  including           and   coupons for gasoline rationing were printed but were never actually used during the 1979 crisis 
on july 15  1979  president carter outlined his plans to reduce oil imports and improve energy efficiency in his  crisis of confidence  speech  sometimes known as the    speech   it is often said that during the speech  carter wore a
 he actually wore a blue suit 
and encouraged citizens to do what they could to reduce their use of energy  he had already installed solar hot water panels on the roof of the
and a
in the living quarters  however  the panels were removed in 1986  reportedly for roof maintenance  during the administration of his successor   
carter s speech argued the oil crisis was  the moral equivalent of war   critics  then and now  argued that his varied proposals would make the situation worse  not better  several months later  in january 1980  carter issued the   which declared that any interference with u s  oil interests in the
would be considered an attack on the vital interests of the united states  additionally  as part of his administration s efforts at deregulation  carter proposed removing price controls that had been imposed by the administration of
before the 1973 crisis  carter agreed to remove price controls in phases  they were finally dismantled in 1981 under reagan  carter also said he would impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies  while the regulated price of domestic oil was kept to  6 a barrel  the world market price was  30 
in 1980  the u s  government established the
to produce an alternative to imported fossil fuels 
when the price of
crude oil increased 250 percent between 1978 and 1980  the oil-producing areas of texas  oklahoma  louisiana  colorado  wyoming  and alaska began experiencing an economic boom and population inflows

in response to the high oil prices of the 1970s  industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on opec oil  electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal  natural gas  or nuclear power  national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil  and commercial exploration developed major non-opec oilfields in siberia  alaska  north sea  and gulf of mexico  by 1986  daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5million barrels  non-opec production rose by an even-larger amount  and opec s market share sank from 50  in 1979 to just 29  in 1985
