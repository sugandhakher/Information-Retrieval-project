nuclear reprocessing technology was developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel  reprocessing serves multiple purposes  whose relative importance has changed over time  originally  reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing   with the commercialization of   the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into
for   the   which constitutes the bulk of the spent fuel material  can in principle also be re-used as fuel  but that is only economical when uranium prices are high  finally  a
is not restricted to using recycled plutonium and uranium  it can employ all the   closing the
and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from
by about 60 times 
nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste  but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository  reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to   the potential vulnerability to   the political challenges of repository siting  a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel   and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle  in the united states  the obama administration stepped back from president bush s plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research  nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in europe  russia and japan

history  
the first large-scale nuclear reactors were built during   these reactors were designed for the production of plutonium for use in   the only reprocessing required  therefore  was the extraction of the
 free of
contamination  from the spent
fuel  in 1943  several methods were proposed for separating the relatively small quantity of plutonium from the uranium and fission products  the first method selected  a precipitation process called the   was developed and tested at the
 ornl  between 1943 and 1945 to produce quantities of plutonium for evaluation and use in the   ornl produced the first macroscopic quantities  grams  of separated plutonium with these processes 
the bismuth phosphate process was first operated on a large scale at the   in the later part of 1944  it was successful for plutonium separation in the emergency situation existing then  but it had a significant weakness  the inability to recover uranium 
the first successful solvent extraction process for the recovery of pure uranium and plutonium was developed at ornl in 1949  the
process is the current method of extraction  separation plants were also constructed at
and a smaller plant at
which closed by 1972 because of its inability to meet new regulatory requirements 
reprocessing of civilian fuel has long been employed at the
in france  the
site in the united kingdom  the
chemical combine in russia  and at sites such as the tokai plant in japan  the tarapur plant in india  and briefly at the
in the united states 
in october 1976  concern of nuclear weapons proliferation  especially after
demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology  led president
to issue a
to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the u s  on 7 april 1977  president
banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor   the key issue driving this policy was the serious threat of
by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle  and to encourage other nations to follow the usa lead  after that  only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued to reprocess spent nuclear fuel  president reagan lifted the ban in 1981  but did not provide the substantial subsidy that would have been necessary to start up commercial reprocessing 
in march 1999  the
 doe  reversed its policy and signed a contract with a
of     and
 dcs  to design and operate a
fabrication facility  site preparation at the savannah river site  south carolina  began in october 2005  in 2011 the new york times reported     11 years after the government awarded a construction contract  the cost of the project has soared to nearly  5 billion  the vast concrete and steel structure is a half-finished hulk  and the government has yet to find a single customer  despite offers of lucrative subsidies   tva  currently the most likely customer  said in april 2011 that it would delay a decision until it could see how mox fuel performed in the nuclear accident at

purex  
main article 
purex  the current standard method  is an acronym standing for plutonium and uranium recovery by extraction  the purex process is a
method used to reprocess spent   to extract
and   independent of each other  from the
products  this is the most developed and widely used process in the industry at present  when used on fuel from commercial power reactors the plutonium extracted typically contains too much pu-240 to be considered  weapons-grade  plutonium  ideal for use in a nuclear weapon  nevertheless  highly reliable nuclear weapons can be built at all levels of technical sophistication using reactor-grade plutonium  moreover  reactors that are capable of refueling frequently can be used to produce
plutonium  which can later be recovered using purex  because of this  purex chemicals are monitored 
plutonium processing
modifications of purex  
urex  
the purex process can be modified to make a urex  uranium extraction  process which could be used to save space inside high level
disposal sites  such as the   by removing the uranium which makes up the vast majority of the mass and volume of used fuel and recycling it as  
the urex process is a purex process which has been modified to prevent the plutonium from being extracted  this can be done by adding a plutonium
before the first metal extraction step  in the urex process   99.9  of the uranium and  95  of
are separated from each other and the other fission products and   the key is the addition of
 aha  to the extraction and scrub sections of the process  the addition of aha greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and   providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the purex process   
truex  
adding a second extraction agent  octyl phenyl -n  n-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide cmpo  in combination with tributylphosphate   tbp   the purex process can be turned into the truex  transuranic extraction  process  truex was invented in the usa by argonne national laboratory and is designed to remove the transuranic metals  am cm  from waste  the idea is that by lowering the
of the waste  the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease  in common with purex this process operates by a
mechanism 
diamex  
as an alternative to truex  an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised  the diamex  diamideextraction  process has the advantage of avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than       and   such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to
 although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber   the diamex process is being worked on in europe by the french   the process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process  in common with purex this process operates by a solvation mechanism 
sanex  
selective actinide extraction  as part of the management of minor actinides it has been proposed that the
and trivalent minor
should be removed from the purex
by a process such as diamex or truex  in order to allow the actinides such as americium to be either reused in industrial sources or used as fuel  the
must be removed  the lanthanides have large neutron cross sections and hence they would poison a neutron driven nuclear reaction  to date the extraction system for the sanex process has not been defined  but currently several different research groups are working towards a process  for instance the french
is working on a
 btp  based process  other systems such as the dithiophosphinic acids are being worked on by some other workers 
unex  
the universal extraction process was developed in
and the   it is designed to completely remove the most troublesome
 sr  cs and   from the raffinate remaining after the extraction of uranium and plutonium from used   the chemistry is based upon the interaction of
and
with   and a
 known as chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide   the actinides are extracted by cmpo  and the
is a polar
such as   other dilents such as meta-nitrobenzotri and phenyl trifluoromethyl
have been suggested as well 
electrochemical methods  
an exotic method using
and
in
has been reported 
obsolete methods  
bismuth phosphate  
the
is an obsolete process that adds significant unnecessary material to the final radioactive waste  the bismuth phosphate process has been replaced by solvent extraction processes  the bismuth phosphate process was designed to extract
from aluminium-clad   containing uranium  the fuel was decladded by boiling it in   after decladding  the uranium metal was dissolved in  
the plutonium at this point is in the  4 oxidation state  it was then precipitated out of the solution by the addition of
nitrate and
to form the bismuth phosphate  the plutonium was
with this  the
liquid  containing many of the   was separated from the solid  the precipitate was then dissolved in nitric acid before the addition of an
such as
which converted the plutonium to puo22   pu vi   then a
salt was added to maintain the plutonium in the  6 oxidation state 
the bismuth phosphate was next re-precipitated leaving the plutonium in solution  then an iron  ii  salt such as
was added  and the plutonium re-precipitated again using a bismuth phosphate carrier precipitate  then
salts and
were added to create solid lanthanum fluoride which acted as a carrier for the plutonium  this was converted to the oxide by the action of an   the lanthanum plutonium oxide was next collected and extracted with nitric acid to form plutonium nitrate 
hexone or redox  
this is a liquid-liquid extraction process which uses
as the extractant  the extraction is by a solvation mechanism  this process has the disadvantage of requiring the use of a salting-out reagent  aluminium   to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio  d value   also  hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid  this process has been replaced by the purex process 
pu4    4 no3   2s   pu no3 4s2 
butex    -dibutyoxydiethyl ether  
a process based on a solvation extraction process using the triether extractant named above  this process has the disadvantage of requiring the use of a salting-out reagent  aluminium   to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio  this process was used at
many years ago  this process has been replaced by purex 
pyroprocessing  
is a generic term for high-temperature methods  solvents are
 e g  licl kcl or lif caf2  and molten metals  e g  cadmium  bismuth  magnesium  rather than water and organic compounds      and solvent-solvent extraction are common steps 
these processes are not currently in significant use worldwide  but they have been researched and developed at
and elsewhere 
advantages
the principles behind them are well understood  and no significant technical barriers exist to their adoption 
readily applied to high- spent fuel and requires little cooling time  since the
are high already 
does not use solvents containing hydrogen and carbon  which are
creating risk of
and can absorb the
and the
in dilute solutions that cannot be separated later 
alternatively 
can remove 99  of the tritium from used fuel and recover it in the form of a strong solution suitable for use as a supply of tritium 
more compact than aqueous methods  allowing on-site reprocessing at the reactor site  which avoids transportation of spent fuel and its security issues  instead storing a much smaller volume of
on site as
until   for example  the
and
fuel cycles are based on on-site pyroprocessing 
it can separate many or even all
at once and produce highly radioactive fuel which is harder to manipulate for theft or making nuclear weapons   however  the difficulty has been questioned   in contrast the purex process was designed to separate plutonium only for weapons  and it also leaves the
  and   behind  producing waste with more long-lived radioactivity 
most of the radioactivity in roughly 102 to 105 years after the use of the nuclear fuel is produced by the actinides  since there are no fission products with half-lives in this range  these actinides can fuel   so extracting and reusing  fissioning  them reduces the long-term radioactivity of the wastes 
disadvantages
reprocessing as a whole is not currently  2005  in favor  and places that do reprocess already have purex plants constructed  consequently  there is little demand for new pyrometalurgical systems  although there could be if the
programs become reality 
the used salt from pyroprocessing is less suitable for conversion into glass than the waste materials produced by the purex process 
if the goal is to reduce the longevity of spent nuclear fuel in burner reactors  then better recovery rates of the minor actinides need to be achieved 
electrolysis  
pyro-a and -b for ifr  
these processes were developed by
and used in the
project 
pyro-a is a means of separating actinides  elements within the
family  generally heavier than u-235  from non-actinides  the spent fuel is placed in an
which is immersed in a molten salt electrolyte  an electric current is applied  causing the uranium metal  or sometimes oxide  depending on the spent fuel  to plate out on a solid metal cathode while the other actinides  and the rare earths  can be absorbed into a liquid
cathode  many of the fission products  such as  
and   remain in the salt  as alternatives to the molten cadmium electrode it is possible to use a molten
cathode  or a solid aluminium cathode 
as an alternative to electrowinning  the wanted metal can be isolated by using a
of an
metal and a less reactive metal 
since the majority of the long term   and volume  of spent fuel comes from actinides  removing the actinides produces waste that is more compact  and not nearly as dangerous over the long term  the radioactivity of this waste will then drop to the level of various naturally occurring minerals and ores within a few hundred  rather than thousands of  years 
the mixed actinides produced by pyrometallic processing can be used again as nuclear fuel  as they are virtually all either   or   though many of these materials would require a
in order to be burned efficiently  in a
spectrum  the concentrations of several heavy actinides   and   can become quite high  creating fuel that is substantially different from the usual uranium or mixed uranium-plutonium oxides  mox  that most current reactors were designed to use 
another pyrochemical process  the pyro-b process  has been developed for the processing and recycling of fuel from a
  a
designed to convert transuranic nuclear waste into fission products    a typical transmuter fuel is free from uranium and contains recovered
in an inert matrix such as metallic   in the pyro-b processing of such fuel  an
step is used to separate the residual transuranic elements from the fission products and recycle the transuranics to the reactor for fissioning  newly generated technetium and iodine are extracted for incorporation into transmutation targets  and the other fission products are sent to waste 
voloxidation  
voloxidation  for volumetric oxidation  involves heating oxide fuel with oxygen  sometimes with alternating oxidation and reduction  or alternating oxidation by
to
with decomposition by heating back to   a major purpose is to capture
as tritiated water vapor before further processing where it would be difficult to retain the tritium  other volatile elements leave the fuel and must be recovered  especially     and   voloxidation also breaks up the fuel or increases its surface area to enhance penetration of reagents in following reprocessing steps 
volatilization in isolation  
simply heating spent oxide fuel in an inert atmosphere or vacuum at a temperature between 700c and 1000c as a first reprocessing step can remove several volatile elements  including caesium whose isotope
emits about half of the heat produced by the spent fuel over the following 100 years of cooling  however  most of the other half is from
which remains   the estimated overall mass balance for 20,000grams of processed fuel with 2,000grams of cladding is

fluoride volatility  
main article 
blue elements have volatile fluorides or are already volatile  green elements do not but have volatile chlorides  red elements have neither  but the elements themselves or their oxides are volatile at very high temperatures  yields at 100,1,2,3 years after   not considering later   fraction of 100  not 200  
               visible 
in the fluoride volatility process 
is reacted with the fuel  fluorine is so much more reactive than even
that small particles of ground oxide fuel will burst into flame when dropped into a chamber full of fluorine  this is known as flame fluorination  the heat produced helps the reaction proceed  most of the   which makes up the bulk of the fuel  is converted to   the form of uranium used in   which has a very low boiling point    the main   is also efficiently converted to its volatile hexafluoride  a few other elements also form similarly volatile hexafluorides  pentafluorides  or heptafluorides  the volatile fluorides can be separated from excess fluorine by condensation  then separated from each other by
or selective  
and
have very similar boiling points and vapor pressures  which makes complete separation more difficult 
many of the
volatilized are the same ones volatilized in non-fluorinated  higher-temperature volatilization  such as  
and   notable differences are that
is volatilized  but
is not 
some transuranium elements such as  
and
can form volatile fluorides  but these compounds are not stable when the fluorine partial pressure is decreased  most of the plutonium and some of the uranium will initially remain in ash which drops to the bottom of the flame fluorinator  the plutonium-uranium ratio in the ash may even approximate the composition needed for
fuel  further fluorination of the ash can remove all the uranium    and plutonium as volatile fluorides  however  some other
may not form volatile fluorides and instead remain with the alkaline fission products  some
may not form fluorides at all  but remain in metallic form  however
hexafluoride is relatively stable and volatile 
distillation of the residue at higher temperatures can separate lower-boiling
fluorides and
 cs  rb  fluorides from higher-boiling
and
 sr  ba  and
fluorides  the temperatures involved are much higher  but can be lowered somewhat by distilling in a vacuum  if a carrier salt like
or
is being used as a solvent  high-temperature distillation is a way to separate the carrier salt for reuse 
designs carry out fluoride volatility reprocessing continuously or at frequent intervals  the goal is to return
to the molten fuel mixture for eventual fission  while removing
that are   or that can be more securely stored outside the reactor core while awaiting eventual transfer to permanent storage 
chloride volatility and solubility  
many of the elements that form volatile high- fluorides will also form volatile high-valence chlorides  chlorination and distillation is another possible method for separation  the sequence of separation may differ usefully from the sequence for fluorides  for example 
and
have relatively low boiling points of 331c and 114.1c  chlorination has even been proposed as a method for removing zirconium fuel cladding  instead of mechanical decladding 
chlorides are likely to be easier than fluorides to later convert back to other compounds  such as oxides 
chlorides remaining after volatilization may also be separated by solubility in water  chlorides of alkaline elements like        
are more soluble than those of       and  
radioanalytical separations  
in order to determine the distribution of radioactive metals for analytical purposes 
can be used  sirs are porous particles  which contain an extractant inside their pores  this approach avoids the liquid-liquid separation step required in conventional   for the preparation of sirs for radioanalytical separations  organic amberlite xad-4 or xad-7 can be used  possible extractants are e g  trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride cyphos il-101  or n n0-dialkyl-n n0-diphenylpyridine-2,6-dicarboxyamides  r-pda  r   butyl  octy i  decyl  dodecyl  
economics  
the relative economics of reprocessing-waste disposal and interim storage-direct disposal has been the focus of much debate over the past ten years  studies have modeled the total fuel cycle costs of a reprocessing-recycling system based on one-time recycling of plutonium in existing
 as opposed to the proposed
cycle  and compare this to the total costs of an open fuel cycle with direct disposal  the range of results produced by these studies is very wide  but all are agreed that under current  2005  economic conditions the reprocessing-recycle option is the more costly 
if reprocessing is undertaken only to reduce the radioactivity level of spent fuel it should be taken into account that spent nuclear fuel becomes less radioactive over time  after 40years its radioactivity drops by 99.9   though it still takes over a thousand years for the level of radioactivity to approach that of natural uranium  however the level of   including   remains high for over 100,000 years  so if not reused as nuclear fuel  then those elements need secure disposal because of
reasons as well as radiation hazard 
on 25 october 2011 a commission of the japanese atomic energy commission revealed during a meeting calculations about the costs of recycling nuclear fuel for power generation  these costs could be twice the costs of direct geological disposal of spent fuel  the cost of extracting plutonium and handling spent fuel was estimated at 1.98 to 2.14 yen per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated  discarding the spent fuel as waste would cost only 1 to 1.35 yen per kilowatt-hour 
in july 2004 japanese newspapers reported that the japanese government had estimated the costs of disposing radioactive waste  contradicting claims four months earlier that no such estimates had been made  the cost of non-reprocessing options was estimated to be between a quarter and a third   5.57.9 billion  of the cost of reprocessing   24.7 billion   at the end of the year 2011 it became clear that masaya yasui  who had been director of the nuclear power policy planning division in 2004  had instructed his subordinate in april 2004 to conceal the data  the fact that the data were deliberately concealed obliged the ministry to re-investigate the case and to reconsider whether to punish the officials involved
