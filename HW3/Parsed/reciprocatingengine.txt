common features in all types  
there may be one or more pistons  each piston is inside a   into which a gas is introduced  either already under pressure  e g     or heated inside the cylinder either by
of a fuel air mixture    or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder     the hot gases expand  pushing the piston to the bottom of the cylinder  this position is also known as the bottom dead center  bdc   or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder  the piston is returned to the cylinder top     tdc  by a   the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or  in a   by the same process acting on the other side of the piston  this is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder  in most types the expanded or    gases are removed from the cylinder by this   the exception is the   which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas  the stroke is simply the distance between the tdc and the bdc  or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction 
in some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder  in which case it is said to be

in most types  the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a
and a
or by a
or other suitable mechanism  a
is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle  the more cylinders a reciprocating engine has  generally  the more vibration-free  smoothly  it can operate  the power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons  displacement 
a seal must be made between the sliding
and the walls of the
so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine  this seal is usually provided by one or more   these are rings made of a hard metal  and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head  the rings fit tightly in the groove and press against the cylinder wall to form a seal 
it is common to classify such engines by the number and alignment of cylinders and total volume of
of gas by the pistons moving in the cylinders usually measured in cubic centimetres  cm or cc  or
 l  or  l   us  liter   for example  for internal combustion engines  single and two-cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as   while
typically have between four and eight  and   and
may have a dozen cylinders or more  cylinder capacities may range from 10cm or less in model engines up to several thousand cubic centimetres in ships  engines 
the
affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine  it is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder  when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke  and the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke 
the
is the ratio of the diameter of the piston  or  bore   to the length of travel within the cylinder  or  stroke   if this is around 1 the engine is said to be  square   if it is greater than 1  i e  the bore is larger than the stroke  it is  oversquare   if it is less than 1  i e  the stroke is larger than the bore  it is  undersquare  
cylinders may be aligned   in a  
each other  or
around the crankshaft 
put two pistons working at opposite ends of the same cylinder and this has been extended into triangular arrangements such as the   some designs have set the cylinders in motion around the shaft  such as the

in steam engines and internal combustion engines  valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gasses at the correct times in the piston s cycle  these are worked by cams  eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine  early designs used the
but this has been largely superseded by
or
designs  in steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the
and this can often be controlled to adjust the
supplied by the engine and improve efficiency  in some steam engines  the action of the valves can be replaced by an  
internal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder  these operations are repeated cyclically and an engine is said to be  
or
depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle 
in some steam engines  the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam  this is then fed through one or more  increasingly larger bore cylinders successively  to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures  these engines are called  
aside from looking at the power that the engine can produce  the mean effective pressure  mep   can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size  the mean effective pressure is the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle  this is shown by 
wnet   mep x piston area x stroke   mep x displacement volume and therefore  mep   wnet displacement volume
whichever engine with the larger value of mep produces more net work per cycle and performs more efficiently 
history

an early known example of rotary to reciprocating motion can be found in a number of
 dating to the 3rd to 6th century ad  in which a crank and connecting rod mechanism converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel into the linear movement of the saw blades 
the reciprocating engine developed in europe during the 18th century  first as the
then later as the   these were followed by the
and
in the 19th century  today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of    
 lpg  or
 cng  and used to power
and  
one notable reciprocating engine from the wwii era was the 28-cylinder  3,500  2,600kw 
 wasp major  radial engine  it powered the last generation of large piston-engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from 1944 onward  it had a total engine capacity of 71.5l  4,360cuin   and a high power-to-weight ratio 
the largest reciprocating engine in production at present  but not the largest ever built  is the
turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine of 2006 built by   it is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the   it is five stories high  13.5m or 44ft   27m  89ft  long  and weighs over 2,300 metric tons  2,500 short tons  in its largest 14 cylinders version producing more than 84.42mw  114,800bhp   each cylinder has a capacity of 1,820l  64cuft   making a total capacity of 25,480l  900cuft  for the largest versions 
engine capacity  
for piston engines  an engine s capacity is the   in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement  it is generally measured in
 l  or cubic inches  c i d  or cuin or in  for larger engines  and cubic centimetres  abbreviated cc  for smaller engines  all else being equal  engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly  although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement 
other modern non-internal combustion types  
reciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air  steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution-free motive power  most steam-driven applications use   which are more efficient than piston engines 
the french-designed flowair vehicles use compressed air stored in a cylinder to drive a reciprocating engine in a pollution-free urban vehicle 
torpedoes may use a working gas produced by
or   which pressurise without combustion  the 230kg  510lb    for example  can travel 11km  6.8mi  underwater at 74km h  46mph  fuelled by otto fuel without

in a reciprocating quantum heat engine the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or an harmonic oscillator  the

are the ones most studied  the quantum versions obey the laws of   in addition these models can justify the assumptions of   a theoretical study has shown that it is possible and practical to build a reciprocating engine that is composed of a single oscillating atom  this is an area for future research and could have applications in  
miscellaneous engines  
there are a large number of unusual varieties of piston engines that have various claimed advantages  many of which see little if any current use
