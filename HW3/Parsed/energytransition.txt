energy transition is generally defined as a long-term structural change in energy systems  these have occurred in the past  and still occur worldwide  historic energy transitions are most broadly described by   contemporary energy transitions differ in terms of motivation and objectives  drivers and governance  in a more narrow sense  a sustainable energy transition is the shift by some countries  most notably germany    energiewende   to decentralised   and   although so far these shifts have been replacing nuclear energy  their declared goal is also the
and other non-renewable energy sources and the creation of an energy system based on  
renewable energy encompasses    
 thermal and photovoltaic     and   these renewable sources are to serve as an alternative to fossil fuels        and
 uranium   solving the energy problem is regarded as the most important challenge facing humankind in the 21st century 
piecemeal measures often have only limited potential  so a timely implementation for the energy transition requires multiple approaches in parallel 
and improvements in
thus play a major role  an example of an effective energy efficiency measure is improved
for buildings 
can schedule energy consumption for times when electricity is available inexpensively 
after such a transitional period  with a continuing increase in renewable energy production these are expected to make up most  if not all  of the world s energy production in 50 years according to a 2011 projection by the   dramatically reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases

the term  energy transition   
the term  energy transition  designates a significant change in   the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation  for example  producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units   which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency 
in a broader sense the energy transition also entails a democratization of energy  in the traditional energy industry  a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power  renewable energies  in contrast  can as a rule be established in a decentralized manner  public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production  photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals  municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially  while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders  also significant  the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region  renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy  and local governments often promote them  there is lots of room for growth with wind  solar  geothermal  and biomass for power  they represented 2  of global final energy consumption in 2012 
the speed at which a transition in the energy sector needs to take place will be historically rapid  moreover  the underlying technological  political and economic structures will need to change radically  a process one author calls regime shift 
status in specific countries  
austria  
austria embarked on its energy transition  energiewende  some decades ago  due to geographical conditions  energy production in austria relies heavily on renewable energies  notably hydropower  78.4  of domestic production in 2013 came from renewable energy  9.2  from natural gas and 7.2  from petroleum   rest  waste   on the basis of the federal constitutional law for a nuclear-free austria  no nuclear power plants are in operation in austria  but domestic energy production makes up only 36  of austria s total energy consumption  which among other things encompasses transport  electricity production  and heating  in 2013  oil accounts for about 36.2  of total energy consumption  renewable energies 29.8   gas 20.6   and coal 9.7   in the past 20 years  the structure of gross domestic energy consumption has shifted from coal and oil to new renewables  in particular between 2005 and 2013  plus 60    the eu target for austria require a renewables share of 34  by 2020  gross final energy consumption   austria is on a good way to achieve this target  32.5  in 2013   energy transition in austria can be also seen on the local level  in some villages  towns and regions  for example  the town of
in the state of burgenland is a pioneer in independent and sustainable energy production  since 2005  gssing has already produced significantly more heating  58 gigawatt hours  and electricity  14 gwh  from renewable resources than the city itself needs 
united kingdom  
the united kingdom is mainly focusing on   both onshore and offshore  and in particular is strongly promoting the establishment of   with an installed capacity of 2.1 gw  about half of the world s installed offshore wind power   britain is the worldwide leader  at the end of 2012  the country had an 8.4 gw of overall installed wind power capacity  putting it in fourth place worldwide  after china  the united states  and germany  it was initially promoted with a quota system  but expansion targets were missed repeatedly  this led the government to implement a

denmark  
denmark  as a country reliant on imported oil  was impacted particularly hard by the   this roused public discussions on building nuclear power plants to diversify energy supply  a strong
developed  which fiercely criticized nuclear power plans taken up by the government  and this ultimately led to a 1985 resolution not to build any nuclear power plants in denmark  the country instead opted for renewable energy  focusing primarily on   wind turbines for power generation already had a
in denmark  as far back as the late 1800s  as early as 1974 a panel of experts declared  that it should be possible to satisfy 10  of danish electricity demand with wind power  without causing special technical problems for the public grid   denmark undertook the development of large wind power stations  though at first with little success  like with the growian project in germany  
small facilities prevailed instead  often sold to private owners such as farms  government policies promoted their construction  at the same time  positive geographical factors favored their spread  such as good
power density and denmark s decentralized patterns of settlement  a lack of administrative obstacles also played a role  small and robust systems came on line  at first in the power range of only 50-60 kilowatts  using 1940s technology and sometimes hand-crafted by very small businesses  in the late seventies and the eighties a brisk export trade to the united states developed  where wind energy also experienced an early boom  in 1986 denmark already had about 1200 wind power turbines  though they still accounted for just barely 1  of denmark s electricity  this share increased significantly over time  in 2011  renewable energies covered 41  of electricity consumption  and wind power facilities alone accounted for 28   the
aims to increase wind energy s share of power generation to 50  by 2020  while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40   on 22 march 2012  the danish ministry of climate  energy and building published a four-page paper titled  dk energy agreement   outlining long-term principles for danish energy policy 
the installation of oil and gas heating is banned in newly constructed buildings from the start of 2013  beginning in 2016 this will also apply to existing buildings  at the same time an assistance program for heater replacement was launched  denmark s goal is to reduce the use of fossil fuels 33  by 2020  the country is scheduled to attain complete independence from petroleum and natural gas by 2050 
france  
since 2012  political discussions have been developing in france about the energy transition and how the french economy might profit from it 
in september 2012  minister of the environment
coined the term  ecological patriotism   the government began a work plan to consider starting the energy transition in france  this plan should address the following questions by june 2013 
how can france move towards energy efficiency and energy conservation  reflections on altered lifestyles  changes in production  consumption  and transport 
how to achieve the energy mix targeted for 2025  france s climate protection targets call for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40  by 2030  and 60  by 2040 
which renewable energies should france rely on  how should the use of wind and solar energy can be promoted 
what costs and funding models will likely be required for alternative energy consulting and investment support  and how about for research  renovation  and expansion of district heating  biomass  and geothermal energy  one solution could be a continuation of the cspe  a tax that is charged on electricity bills 
the environmental conference on sustainable development on 14 and 15 september 2012 treated the issue of the environmental and energy transition as its main theme 
on 8 july 2013  the national debate leaders submits some proposals to the government  among them  there were environmental taxation  and
development 
in 2015  the national assembly has adopted legislation for the transition to low emission vehicles 
france is second only to denmark as having the worlds lowest carbon emissions in relation to gross domestic product

the policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables  particularly wind power  germanys share of renewables has increased from around 5  in 1999 to 17  in 2010  reaching close to the oecd average of 18  usage of renewables  producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years  guaranteeing a fixed income  energy co-operatives have been created  and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits  the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market  nuclear power plants were closed  and the existing nine plants will close earlier than necessary  in 2022 
the reduction of reliance on nuclear plants has had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels  one factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market  it is believed 8300km of power lines must be built or upgraded 
different
have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines  industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers  who have had rising electricity bills  germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe  nonetheless  for the first time in more than ten years  electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of 2015 
japan  
on 14 september 2012 the japanese government decided at a ministerial meeting in tokyo to phase out nuclear power by the 2030s  or 2040 at the very latest  the government said that it would take  all possible measures  to achieve this goal  a few days later the government retrenched the planned nuclear phaseout after the industry pushed for reconsideration  arguments cited were that a nuclear phaseout would burden the economy  and that imports of oil  coal  and gas would bring high added costs  the government then approved the energy transition  but left open the time-frame for decommissioning the nuclear power plants
