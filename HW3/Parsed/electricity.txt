electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity  though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  even then  practical applications for electricity were few  and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that
were able to put it to industrial and residential use  the rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society  electricity s extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include         and   electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society

the presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force  charges exert a
on each other  an effect that was known  though not understood  in antiquity  457 a lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth  if a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod  it is found to repel the first  the charge acts to force the two balls apart  two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other  however  if one ball is charged by the glass rod  and the other by an amber rod  the two balls are found to attract each other  these phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by   who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms  this discovery led to the well-known axiom  like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract 
the force acts on the charged particles themselves  hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface  the magnitude of the electromagnetic force  whether attractive or repulsive  is given by   which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an
relation to the distance between them  35 the electromagnetic force is very strong  second only in strength to the   but unlike that force it operates over all distances  in comparison with the much weaker   the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the

the charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign  hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive  by convention  the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative  and that by protons positive  a custom that originated with the work of   the amount of charge is usually given the symbol q and expressed in   each electron carries the same charge of approximately 1.60221019  the proton has a charge that is equal and opposite  and thus  1.60221019 coulomb  charge is possessed not just by   but also by   each

electric current
main article 
the movement of electric charge is known as an   the intensity of which is usually measured in   current can consist of any moving charged particles  most commonly these are electrons  but any charge in motion constitutes a current 
by historical convention  a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains  or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part  current defined in this manner is called   the motion of negatively charged electrons around an   one of the most familiar forms of current  is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons  however  depending on the conditions  an electric current can consist of a flow of
in either direction  or even in both directions at once  the positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation 
an
provides an energetic demonstration of electric current
the process by which electric current passes through a material is termed   and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling  examples of electric currents include metallic conduction  where electrons flow through a
such as metal  and   where
 charged   flow through liquids  or through
such as electrical sparks  while the particles themselves can move quite slowly  sometimes with an average
only fractions of a millimetre per second  17 the

current causes several observable effects  which historically were the means of recognising its presence  that water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by

is high enough to produce   which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment 
in engineering or household applications  current is often described as being either
 dc  or
 ac   these terms refer to how the current varies in time  direct current  as produced by example from a
and required by most
devices  is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative  11 if  as is most common  this flow is carried by electrons  they will be travelling in the opposite direction  alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly  almost always this takes the form of a   206207 alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time  the time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero  but it delivers energy in first one direction  and then the reverse  alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under
direct current  such as

the concept of the electric
was introduced by   an electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it  and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field  the electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two   and like it  extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance  however  there is an important difference  gravity always acts in attraction  drawing two masses together  while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion  since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge  the electric field at a distance is usually zero  thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe  despite being much weaker 
field lines emanating from a positive charge above a plane conductor
an electric field generally varies in space  and its strength at any one point is defined as the force  per unit charge  that would be felt by a stationary  negligible charge if placed at that point  469470 the conceptual charge  termed a     must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of   as the electric field is defined in terms of   and force is a   so it follows that an electric field is also a vector  having both
and   specifically  it is a   469470
the study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called   the field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field  this concept was introduced by faraday  whose term    still sometimes sees use  the field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field  they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence  and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines  field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties  first  that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges  second  that they must enter any good conductor at right angles  and third  that they may never cross nor close in on themselves  479
a hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface  the field is therefore zero at all places inside the body  88 this is the operating principal of the   a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects 
the principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of
equipment  there is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium  beyond this point 
occurs and an
causes flashover between the charged parts  air  for example  tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kv per centimetre  over larger gaps  its breakdown strength is weaker  perhaps 1kv per centimetre  the most visible natural occurrence of this is   caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air  and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand  the voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100mv and have discharge energies as great as 250kwh 
the field strength is greatly affected by nearby conducting objects  and it is particularly intense when it is forced to curve around sharply pointed objects  this principle is exploited in the   the sharp spike of which acts to encourage the lightning stroke to develop there  rather than to the building it serves to protect 155
electric potential

and
a pair of   the  sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals 
the concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field  a small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force  and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires   the electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an
slowly to that point  it is usually measured in   and one volt is the potential for which one
of work must be expended to bring a charge of one
from infinity  494498 this definition of potential  while formal  has little practical application  and a more useful concept is that of   and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points  an electric field has the special property that it is   which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant  all paths between two specified points expend the same energy  and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated  494498 the volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term
sees greater everyday usage 
for practical purposes  it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared  while this could be at infinity  a much more useful reference is the
itself  which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere  this reference point naturally takes the name
or   earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge  and is therefore electrically unchargedand unchargeable 
electric potential is a   that is  it has only magnitude and not direction  it may be viewed as analogous to   just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field  so a charge will  fall  across the voltage caused by an electric field  as relief maps show
marking points of equal height  a set of lines marking points of equal potential  known as   may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object  the equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles  they must also lie parallel to a  s surface  otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface 
the electric field was formally defined as the force exerted per unit charge  but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition  the electric field is the local
of the electric potential  usually expressed in voltspermetre  the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential  and where the equipotentials lie closest together  60

magnetic field circles around a current
rsted s discovery in 1821 that a
existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism  moreover  the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces  the two forces of nature then known  the force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire  but acted at right angles to it  rsted s slightly obscure words were that  the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner   the force also depended on the direction of the current  for if the flow was reversed  then the force did too 
rsted did not fully understand his discovery  but he observed the effect was reciprocal  a current exerts a force on a magnet  and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current  the phenomenon was further investigated by   who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other  two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other  while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart  the interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international  
the electric motor exploits an important effect of electromagnetism  a current through a magnetic field experiences a force at right angles to both the field and current
this relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important  for it led to michael faraday s invention of the

consisted of a
sitting in a pool of   a current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury  the magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire  making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained 
experimentation by faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends  further analysis of this process  known as   enabled him to state the principle  now known as   that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of

since electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale  at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required  this requires

applications

electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy  and it has been adapted to a huge  and growing  number of uses  the invention of a practical
in the 1870s led to
becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power  although electrification brought with it its own dangers  replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories  public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting 
the resistive
effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in   while this is versatile and controllable  it can be seen as wasteful  since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station  a number of countries  such as denmark  have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings  electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and   with   representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling  the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate 
electricity is used within   and indeed the   demonstrated commercially in 1837 by

electricity is not a human invention  and may be observed in several forms in nature  a prominent manifestation of which is   many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level  such as  
or   are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale  the
is thought to arise from a
of circulating currents in the planet s core  certain crystals  such as   or even   generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure  this phenomenon is known as   from the
piezein     meaning to press  and was discovered in 1880 by
and   the effect is reciprocal  and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field  a small change in physical dimensions takes place 
some organisms  such as   are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields  an ability known as   while others  termed   are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon  the order   of which the best known example is the   detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called   all animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called   whose functions include communication by the nervous system between
and   an electric shock stimulates this system  and causes muscles to contract  action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants

asked the scientist
why electricity was valuable  faraday answered  one day sir  you may tax it 
in the 19th and early 20th century  electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people  even in the industrialised   the
of the time accordingly often depicts it as a mysterious  quasi-magical force that can slay the living  revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature  this attitude began with the 1771 experiments of
in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of    revitalization  or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after galvani s work  these results were known to
when she authored
 1819   although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster  the revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films 
as the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the
grew  its wielders were more often cast in a positive light  such as the workers who  finger death at their gloves  end as they piece and repiece the living wires  in  s 1907 poem   electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of
and the
books  the masters of electricity  whether fictional or realincluding scientists such as  
or were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers 
with electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century  it required particular attention by popular culture only when it stops flowing  an event that usually signals disaster  the people who keep it flowing  such as the nameless hero of s song     1968   are still often cast as heroic  wizard-like figures
