history  
a 250kw industrial steam turbine from 1910  right  directly linked to a
 left  
the first device that may be classified as a reaction steam turbine was little more than a toy  the classic   described in the 1st century by
mathematician
in   in 1551 
in
described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a   steam turbines were also described by the italian
 1629  and
in england  1648   the devices described by taqi al-din and wilkins are today known as   in 1672 an impulse steam turbine driven car was designed by   a more modern version of this car was produced some time in the late 18th century by an unknown german mechanic 
the modern steam turbine was invented in 1884 by   whose first model was connected to a
that generated 7.5kw  10hp  of electricity  the invention of parsons  steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized marine transport and naval warfare  parsons  design was a
type  his patent was licensed and the turbine scaled-up shortly after by an american    the parsons turbine also turned out to be easy to scale up  parsons had the satisfaction of seeing his invention adopted for all major world power stations  and the size of generators had increased from his first 7.5kw set up to units of 50,000kw capacity  within parson s lifetime  the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times  and the total output from turbo-generators constructed by his firm
and by their licensees  for land purposes alone  had exceeded thirty million horse-power 
a number of other variations of turbines have been developed that work effectively with steam  the de laval turbine  invented by   accelerated the steam to full speed before running it against a turbine blade  de laval s
is simpler  less expensive and does not need to be pressure-proof  it can operate with any pressure of steam  but is considerably less efficient   
developed a pressure compounded impulse turbine using the de laval principle as early as 1896  obtained a us patent in 1903  and applied the turbine to a french torpedo boat in 1904  he taught at the cole des mines de saint-tienne for a decade until 1897  and later founded a successful company that was incorporated into the
firm after his death  one of the founders of the modern theory of steam and gas turbines was   a slovak physicist and engineer and professor at the swiss polytechnical institute  now   in zurich  his work die dampfturbinen und ihre aussichten als wrmekraftmaschinen  english  the steam turbine and its prospective use as a heat engine  was published in berlin in 1903  a further book dampf und gas-turbinen  english  steam and gas turbines  was published in 1922 
the brown-curtis turbine  an
type  which had been originally developed and patented by the u s  company international curtis marine turbine company  was developed in the 1900s in conjunction with   it was used in john brown-engined merchant ships and warships  including liners and royal navy warships 
manufacturing  
the present-day manufacturing industry for steam turbines is dominated by chinese power equipment makers      and   the top three power equipment makers in china  collectively hold a majority stake in the worldwide market share for steam turbines in 2009-10 according to   other manufacturers with minor market share include             and   the consulting firm frost   sullivan projects that manufacturing of steam turbines will become more consolidated by 2020 as chinese power manufacturers win increasing business outside of china 
types  
steam turbines are made in a variety of sizes ranging from small  0.75kw   1hp  units  rare  used as mechanical drives for pumps  compressors and other shaft driven equipment  to 1500000kw  1.5  2000000hp  turbines used to generate electricity  there are several classifications for modern steam turbines 
blade and stage design  
schematic diagram outlining the difference between an impulse and a 50  reaction turbine
turbine blades are of two basic types  blades and   blades move entirely due to the impact of steam on them and their profiles do not converge  this results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades  a turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed nozzles is called an   curtis turbine    or   nozzles appear similar to blades  but their profiles converge near the exit  this results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles  nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit  a turbine composed of moving nozzles alternating with fixed nozzles is called a
or  
except for low-power applications  turbine blades are arranged in multiple stages in series  called   which greatly improves
at low speeds  a reaction stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving nozzles  multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops  resulting in a pressure-compounded turbine  impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded  velocity-compounded  or pressure-velocity compounded  a pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving blades  with multiple stages for compounding  this is also known as a rateau turbine  after its inventor  a velocity-compounded impulse stage  invented by curtis and also called a  curtis wheel   is a row of fixed nozzles followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades  this divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops  a series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a pressure-velocity compounded turbine 
diagram of an aeg marine steam turbine circa 1905
by 1905  when steam turbines were coming into use on fast ships  such as   and in land-based power applications  it had been determined that it was desirable to use one or more curtis wheels at the beginning of a multi-stage turbine  where the steam pressure is highest   followed by reaction stages  this was more efficient with high-pressure steam due to reduced leakage between the turbine rotor and the casing  this is illustrated in the drawing of the german 1905
marine steam turbine  the steam from the
enters from the right at high pressure through a   controlled manually by an operator  in this case a
known as the throttleman   it passes through five curtis wheels and numerous reaction stages  the small blades at the edges of the two large rotors in the middle  before exiting at low pressure  almost certainly to a   the condenser provides a vacuum that maximizes the energy extracted from the steam  and condenses the steam into
to be returned to the boilers  on the left are several additional reaction stages  on two large rotors  that rotate the turbine in reverse for astern operation  with steam admitted by a separate throttle  since ships are rarely operated in reverse  efficiency is not a priority in astern turbines  so only a few stages are used to save cost 
blade design challenges  
a major challenge facing turbine design is reducing the
experienced by the blades  because of the high temperatures and high stresses of operation  steam turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms  as temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency  creep becomes more significant  to limit creep  thermal coatings and
with solid-solution strengthening and
are used in blade designs 
protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit   these coatings are often stabilized -based ceramics  using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy  this reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade  oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades  which is especially important in the high-temperature environment 
the nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance  the
of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition  a uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase  a combination of nickel  aluminum  and titanium  promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure 
elements such as
and
can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength  the addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase  thus preserving the
resistance  strength  and creep resistance 
steam supply and exhaust conditions  
a low-pressure steam turbine in a nuclear power plant  these turbines exhaust steam at a pressure below atmospheric 
these types include condensing  non-condensing  reheat  extraction and induction 
condensing turbines are most commonly found in electrical power plants  these turbines receive steam from a
and exhaust it to a   the exhausted steam is at a pressure well below atmospheric  and is in a partially condensed state  typically of a
near 90  
non-condensing or back pressure turbines are most widely used for process steam applications  the exhaust pressure is controlled by a regulating valve to suit the needs of the process steam pressure  these are commonly found at refineries  district heating units  pulp and paper plants  and
facilities where large amounts of low pressure process steam are needed 
reheat turbines are also used almost exclusively in electrical power plants  in a reheat turbine  steam flow exits from a high pressure section of the turbine and is returned to the boiler where additional superheat is added  the steam then goes back into an intermediate pressure section of the turbine and continues its expansion  using reheat in a cycle increases the work output from the turbine and also the expansion reaches conclusion before the steam condenses  thereby minimizing the erosion of the blades in last rows  in most of the cases  maximum number of reheats employed in a cycle is 2 as the cost of super-heating the steam negates the increase in the work output from turbine 
extracting type turbines are common in all applications  in an extracting type turbine  steam is released from various stages of the turbine  and used for industrial process needs or sent to boiler
to improve overall cycle efficiency  extraction flows may be controlled with a valve  or left uncontrolled 
induction turbines introduce low pressure steam at an intermediate stage to produce additional power 
casing or shaft arrangements  
these arrangements include single casing  tandem compound and cross compound turbines  single casing units are the most basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a generator  tandem compound are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator  a cross compound turbine arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds  a cross compound turbine is typically used for many large applications  a typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below  this shows high- and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear  with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine

two-flow rotors  
a two-flow turbine rotor  the steam enters in the middle of the shaft  and exits at each end  balancing the axial force 
the moving steam imparts both a tangential and axial thrust on the turbine shaft  but the axial thrust in a simple turbine is unopposed  to maintain the correct rotor position and balancing  this force must be counteracted by an opposing force 
can be used for the shaft bearings  the rotor can use dummy pistons  it can be double flow- the steam enters in the middle of the shaft and exits at both ends  or a combination of any of these  in a double flow rotor  the blades in each half face opposite ways  so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together  this design of rotor is also called two-flow  double-axial-flow  or double-exhaust  this arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine 
principle of operation and design  
an ideal steam turbine is considered to be an   or constant entropy process  in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine  no steam turbine is truly isentropic  however  with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 2090  based on the application of the turbine  the interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or buckets  one set of stationary blades is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft  the sets intermesh with certain minimum clearances  with the size and configuration of sets varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage 
theoretical turbine efficiency  
to maximize turbine efficiency the steam is expanded  doing work  in a number of stages  these stages are characterized by how the energy is extracted from them and are known as either impulse or reaction turbines  most steam turbines use a mixture of the reaction and impulse designs  each stage behaves as either one or the other  but the overall turbine uses both  typically  lower pressure sections are reaction type and higher pressure stages are impulse type   
impulse turbines  
a selection of impulse turbine blades
an impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets  these jets contain significant kinetic energy  which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades  as the steam jet changes direction  a pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades  with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage  as the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure  atmospheric pressure  or more usually  the condenser vacuum   due to this high ratio of expansion of steam  the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity  the steam leaving the moving blades has a large portion of the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle  the loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss

states that the sum of the moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the

blades themselves are arranged to form convergent   this type of turbine makes use of the reaction force produced as the steam accelerates through the nozzles formed by the rotor  steam is directed onto the rotor by the fixed vanes of the   it leaves the stator as a jet that fills the entire circumference of the rotor  the steam then changes direction and increases its speed relative to the speed of the blades  a pressure drop occurs across both the stator and the rotor  with steam accelerating through the stator and decelerating through the rotor  with no net change in steam velocity across the stage but with a decrease in both pressure and temperature  reflecting the work performed in the driving of the rotor

practical turbine efficiency  
practical thermal efficiency of a steam turbine varies with turbine size  load condition gap losses and friction losses  they reach top values up to about 50  in a 1200mw turbine smaller ones have a lower efficiency   
operation and maintenance  
a modern steam turbine generator installation
because of the high pressures used in the steam circuits and the materials used  steam turbines and their casings have high   when warming up a steam turbine for use  the main steam stop valves  after the boiler  have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine  also  a
is engaged when there is no steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent   after first rotating the turbine by the turning gear  allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane  no bowing   then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine  first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 1015rpm  0.170.25hz  to slowly warm the turbine  the warm up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours 
during normal operation  rotor imbalance can lead to vibration  which  because of the high rotation velocities  could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing  to reduce this risk  considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine  also  turbines are run with high quality steam  either   or saturated steam with a high dryness fraction  this prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades  moisture carry over   also  liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft  to prevent this  along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high quality steam  condensate drains are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine 
maintenance requirements of modern steam turbines are simple and incur low costs  typically around  0.005 per kwh   their operational life often exceeds 50 years 
speed regulation  
diagram of a steam turbine generator system
the control of a turbine with a
is essential  as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications  such as the generation of alternating current electricity  require precise speed control  uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an overspeed trip  which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close  if these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart  often catastrophically  turbines are expensive to make  requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials 
during normal operation in synchronization with the electricity network  power plants are governed with a five percent   this means the full load speed is 100  and the no-load speed is 105   this is required for the stable operation of the network without hunting and drop-outs of power plants  normally the changes in speed are minor  adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a   generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication 
thermodynamics of steam turbines  
t-s diagram of a superheated
the steam turbine operates on basic principles of
using the part 3-4 of the
shown in the adjoining diagram 
steam  or dry saturated steam  depending on application  leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure  at entry to the turbine  the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle  a fixed nozzle in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine   when the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor  a force is created on the blades due to the pressure of the vapor on the blades causing them to move  a generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft  and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used  the steam leaves the turbine as a
 or liquid-vapor mix depending on application  at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled  the first law enables us to find an formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass  assuming there is no heat transfer to the surrounding environment and that the changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible compared to the change in specific

isentropic efficiency  
to measure how well a turbine is performing we can look at its
efficiency  this compares the actual performance of the turbine with the performance that would be achieved by an ideal  isentropic  turbine  when calculating this efficiency  heat lost to the surroundings is assumed to be zero  the starting pressure and temperature is the same for both the actual and the ideal turbines  but at turbine exit the energy content   specific enthalpy   for the actual turbine is greater than that for the ideal turbine because of irreversibility in the actual turbine  the specific enthalpy is evaluated at the same pressure for the actual and ideal turbines in order to give a good comparison between the two 
the isentropic efficiency is found by dividing the actual work by the ideal work

direct drive  
a direct-drive 5 mw steam turbine fuelled with
use large steam turbines driving
to produce most  about 80   of the world s electricity  the advent of large steam turbines made central-station electricity generation practical  since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky  and operated at slow speeds  most central stations are
and   some installations use
steam  or use
 csp  to create the steam  steam turbines can also be used directly to drive large   such as
at a  
the turbines used for electric power generation are most often directly coupled to their generators  as the generators must rotate at constant synchronous speeds according to the frequency of the electric power system  the most common speeds are 3,000rpm for 50hz systems  and 3,600rpm for 60hz systems  since nuclear reactors have lower temperature limits than fossil-fired plants  with lower steam   the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds  but with four-pole generators  to reduce erosion of turbine blades

parsons turbine from the 1928 polish destroyer  
in   advantages of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size  lower maintenance  lighter weight  and lower vibration  a steam turbine is only efficient when operating in the thousands of rpm  while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 rpm  consequently  precise  thus expensive  reduction gears are usually required  although numerous early ships through   such as   had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts  another alternative is   in which an electrical generator run by the high-speed turbine is used to run one or more slow-speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts  precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime  turbo-electric drive was most used in large us warships designed during world war i and in some fast liners  and was used in some troop transports and mass-production
in  
the higher cost of turbines and the associated gears or generator motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power  although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency  to reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years  today  propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50   yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50   especially in marine applications  diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required  thus  conventional steam power is used in very few new ships  an exception is
which often find it more economical to use
with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it 
use a nuclear reactor to create steam for turbines  nuclear power is often chosen where diesel power would be impractical  as in
applications  or the logistics of refuelling pose significant problems  for example     it has been estimated that the reactor fuel for the  s
is sufficient to last 40 circumnavigations of the globe  potentially sufficient for the vessel s entire service life  nuclear propulsion has only been applied to a very few commercial vessels due to the expense of maintenance and the regulatory controls required on nuclear systems and fuel cycles 
early development  
the development of steam turbine marine propulsion from 1894-1935 was dominated by the need to reconcile the high efficient speed of the turbine with the low efficient speed  less than 300 rpm  of the ship s propeller at an overall cost competitive with   in 1894  efficient reduction
were not available for the high powers required by ships  so
was necessary  in turbinia  which has direct drive to each propeller shaft  the efficient speed of the turbine was reduced after initial trials by directing the steam flow through all three direct drive turbines  one on each shaft  in series  probably totaling around 200 turbine stages operating in series  also  there were three propellers on each shaft for operation at high speeds  the high shaft speeds of the era are represented by one of the first us turbine-powered     launched in 1909  which had direct drive turbines and whose three shafts turned at 724 rpm at 28.35 knots  the use of turbines in several casings exhausting steam to each other in series became standard in most subsequent marine propulsion applications  and is a form of   the first turbine was called the high pressure  hp  turbine  the last turbine was the low pressure  lp  turbine  and any turbine in between was an intermediate pressure  ip  turbine  a much later arrangement than turbinia can be seen on
in   launched in 1934  in which each shaft is powered by four turbines in series connected to the ends of the two input shafts of a single-reduction gearbox  they are the hp  1st ip  2nd ip  and lp turbines 
cruising machinery and gearing  
the quest for economy was even more important when cruising speeds were considered  cruising speed is roughly 50  of a warship s maximum speed and 20-25  of its maximum power level  this would be a speed used on long voyages when fuel economy is desired  although this brought the propeller speeds down to an efficient range  turbine efficiency was greatly reduced  and early turbine ships had poor cruising ranges  a solution that proved useful through most of the steam turbine propulsion era was the cruising turbine  this was an extra turbine to add even more stages  at first attached directly to one or more shafts  exhausting to a stage partway along the hp turbine  and not used at high speeds  as reduction gears became available around 1911  some ships  notably the
  had them on cruising turbines while retaining direct drive main turbines  reduction gears allowed turbines to operate in their efficient range at a much higher speed than the shaft  but were expensive to manufacture 
cruising turbines competed at first with reciprocating engines for fuel economy  an example of the retention of reciprocating engines on fast ships was the famous
of 1911  which along with her sisters
and
had triple-expansion engines on the two outboard shafts  both exhausting to an lp turbine on the center shaft  after adopting turbines with the
launched in 1909  the
reverted to reciprocating machinery on the
of 1912  then went back to turbines on nevada in 1914  the lingering fondness for reciprocating machinery was because the us navy had no plans for capital ships exceeding 21 knots until after world war i  so top speed was less important than economical cruising  the united states had acquired the
and
as territories in 1898  and lacked the british  s worldwide network of   thus  the us navy in 1900-1940 had the greatest need of any nation for fuel economy  especially as the prospect of war with
arose following world war i  this need was compounded by the us not launching any cruisers 1908-1920  so destroyers were required to perform long-range missions usually assigned to cruisers  so  various cruising solutions were fitted on us destroyers launched 1908-1916  these included small reciprocating engines and geared or ungeared cruising turbines on one or two shafts  however  once fully geared turbines proved economical in initial cost and fuel they were rapidly adopted  with cruising turbines also included on most ships  beginning in 1915 all new royal navy destroyers had fully geared turbines  and the united states followed in 1917 
in the   speed was a priority until the
in mid-1916 showed that in the
too much armour had been sacrificed in its pursuit  the british used exclusively turbine-powered warships from 1906  because they recognized that a significant cruising range would be desirable given their worldwide empire  some warships  notably the   were fitted with cruising turbines from 1912 onwards following earlier experimental installations 
in the us navy  the   launched 1935-36  introduced double-reduction gearing  this further increased the turbine speed above the shaft speed  allowing smaller turbines than single-reduction gearing  steam pressures and temperatures were also increasing progressively  from 300 psi 425 f  2.07 mpa 218 c    on the world war i-era
to 615 psi 850 f  4.25 mpa 454 c 
on some world war ii
and later ships  a standard configuration emerged of an axial-flow high pressure turbine  sometimes with a cruising turbine attached  and a double-axial-flow low pressure turbine connected to a double-reduction gearbox  this arrangement continued throughout the steam era in the us navy and was also used in some royal navy designs  machinery of this configuration can be seen on many preserved world war ii-era warships in several countries  when us navy warship construction resumed in the early 1950s  most surface combatants and aircraft carriers used 1,200 psi 950 f  8.28 mpa 510 c  steam  this continued until the end of the us navy steam-powered warship era with the
of the early 1970s  amphibious and auxiliary ships continued to use 600 psi  4.14 mpa  steam post-world war ii  with   launched in 2001  possibly the last non-nuclear steam-powered ship built for the us navy 
turbo-electric drive  
  a nuclear icebreaker with nuclear-turbo-electric propulsion
was introduced on the battleship   launched in 1917  over the next eight years the us navy launched five additional turbo-electric-powered battleships and two aircraft carriers  initially ordered as    ten more turbo-electric capital ships were planned  but cancelled due to the limits imposed by the   although new mexico was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931-33 refit  the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers  this system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts  the system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port  with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more reverse power than with most geared systems  some ocean liners were also built with turbo-electric drive  as were some troop transports and mass-production
in   however  when the us designed the  treaty cruisers   beginning with
launched in 1927  geared turbines were used to conserve weight  and remained in use for all fast steam-powered ships thereafter 
current usage  
since the 1980s  steam turbines have been replaced by
on fast ships and by
on other ships  exceptions are
and   some
continue to use steam propulsion  in the u s  navy  the conventionally powered steam turbine is still in use on all but one of the
amphibious assault ships  the u s  navy also operates steam turbines on their nuclear powered

locomotives  
main article 
a steam turbine locomotive engine is a
driven by a steam turbine 
the main advantages of a steam turbine locomotive are better rotational balance and reduced
on the track  however  a disadvantage is less flexible output power so that turbine locomotives were best suited for long-haul operations at a constant output power 
the first steam turbine rail locomotive was built in 1908 for the officine meccaniche miani silvestri grodona comi  milan  italy  in 1924
built the steam turbine locomotive t18 001  operational in 1929  for  
testing  
british  german  other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test steam turbines  selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer  and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems  in the united states 
has produced several performance test codes on steam turbines  these include asme ptc 6-2004  steam turbines  asme ptc 6.2-2011  steam turbines in   ptc 6s-1988  procedures for routine performance test of steam turbines  these asme performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing steam turbines  the single most important and differentiating characteristic of asme performance test codes  including ptc 6  is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance
