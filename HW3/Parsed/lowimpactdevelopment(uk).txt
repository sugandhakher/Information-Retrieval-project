this article is about the uk meaning of lid  for the canadian us usage  see  
low-impact development  lid  has been defined as  development which through its low negative environmental impact either enhances or does not significantly diminish environmental quality  
the interplay between would-be developers and the uk planning authorities since the 1980s has led to a diversity of unique  locally adapted developments  often making use of natural  local and reclaimed materials in delivering highly affordable  low or   these lids often strive to be
in terms of waste management  energy  water and other needs 
there are numerous examples of lids throughout the uk  and local and national authorities have come to recognise the need for the concept to be incorporated into planning strategies

definition  
low-impact development  lid   in the uk sense of the term  was described by simon fairlie  a former editor of
magazine  in 1996 as   development that through its low impact either enhances or does not significantly diminish environmental quality   fairlie later wrote 
 neither the term nor the concept was new  people have been living low impact lifestyles in low impact buildings for centuries  indeed until very recently the majority of people in the world lived that way  
in 2009 fairlie revised his definition of a lid as   development which  by virtue of its low or benign environmental impact  may be allowed in locations where conventional development is not permitted   he explained 
 i prefer this revised definition because wrapped up in it is the main argument  that low impact buildings need not be bound by the restrictions necessary to protect the countryside from  conventional  high impact development  a k a  suburban sprawl  there are two other principle arguments in favour of lid   i  that some form of exception policy is necessary because conventional housing in a countryside protected from sprawl becomes too expensive for the people who work there  and  ii  soon we will all have to live more sustainable low impact lifestyles  so pioneers should be encouraged  
others have expanded on the definition  a study by the
acknowledged that   lid is usually integrally connected with land management and as much as describing physical development  lid also describes a form of livelihood   however  it also states that as lid is a  multi featured and intrinsically integrated form of development   a simple definition cannot capture the meaning of lid and goes on to develop  a detailed themed definition with detailed criteria  
dr larch maxey in 2013 held the main features of lid to be 
locally adapted  diverse and unique
based on renewable resources
of an appropriate scale
visually unobtrusive
enhances biodiversity
increases public access to open space
generates little traffic
linked to sustainable livelihoods
co-ordinated by a management plan
examples  
england  
whisky barrel house  findhorn
  pembrokeshire
english lid examples include the
    michael buck s cob house in  
   and
   
transition homes  currently under development in
  devon  is an attempt to scale-up and
lid by providing around 25 low cost  low carbon homes designed along
principles  residents will be allocated from the local housing needs register  similarly  lilac built in 2013 a  low impact living affordable community  of 20 homes and a common house in   which was visited by
and   minister of state for housing and local government 
 london  is another example of a larger scale lid  which was built in 20002002 and has 82 homes  however it is not as affordable as many of the above examples as it was partly designed to attract urban professionals 
scotland  
has won a number of international awards  steve james s straw house  dumfries was built for 4,000 
wales  
the   completed in 2000  was originally a showcase of the latest green building technologies  and later transformed into an education centre  in west wales 
 near     is a community of independent  off-grid households begun in 2009  nearby pwll broga roundhouse is a development that was built without planning permission in 2012  refused retrospective planning permission in 2014  but granted permission in july 2015  having met the requirements of the welsh government s one planet development policy 
     was granted planning permission in 2008 with a review in 3 years 
benefits  
substantial research has concluded that lid represents some of the most innovative and
in the uk 
lids have innovated and demonstrated
solutions including    
generation 
and innovative forms of   including  
and  
lid has also shown a capacity to enhance local
and public access to local space  and to produce traffic movements far below the national average  this has been attributed to   to residents  greater use of public transport  walking and cycling and to the integration of local land based employment with other household activities  as the
has noted  such     development therefore is not just describing a physical development  it is describing a way of living differently where there is a symbiotic relationship between people and land  making a reduction in environmental impacts possible  
constraints  
over the years  there have been various struggles with planning authorities over lid in the uk  tony wrench spent over a decade fighting the planning authorities until he was granted planning permission for   as lisa lewinsohn points out in her msc thesis on lid  tony wrench and his partner jane faith have been  enforced against  fined  refused planning permission several times  while
has  probably spent about 50,000 on the application process   similarly  since 1986 tir penrhos isaf has tried several times to get planning permission and only succeeded in december 2006  twenty years after their first planning application was submitted 
the residents of tir penrhos isaf consider 
 that current planning and building legislation represent some of the greatest obstacles to developing sustainable systems in britain  the legislation favours those who already have land and property  actively encourages the squandering of resources and environmental degradation and actively discourages movements towards low impact  sustainable development  
government policy  
the extensive research interest in lid  backed up by the practical examples of the existing lids  has led to a growing number of planning policies in the uk designed to allow for lids  these include the dartmoor national park authority s emerging plan on low impact dwellings in the countryside  the pembrokeshire low impact development policy  policy 52  and the s one planet development policy  opd  which is supported by the independent one planet council  the first development to receive permanent planning permission under the one planet scheme was nant-y-cwm  near   the criteria for opd in wales include the requirement that 65  of all subsistence  or 30  of food and 35  of livelihood  come from the land
