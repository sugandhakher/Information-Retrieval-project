the geysers is the world s largest geothermal field  containing a complex of 22
plants  drawing steam from more than 350 wells  located in the

history  
the geysers resort hotel  ca 1880
for about 12,000 years  native american tribes built steambaths at the geysers and used the steam and hot water for healing purposes and cooking  when euro americans first entered the area  six indian tribes inhabited the area around the geysers  three bands of   two bands of   and the lake   the wappo also collected sulfur which they called te ke and a wappo village  named tekena ntsonoma  teke sulphur   nan well containing water   tso ground   no ma village  was located about 12 miles  19km  southeast of
and on the present-day sulphur creek 
the geysers were first seen by euro americans and named in 1847 during  s survey of the
and the
by william bell elliot who called the area  the geysers   although the geothermal features he discovered were not technically   but   between 1848 and 1854 
developed the geysers into a spa named the geysers resort hotel  which attracted tourists including  
and   the resort declined in popularity in the mid 1880s  and rebranded itself to appeal to lower-income people  in 1938  the main building was destroyed in a landslide although the bar restaurant  small cabins and the swimming pool stayed open  despite another fire in march 1957  until about 1979 
dismantled the remains of the resort in 1980 
five of the geysers facilities were damaged in the
of september 2015  suffering  severe  damage to their cooling towers  the main power houses were not damaged 
geothermal development  
drilling a geothermal well  1977  usgs 
the geysers is the world s largest geothermal field spanning an area of around 30 square miles  78km2  in  
and
counties in california  centered in the area of
and   power from the geysers provides electricity to sonoma  lake  mendocino    and
counties  it is estimated that the development meets 60  of the power demand for the coastal region between the
and the
state line  unlike most geothermal resources  the geysers is a dry steam field which mainly produces
steam 
steam used at the geysers is produced from a
sandstone reservoir  capped by a heterogeneous mix of low permeability rocks and underlaid by a
  gravity and seismic studies suggest that the source of heat for the steam reservoir is a large
chamber over 4 miles  6.4km  beneath the surface  and greater than 8 miles  13km  in diameter 
the first geothermal wells drilled in geyser canyon were the first in the western hemisphere  the first power plant at the geysers was privately developed by the owner of the geysers resort and opened in 1921  producing 250 kilowatts of energy to light the resort  in 1960 
began operation of their 11-megawatt plant at the geysers  the original turbine lasted for more than 30years and produced 11 net power 
by 1999 the steam to power extraction had begun to deplete the geysers steam field and production began to drop  however  since october 16  1997  the geysers steam field has been recharged by injection of treated sewage effluent  producing approximately 77 megawatts of capacity in 2004  the effluent is piped up to 50 miles  80km  from its source at the lake county sanitation waste water treatment plants and added to the geysers steam field via geothermal injection  in 2004  85  of the effluent produced by four waste-water treatment plants serving 10 lake county communities was diverted to the geysers steam field  injecting treated water into the geysers field increases the amount of power that can be generated 
the injection of wastewater to the geysers protects local waterways and
by diverting effluent which used to be put into surface waters  and has produced electricity without releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
seismicity  
according to the
earth sciences division  seismicity was very low prior to the use of the geyser steam field for geothermal energy  although this may have been the result of low seismic coverage of the area  before 1969  there were no earthquakes above
2 recorded by the
 usgs  in an approximately 70 square miles  180km2  area around the geysers  studies have shown that injecting water into the geysers field produces earthquakes from magnitude 0.5 to 3.0  although a 4.6 occurred in 1973 and magnitude four events increased thereafter  even with increasing injection rates over time  the rate of magnitude 3 earthquakes has remained relatively unchanged since the 1980s  although the amount of earthquakes has increased significantly  a magnitude 4.5 earthquake struck near the geysers on january 12  2014  despite the increases in the number of earthquakes and the fears of local residents  it is unlikely that a large earthquake will occur at the geysers since there is no large earthquake fault or fracture nearby 
geochemistry  
in 2005  abatement equipment was installed at two of the geysers plants to reduce the amount of mercury released by the waste vapor even though the amount released was below the legal limit for such releases  the geysers air monitoring programs  gamp  has shown limited releases of arsenic  but again below a significant level 
production  
power plants at the geysers are of the dry steam power plant type  where the steam directly powers the generator  in general  the geysers has 1517
of active installed capacity with an average production factor of 63   955mw  
of nearly two dozen active plants in the geysers in 2013 
operated 19 plants in 2004 but only 15 in 2013  two other plants are owned jointly by the
and the city of  s municipal electric utility  now called    the bottle rock power plant  owned by the u s  renewables group  was reopened in 2007  in july 2009 
planned to drill more than 2 miles  3.2km  down to create an  enhanced geothermal  project which was abandoned when federal agencies asked for review  another plant was under development by ram power corporation  formerly western geopower  in 2010  but after ram power lost both its ceo and cfo in 2013  it was seeking a buyer for its geysers property
