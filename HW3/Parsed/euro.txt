the euro is managed and administered by the -based

characteristics  
coins and banknotes  
main articles 
and
euro coins and banknotes of various denominations 
the euro is divided into 100
 sometimes referred to as euro cents  especially when distinguishing them from other currencies  and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins   in community legislative acts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s  notwithstanding normal english usage  otherwise  normal english plurals are sometimes used  with many
such as centime in france 
all circulating coins have a common side showing the denomination or value  and a map in the background  due to the   the latin alphabet version of euro is used  as opposed to the less common greek or cyrillic  and
 other text is used on national sides in national languages  but other text on the common side is avoided   for the denominations except the 1-  2- and 5-cent coins  the map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced  beginning in 2007 or 2008  depending on the country  the old map is being replaced by a map of europe also showing countries outside the union like norway  the 1-  2- and 5-cent coins  however  keep their old design  showing a geographical map of europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map  all common sides were designed by   the coins also have a national side showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin  euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro 
the new banknotes were introduced in the beginning of 2013  the top half of the image shows the front side of the banknote and the bottom half shows the back side 
from the new europa series written in
 euro  and
 eyp  alphabets  but also in the
   alphabet  as a result of
joining the european union in 2007 
the coins are issued in               and
denominations  to avoid the use of the two smallest coins  some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the netherlands and ireland  by voluntary agreement  and in finland  by law   this practice is discouraged by the commission  as is the practice of certain shops to refuse to accept high value euro notes 
with 2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin  these include both commonly issued coins  such as the 2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the treaty of rome  and nationally issued coins  such as the coin to commemorate the
issued by greece  these coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone  collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well  but these are not intended for general circulation  and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them 
the design for the
has common designs on both sides  the design was created by the austrian designer   notes are issued in               each banknote has its own colour and is dedicated to an artistic period of european architecture  the front of the note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges  symbolising links between countries and with the future  while the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics  the initial designs by
were of specific bridges  including the
and the   and were subsequently rendered more generic  the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes  thus they are not truly generic  the monuments looked similar enough to different national monuments to please everyone 
payments clearing  electronic funds transfer  
main article 
capital within the eu may be transferred in any amount from one country to another  all intra-eu transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs  this includes all member states of the eu  even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro  credit debit card charging and atm withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions  however paper-based payment orders  like cheques  have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based  the ecb has also set up a     for large euro transactions 
currency sign  
the euro sign  logotype and handwritten
main article 
a special
   was designed after a public survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two  the european commission then chose the design created by the belgian alain billiet 
inspiration for the  symbol itself came from the
   a reference to the cradle of european civilisation and the first letter of the word europe  crossed by two parallel lines to  certify  the stability of the euro 

the european commission also specified a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground and background colour tones  while the commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape  font designers made it clear that they intended to design their own variants instead 
lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital  c   backspacing and
it with the equal       sign  placement of the currency sign relative to the numeric amount varies from nation to nation  but for texts in english the symbol  or the -standard  eur   should precede the amount 
there is no official symbol for the cent

the euro was established by the provisions in the 1992   to participate in the currency  member states are meant to meet   such as a budget
of less than three percent of their gdp  a debt ratio of less than sixty percent of gdp  both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction   low inflation  and
rates close to the eu average  in the maastricht treaty  the united kingdom and denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which would result in the introduction of the euro 
economists who helped create or contributed to the euro include        
and      for

the name  euro  was officially adopted in
on 16 december 1995  belgian
  a former teacher of french and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then     suggesting the name  euro  on 4 august 1995 
due to differences in national conventions for
and significant digits  all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of
via the euro  the definitive values of one euro in terms of the
at which the currency entered the euro are shown on the right 
the rates were determined by the   based on a recommendation from the european commission based on the market rates on 31 december 1998  they were set so that one
 ecu  would equal one euro  the european currency unit was an accounting unit used by the eu  based on the currencies of the member states  it was not a currency in its own right  they could not be set earlier  because the ecu depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies  principally the   that day 
the procedure used to fix the conversion rate between the
and the euro was different  since the euro by then was already two years old  while the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced  the conversion rate for the greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand 
the currency was introduced in non-physical form    electronic transfers  banking  etc   at midnight on 1 january 1999  when the national currencies of participating countries  the eurozone  ceased to exist independently  their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other  the euro thus became the successor to the
 ecu   the notes and coins for the old currencies  however  continued to be used as
until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 january 2002 
the changeover period during which the former currencies  notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months  until 28 february 2002  the official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state  the earliest date was in germany  where the
officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 december 2001  though the exchange period lasted for two months more  even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender  they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever  the latter in austria  germany  ireland  estonia and latvia for banknotes and coins  also  belgium  luxembourg  slovenia and slovakia will accept banknotes forever  but not coins   the earliest coins to become non-convertible were the portuguese   which ceased to have monetary value after 31 december 2002  although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022

budget deficit of the euro area compared to the united states and the uk 
following the u s  financial crisis in 2008  fears of a
developed in 2009 among fiscally conservative investors concerning some european states  with the situation becoming particularly tense in   this included eurozone members  
and
and also some eu countries outside the area  iceland  the country which experienced the largest
when its entire international banking system collapsed  has emerged less affected by the sovereign-debt crisis as the government was unable to bail the banks out  in the eu  especially in countries where sovereign debts have increased sharply due to bank bailouts  a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of
and risk insurance on
between these countries and other eu members  most importantly germany  to be included in the eurozone  the countries had to fulfil certain   but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same degree of strictness from country to country 
according to the
in 2011    i f the  euro area  is treated as a single entity  its  economic and fiscal  position looks no worse and in some respects  rather better than that of the us or the uk  and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area s government debt gdp ratio of 86  in 2010 was about the same level as that of the united states   moreover   they write   private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged
economies   the authors conclude that the crisis  is as much political as economic  and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of  institutional
 and mutual bonds of solidarity  of a state  
the crisis continued with s p downgrading nine euro-area countries  including france  then downgrading the entire

in may 2012  socialist
was elected as president of france and a month later the french socialist legislative position was strengthened  while german leader
 has appeared to be floundering and been badly let down by her advisers in recent months   one commentator said  as such   serious discord between french and german monetary decision-makers was  comparable to that of      199293  at the height of the crisis over the   the forerunner to emu        h itherto relatively dormant signs of
in german public opinion and throughout industry have been multiplying in recent months  making hollande s proposals increasingly unpalatable to a broad swathe of german opinion  although considerable controversy will continue to swirl over greece and spain  the real battle lines over the future of the euro will be drawn up between germany and france   the commentary concluded  another historical parallel to 1931 when germany was burdened with debt  unemployment and austerity while france and the united states were relatively strong creditors

warning of its own

the euro is the sole currency of 19   austria  belgium  cyprus  estonia  finland  france  germany  greece  ireland  italy  latvia  lithuania  luxembourg  malta  the netherlands  portugal  slovakia  slovenia  and spain  these countries constitute the     some 332million people in total as of 2013 
with all but two of the remaining eu members obliged to join  together with future members of the eu  the
is set to continue  outside the eu  the euro is also the sole currency of montenegro and kosovo and several
 andorra  monaco  san marino and the vatican city  as well as in four
that are not themselves part of the eu      the

the euro has been used as a trading currency in cuba since 1998  and syria since 2006  there are also various currencies pegged to the euro  see below   in 2009  zimbabwe abandoned its

use as reserve currency  
since its introduction  the euro has been the second most widely held international
after the u s  dollar  the share of the euro as a reserve currency has increased from 18  in 1999 to 27  in 2008  over this period the share of the u s  dollar fell from 71  to 64  and the yen fell from 6.4  to 3.3   the euro inherited and built on the status of the
as the second most important reserve currency  the euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies  according to the
the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to  1.1trillion or 850 billion  with a share of 22  of all currency reserves in advanced economies  but a total of 31  of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies 
the possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists  former
chairman
gave his opinion in september 2007 that it is  absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the us dollar as reserve currency  or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency   in contrast to greenspan s 2007 assessment  the euro s increase in the share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and since the beginning of the worldwide

economics  
optimal currency area  
further information 
in economics  an optimum currency area  or region  oca or ocr   is a geographical region in which it would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency  there are two models  both proposed by   the
and the   mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro  however  even before the creation of the single currency  there were concerns over diverging economies  before the
the chances of a state leaving the euro  or the chances that the whole zone would collapse  were considered extremely slim  however the
led to former
claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form  part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up  john lanchester  writing for   explains it thus 
the guiding principle of the currency  which opened for business in 1999  were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country s annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product  and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of g d p  it was a nice idea  but by 2004 the two biggest economies in the euro zone  germany and france  had broken the rules for three years in a row

the most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency  theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades  for consumers  banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments  e g    
and
withdrawals  
the absence of distinct currencies also theoretically removes
risks  although the imposition of transfer restrictions in
means that the situation is not quite so simple  the risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones  companies that
against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost  this is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal  particularly the mediterranean nations   
financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more
and flexible than they were in the past  the reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone  however  although transaction costs were reduced  some studies have shown that
has increased during the last 40 years in the eurozone 
price parity  
another effect of the common european currency is that differences in pricesin particular in price levelsshould decrease because of the   differences in prices can trigger   i e  
trade in a
across borders purely to exploit the price differential  therefore  prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge  causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition  some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets 
macroeconomic stability  
low levels of inflation are the hallmark of stable and modern economies  because a high level of inflation acts as a tax    and theoretically discourages investment  it is generally viewed as undesirable  in spite of the downside  many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal with serious inflationary pressures  some countries have successfully contained them by establishing largely independent central banks  one such bank was the
in germany  as the european central bank is modelled on the bundesbank  it is independent of the pressures of national governments and has a mandate to keep inflation low  member countries that join the euro hope to enjoy the macroeconomic stability associated with low levels of inflation  the ecb  unlike the
in the united states of america  does not have a second objective to sustain growth and employment 
many national and corporate
denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies  while increased liquidity may lower the
on the bond  denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role  a credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future  allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate 
unfortunately  there is also a cost in structurally keeping inflation lower than in the united states  uk  and china  the result is that seen from those countries  the euro has become expensive  making european products increasingly expensive for its largest importers  hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult  this is one of the main reasons why economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies    this effect is strongest in european countries with a weak economy 
in general  those in europe who own large amounts of euros are served by high stability and low inflation  those who now need to earn euros  including those countries who need to pay interest on large debts  are likely better served with a slightly less strong euro leading to more export  because with a lower euro  investors would see better chances for  companies in  southern european countries to grow themselves out of the crisis  as a result  investing there would become less risky  and that would push interest rates for southern countries more in line with the european average   
the contradiction here is that high macroeconomic stability in the form of ongoing historically low inflation over time leads to economic problems  creating higher interest rates and political and economic instability for the weaker partners   
trade  
a 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5  to 10   although one study suggested an increase of only 3  while another estimated 9 to 14   however  a
of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by
and that the underlying effect may be negligible  furthermore  studies accounting for
reflecting general cohesion policies in europe that started before  and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade  these results suggest that other policies aimed at european integration might be the source of observed increase in trade 
investment  
physical investment seems to have increased by 5  in the eurozone due to the introduction  regarding foreign direct investment  a study found that the intra-eurozone fdi stocks have increased by about 20  during the first four years of the emu  concerning the effect on corporate investment  there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in europe  the euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies  a study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22  of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency 
inflation  
the introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation  in the short term  there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices  but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies  a study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction of the euro on prices  while it had no effect on most goods  it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction of the euro  the study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased  it has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction  retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so 
exchange rate risk  
one of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates  it has been found that the introduction of the euro created  significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside of europe   these reductions in market risk  were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non-euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in europe  
financial integration  
the introduction of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on european financial integration  according to a study on this question  it has  significantly reshaped the european financial system  especially with respect to the securities markets       however  the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant  even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated   specifically  the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds  equity  and banking assets within the eurozone  on a global level  there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios  with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries 
effect on interest rates  
long-term interest rates of euro countries  19932016
as of january 2014  and since the introduction of the euro  interest rates of most members countries  particularly those with a weak currency   have decreased  the countries whose interest rates fell most as a result of the adoption of the euro are greece  ireland  portugal  spain  and italy  these very countries have had the most serious sovereign financing problems 
the effect of declining interest rates  combined with excess liquidity continually provided by the ecb  made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most  and their linked sovereigns  to borrow significant amounts  above the 3  of gdp budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially  and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels  following the   governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them  this further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable  via increasing government bond interest rates  producing the ongoing european sovereign-debt crisis 
price convergence  
the evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed  several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s  other studies have found evidence of price convergence  in particular for cars  a possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear  slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003  and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study  2009  
tourism  
a study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the emu  with an increase of 6.5

the formal titles of the currency are euro for the major unit and cent for the minor  one hundredth  unit and for official use in most eurozone languages  according to the ecb  all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular  this may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages  e g   those where there is no eu   bulgaria has negotiated an exception  euro in the bulgarian cyrillic alphabet is spelled as e  evro  and not e  euro  in all official documents  in the greek script the term   evr  is used  the greek  cent  coins are denominated in    lept    official practice for english-language eu legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural  although the european commission s
states that the plural forms euros and cents should be used in english 
criticism  
unemployment  
nobel memorial prize-winning economist
thought that a central bank should not make price stability the objective of aggregate demand management  when prices are likely to be pushed up due to increase of indirect taxes or adverse terms-of-trade shocks  the surge in prices must be cancelled out by decline in domestic money wage costs  as long as such a price stability policy is adopted  there would be unemployment in the all industrial sectors under a price stabilisation policy  suggesting that in the short run the elasticity of demand for labour is low 
under the ecb s price stabilisation policy  many people in the eurozone have difficulty finding a job  the unemployment rate of spain is around 25 percent in 2014  and an economic forecast says that the figure will not decrease below 20 percent until 2017 
elstat  the statistics agency of greece  shows that greece s unemployment rate was 27 percent in june 2014  oecd forecasts that greece s unemployment rate will remain around 27 percent until 2016  due to long-term unemployment  skills of jobless persons have been depreciated and their motivation of finding jobs has been lost  which causes the country s level of unemployment to remain high

spain s youth unemployment rate is 53.8 percent in july 2014  and this is the highest figure in the eurozone  this figure is comparable to 53.1 percent of the greek youth unemployment in may 2014 
in july 2014  the averaged unemployment rate of the eurozone is 11.7 percent  slight decrease from 11.9 percent in 2013 
likewise 
argued that the existence of a single shared currency across the entire eurozone  in combination with tight money policies of the ecb  motivated by insistence of germany on low inflation   placed much of southern europe in a state of permanent high unemployment  according to krugman  during the period between the creation of the euro and the 2008 financial crisis  countries of southern europe experienced abnormally high rates of wage growth due to high influx of investor money  between 2000 and 2008  unit labor costs actually declined slightly in germany  but rose by 30  in spain and greece  this created an imbalance that put these countries at competitive disadvantage relative to northern europe  returning to full employment at this point requires that the labor costs gap is somehow cancelled  if spain and greece had their own currencies  this would have easily happened through exchange rate adjustment  since they don t  it can either happen through a decrease in nominal wages in spain and greece  also known as  internal devaluation    an extremely difficult and slow process  since nominal wages  in general  exhibit    or through an equal increase in nominal wages  i e  inflation  in northern europe  which does not happen because of active resistance from germany
