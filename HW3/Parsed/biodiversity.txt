the number and variety of plants  animals and other organisms that exist is known as biodiversity  it is an essential component of nature and it ensures the survival of human species by providing food  fuel  shelter  medicines and other resources to mankind  the richness of biodiversity depends on the climatic conditions and area of the region  all species of plants taken together are known as flora and about 70,000 species of plants are known to date  all species of animals taken together are known as fauna which includes birds  mammals  fish  reptiles  insects  crustaceans  molluscs  etc

etymology  
the term biological diversity was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist raymond f  dasmann in the year 1968 lay book a different kind of country advocating conservation  the term was widely adopted only after more than a decade  when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy    in the foreword to the book conservation biology  introduced the term to the scientific community  until then the term  natural diversity  was common  introduced by the science division of
in an important 1975 study   the preservation of natural diversity   by the early 1980s tnc s science program and its head  robert e  jenkins  lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in america advocated the use of the term  biological diversity  
the term s contracted form biodiversity may have been coined by w g  rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 national forum on biological diversity organized by the
 nrc   it first appeared in a publication in 1988 when
used it as the title of the
of that forum 
since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists  environmentalists  political leaders and concerned citizens 
a similar term in the united states is  natural heritage   it pre-dates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation  broader than biodiversity  it includes geology and landforms   
definitions  
a sampling of
collected during summer 2008 in northern
mixed woods  near laronge is an example regarding the species diversity of fungi  in this photo  there are also leaf
and  
 biodiversity  is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms 
and   biologists most often define biodiversity as the  totality of genes  species and ecosystems of a region   an advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified 
taxonomic diversity  usually measured at the
level 
ecological diversity often viewed from the perspective of
morphological diversity which stems from
functional diversity which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population  e g  different feeding mechanism  different motility  predator vs prey  etc  
in 2003 professor anthony campbell at  
and the darwin centre    defined a fourth level  molecular diversity 
this multilevel construct is consistent with datman and lovejoy  an explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by bruce a  wilcox commissioned by the
 iucn  for the 1982 world national parks conference  wilcox s definition was  biological diversity is the variety of life forms   at all levels of biological systems  i e   molecular  organismic  population  species and ecosystem       the 1992
defined  biological diversity  as  the variability among living organisms from all sources  including   inter alia    
and other
and the ecological complexes of which they are part  this includes diversity within species  between species and of ecosystems   this definition is used in the united nations  
one textbook s definition is  variation of life at all levels of biological organization  
genetically biodiversity can be defined as the diversity of alleles  genes and   they study processes such as
and
that drive evolution 
measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels  however 
 terrestrial   taxonomic and ecological diversity shows a very close correlation 
distribution  
a
in the
  
biodiversity is not evenly distributed  rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions  among other factors  the diversity of all living things    depends on temperature  precipitation  altitude    geography and the presence of other species  the study of the spatial distribution of   species and   is the science of  
diversity consistently measures higher in the
and in other localized regions such as the
and lower in polar regions generally 
that have had wet climates for a long time  such as
in   have particularly high biodiversity 
terrestrial biodiversity is thought to be up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity  a recently discovered method put the total number of species on earth at 8.7 million  of which 2.1 million were estimated to live in the ocean  however  this estimate seems to under-represent the diversity of microorganisms 
latitudinal gradients  
main article 
generally  there is an increase in biodiversity from the
to the   thus localities at lower
have more species than localities at higher latitudes  this is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity  several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient  but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles 
even though terrestrial biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles  some studies claim that this characteristic is unverified in   especially in   the latitudinal distribution of parasites does not appear to follow this rule 
hotspots  
a
is a region with a high level of
species that has experienced great   the term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by   while hotspots are spread all over the world  the majority are forest areas and most are located in the  
 s
is considered one such hotspot  containing roughly 20,000 plant species  1,350 vertebrates and millions of insects  about half of which occur nowhere else    the island of
and india are also particularly notable 
is characterized by high biodiversity  with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it has the largest number of endemics  species that are not found naturally anywhere else  of any country  about 10  of the species of the earth can be found in colombia  including over 1,900 species of bird  more than in europe and north america combined  colombia has 10  of the world s mammals species  14  of the amphibian species and 18  of the bird species of the world 
and lowland rainforests possess a high ratio of     since the island separated from mainland
66 million years ago  many species and ecosystems have evolved independently     s 17,000 islands cover 735,355 square miles  1,904,560km2  and contain 10  of the world s flowering plants  12  of mammals and 17  of  
and along with nearly 240 million people  many regions of high biodiversity and or endemism arise from specialized
which require unusual adaptations  for example 
environments in high   or

biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of   the
has not been definitely established by science  however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the   until approximately 600 million years ago  all life consisted of    
and similar  
the history of biodiversity during the
 the last 540 million years   starts with rapid growth during the a period during which nearly every
of
first appeared  over the next 400 million years or so  invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend  this dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic  massive losses of diversity classified as
events  a significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous  the worst was the   251 million years ago  vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event 
the
suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in   however  not all scientists support this view  since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent
sections  some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts  modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago   whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life  estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million  with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million  the vast majority   diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection 
evolutionary diversification  
the existence of a  global carrying capacity   limiting the amount of life that can live at once  is debated  as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species  while records of life in the sea shows a
pattern of growth  life on land  insects  plants and tetrapods shows an
rise in diversity  as one author states   tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and
diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled  
on the other hand  changes through the
correlate much better with the
model  widely used in  
and   as well as
biodiversity  than with exponential and logistic models  the latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order
 more ancestors  more descendants  and or a
arising from resource limitation  hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback  the hyperbolic pattern of the
growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth  the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity  the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and
dynamics 
most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction  named the   caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment  it has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet earth within 100 years 
new species are regularly discovered  on average between 510,000 new species each year  most of them   and many  though discovered  are not yet classified  estimates are that nearly 90  of all
are not yet classified   most of the terrestrial diversity is found in
and in general  land has more species than the ocean  some 8.7 million species may exists on earth  of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean
biodiversity and ecosystem services

the balance of evidence  
 ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity  
these services come in three flavors 
provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources  e g   food  wood  fresh water 
regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change  e g   climate regulation  pest disease control 
cultural services represent human value and enjoyment  e g   landscape aesthetics  cultural heritage  outdoor recreation and spiritual significance 
there have been many claims about biodiversity s effect on these ecosystem services  especially provisioning and regulating services  after an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity s effect on ecosystem services  14 of those claims have been validated  6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported  3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions

other sources have reported somewhat conflicting results and in 1997 robert costanza and colleagues reported the estimated global value of ecosystem services  not captured in traditional markets  at an average of  33 trillion annually 
since the   species loss has accelerated above the average basal rate  driven by human activity  estimates of species losses are at a rate 100-10,000 times as fast as is typical in the fossil record  biodiversity also affords many non-material benefits including spiritual and aesthetic values  knowledge systems and education 
biodiversity and agriculture

agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories    which includes the genetic variety within a single species  like the potato    that is composed of many different forms and types  e g   in the u s  we might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes  all different  but all part of the same species  s  tuberosum  
the other category of agricultural diversity is called
and refers to the number and types of different species  thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots  peppers  lettuce etc 
agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is planned diversity or associated diversity  this is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity  planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged  planted or raised  e g   crops  covers  symbionts and livestock  among others   which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops  uninvited  e g   herbivores  weed species and pathogens  among others  
the control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face  on
farms  the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive   mechanized tools and   then to   although some
farmers use the same techniques  they also employ
strategies as well as strategies that are more labor-intensive  but generally less dependent on capital  biotechnology and energy 
interspecific crop diversity is  in part  responsible for offering variety in what we eat  intraspecific diversity  the variety of alleles within a single species  also offers us choice in our diets  if a crop fails in a monoculture  we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new  if a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year  relying on intraspecific diversity  we may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether  relying on interspecific diversity  even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures  relies on biodiversity at some point 
the
of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of about two million  it was the result of planting only two potato varieties  both vulnerable to the blight    which arrived in 1845
when
struck rice fields from indonesia to india in the 1970s  6,273 varieties were tested for resistance  only one was resistant  an indian variety and known to science only since 1966  this variety formed a hybrid with other varieties and is now widely grown 
attacked coffee plantations in  
and central america in 1970  a resistant variety was found in ethiopia  the diseases are themselves a form of biodiversity 
was a contributing factor to several agricultural disasters  including the european wine industry collapse in the late 19th century and the us
epidemic of 1970 
although about 80 percent of humans  food supply comes from just 20 kinds of plants    humans use at least 40,000 species    many people depend on these species for food  shelter and clothing    earth s surviving biodiversity provides resources for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use  although the present extinction rate shrinks that potential 
biodiversity and human health  
the diverse forest canopy on   panama  yielded this display of different fruit
biodiversity s relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue  as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss 
this issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change  as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity  e g  changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors  scarcity of fresh water  impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc   this is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission  while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission  such as that of west nile virus  lyme disease and hantavirus  according to a study done co-authored by felicia keesing  an ecologist at bard college and drew harvell  associate director for environment of the
 acsf  at  
the growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health  partly  the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources  while the distribution of clean water increases  in some parts of the world it remains unequal  according to 2008 world population data sheet  only 62  of least developed countries are able to access clean water 
some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security  infectious disease  medical science and medicinal resources  social and psychological health  biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts 
biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources  a significant proportion of drugs are derived  directly or indirectly  from biological sources  at least 50  of the pharmaceutical compounds on the us market are derived from plants  animals and   while about 80  of the world population depends on medicines from nature  used in either modern or traditional medical practice  for primary healthcare  only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential  biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of   evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the mid-1980s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration   bioprospecting   in favor of genomics and synthetic chemistry  indeed claims about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high cost of development  meanwhile  natural products have a long history of supporting significant economic and health innovation  marine ecosystems are particularly important  although inappropriate
can increase biodiversity loss  as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken 
biodiversity  business and industry  
production  pictured is a
and a
many industrial materials derive directly from biological sources  these include building materials  fibers  dyes  rubber and oil  biodiversity is also important to the security of resources such as water  timber  paper  fiber and food  as a result  biodiversity loss is a significant risk factor in business development and a threat to long term economic sustainability 
biodiversity  leisure  cultural and aesthetic value  
biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as  
or natural history study  biodiversity inspires   painters  sculptors  writers and other artists  many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms 
popular activities such as  
and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity  the number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands  though the majority do not enter commerce 
the relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors  suppliers  breeders  propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood  the general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms  reflecting their inherent value 
philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to
in and of itself  this idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that
and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide

biodiversity supports many  
 there is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources  produce biomass  decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients    there is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time    diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture    the impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change    maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time

main article 
discovered and predicted total number of species on land and in the oceans
according to mora and colleagues  the total number of terrestrial species is estimated to be around 8.7 million while the number of oceanic species is much lower  estimated at 2.2 million  the authors note that these estimates are strongest for eukaryotic organisms and likely represent the lower bound of prokaryote diversity  other estimates include 
220,000   estimated using the species-area relation method

during the last century  decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly observed  in 2007  german federal environment minister sigmar gabriel cited estimates that up to 30  of all species will be extinct by 2050  of these  about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with   estimates reach as high as 140,000 species per year  based on    this figure indicates
ecological practices  because few species emerge each year    almost all scientists acknowledge that the rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history  with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than
rates  as of 2012  some studies suggest that 25  of all mammal species could be extinct in 20 years 
in absolute terms  the planet has lost 52  of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2014 study by the   the living planet report 2014 claims that  the number of mammals  birds  reptiles  amphibians and fish across the globe is  on average  about half the size it was 40 years ago   of that number  39  accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone  39  for the marine wildlife gone and 76  for the freshwater wildlife gone  biodiversity took the biggest hit in   plummeting 83 percent  high-income countries showed a 10  increase in biodiversity  which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries  this is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries  which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations  which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses

is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained  without barriers  such species occupy new territory  often supplanting native species by occupying their niches  or by using resources that would normally sustain native species 
the number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s  species are increasingly being moved by humans  on purpose and accidentally   in some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats  e g   zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the great lakes region and the lion fish along the north american atlantic coast   some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance  others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals  an important question is   do invasive species cause extinctions   many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives  but not extinctions  invasive species seem to increase local  i e     diversity  which decreases turnover of diversity  i e      overall

at present  several countries have already imported so many exotic species  particularly agricultural and ornamental plants  that their own indigenous fauna flora may be outnumbered  for example  the introduction of

genetic pollution

as a result of either a numerical and or
advantage of an introduced species  hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion  these phenomena can be especially detrimental to
that come into contact with more abundant ones  the abundant species can interbreed with the rare species  swamping its   this problem is not always apparent from
 outward appearance  observations alone  some degree of
is normal adaptation and not all
and
constellations can be preserved  however  hybridization with or without introgression may  nevertheless  threaten a rare species  existence

have genetic material altered by
procedures such as   gm crops have become a common source for genetic pollution  not only of wild varieties but also of domesticated varieties derived from classical hybridization 
genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution may be destroying unique genotypes  thereby creating a hidden crisis which could result in a severe threat to our   diverse genetic material could cease to exist which would impact our ability to further hybridize food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes 
climate change  
main article 
on the sea ice of the   near the   climate change has started affecting bear populations 
global warming is also considered to be a major potential threat to global biodiversity in the future  for example  coral reefs - which are biodiversity hotspots - will be lost within the century if global warming continues at the current trend 
climate change has seen many claims about potential to affect biodiversity but evidence supporting the statement is tenuous  increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide certainly affects plant morphology and is acidifying oceans  and temperature affects species ranges  phenology  and weather  but the major impacts that have been predicted are still just potential impacts  we have not documented major extinctions yet  even as climate change drastically alters the biology of many species 
in 2004  an international collaborative study on four continents estimated that 10 percent of species would become extinct by 2050 because of global warming   we need to limit climate change or we wind up with a lot of species in trouble  possibly extinct   said dr  lee hannah  a co-author of the paper and chief climate change biologist at the center for applied biodiversity science at conservation international 
a recent study predicts that up to 35  of the world terrestrial carnivores and ungulates will be at higher risk of extinction by 2050 because of the joint effects of predicted climate and land-use change under business-as-usual human development scenarios 
human overpopulation  
main article 
from 1950 to 2011  world population increased from 2.5 billion to 7 billion and is forecast to reach a plateau of more than 9 billion during the 21st century  sir   former chief scientific adviser to the uk government  told a parliamentary inquiry   it is self-evident that the massive growth in the
through the 20th century has had more impact on biodiversity than any other single factor   at least until the middle of the 21st century  worldwide losses of pristine biodiverse land will probably depend much on the worldwide

protected areas is meant for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves  protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals 
national parks  
main article 
national park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation  national parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments  a limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas  designated trails or roads are created  the visitors are allowed to enter only for study  cultural and recreation purposes  forestry operations  grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated  exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned 
wildlife sanctuary  
wildlife sanctuary aims only at conservation of species and have the following features 
the boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation 
the killing  hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is responsible for the management of the sanctuary 
private ownership may be allowed 
forestry and other usages can also be permitted 
forest reserves  
the forests play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic  plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species  in reserved forests  rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest  who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products  the unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics 
they are large inaccessible forests 
many of these are unoccupied 
they are ecologically and economically less important 
steps to conserve the forest cover  
an extensive reforestation afforestation program should be followed 
alternative environment-friendly sources of fuel energy such as biogas other than wood should be used 
loss of biodiversity due to forest fire is a major problem  immediate steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken 
overgrazing by cattle can damage a forest seriously  therefore  certain steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle 
hunting and poaching should be banned 
zoological parks  
in zoological parks or zoos  live animals are kept for public recreation  education and conservation purposes  modern zoos offer veterinary facilities  provide opportunities for threatened species to breed in captivity and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care  zoos play a major role in creating awareness among common people about the need to conserve nature 
botanical gardens  
botanical garden is a garden in which plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes  it consists of a collection of living plants  grown outdoors or under glass in greenhouses and conservatories  in addition  it includes a collection of dried plants or herbarium and such facilities as lecture rooms  laboratories  libraries  museums and experimental or research plantings 
resource allocation  
focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity 
a second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity  which typically require little or no restoration  these are typically non-urbanized  non-agricultural areas  tropical areas often fit both criteria  given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development

 indirectly by protecting biodiversity habitats 
regional conventions such as the apia convention
bilateral agreements such as the  
global agreements such as the   give  sovereign national rights over biological resources   not property   the agreements commit countries to  conserve biodiversity    develop resources for sustainability  and  share the benefits  resulting from their use  biodiverse countries that allow
or collection of natural products  expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers exploits the resource to capture them privately  bioprospecting can become a type of
when such principles are not respected   
sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as
 abas   the convention on biodiversity implies
between the source country and the collector  to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a  
national level laws  
biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions 
the relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity  it is related to private and public property rights  it can define protection for threatened ecosystems  but also some rights and duties  for example 
and hunting rights    
law regarding species is more recent  it defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction  the u s 
is an example of an attempt to address the  law and species  issue 
laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old    domestication and plant breeding methods are not new  but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of   gene
and process patents  governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example  genes  genomes  or organisms and species   
uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved  however  bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard  claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals 
india passed the
in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in india  the act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge 
analytical limits  
taxonomic and size relationships  
less than 1  of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence  the vast majority of earth s species are microbial  contemporary biodiversity physics is  firmly fixated on the visible  macroscopic  world   for example  microbial life is
and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life  see e g       on the tree of life  based on analyses of small-subunit   visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs  the inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder to a first approximation  all multicellular species on earth are insects   insect extinction rates are highsupporting the holocene extinction hypothesis
