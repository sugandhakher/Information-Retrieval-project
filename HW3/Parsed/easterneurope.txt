the earliest known distinctions between east and west in europe originate in the history of the   as the roman domain expanded  a cultural and linguistic division appeared between the mainly -speaking eastern provinces which had formed the highly urbanized   in contrast the western territories largely adopted the   this cultural and linguistic division was eventually reinforced by the later political eastwest division of the   the division between these two spheres was enhanced during

alphabet use is not a strict determinant for eastern europe  where from croatia to poland and everywhere in between  the latin alphabet is used  greece s status as the cradle of western civilization and an integral part of the western world in the political  cultural and economic spheres has led to it being nearly always classified as belonging not to eastern  but to southern and or western europe  during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries eastern europe enjoyed a relative high standard of living  this period is also called the east-central european golden age of around 1600

by the soviet union   czechoslovakia  and yugoslavia  austria and hungary had much reduced boundaries  romania  bulgaria and albania likewise were independent  all the countries were heavily rural  with little industry and only a few urban centers  nationalism was the dominant force but most of the countries had ethnic or religious minorities who felt threatened by majority elements  nearly all became democratic in the 1920s  but all of them  except czechoslovakia and finland  gave up democracy during the depression years of the 1930s  in favor of autocratic or strong-man or single party states  the new states were unable to form stable military alliances  and one by one were too weak to stand up against nazi germany or the soviet union  which took them over between 1938 and 1945
