cleantech
and   photovoltaic ombrire sudi is an autonomous and mobile station that replenishes energy for electric vehicles using  
environmental technology  envirotech   green technology  greentech  or clean technology  cleantech  is the application of one or more of    
and electronic devices to monitor  model and conserve the
and resources  and to curb the negative impacts of human involvement  the term is also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as       etc 
is the core of environmental technologies  the term environmental technologies is also used to describe a class of electronic devices that can promote sustainable management of resources

renewable energy  
a view across a
plant in  
is the
that can be replenished easily  for years we have been using sources like   sun    etc  for means for producing energy  energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood  sun  wind  etc  is considered to be renewable 
water purification  
  the whole idea concept of having dirt germ pollution free water flowing throughout the environment  many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water  water pollution is the main enemy of this concept  and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water 
air purification  
air purification  basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove co2 and convert it into   the best examples are      and  
sewage treatment  
is conceptually similar to water purification  sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution  the most polluted water is not used for anything  and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently  it may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection  sustainability etc 
environmental remediation  
is the removal of pollutants or contaminants for the general protection of the environment  this is accomplished by various chemical  biological  and bulk movements   encyclopedia of medical concepts 
solid waste management  
net zero court zero emissions office building prototype in
is the purification  consumption  reuse  disposal and treatment of
that is undertaken by the government or the ruling bodies of a city town 
egain forecasting  
egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future  s impact on a building  by adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast  the system eliminates redundant use of heat  thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of  
energy conservation  
is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity  reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity 
alternative and clean power  
the
was the first all-electric sports car for sale and in serial production  it can be plugged into conventional outlets and can be charged fully or partially on   including    
or  
principles 
scientists continue to search for
alternatives to our current power production methods  some technologies such as
produce renewable energy from
materials  the global reduction of
is dependent on the adoption of energy conservation technologies at industrial level as well as this clean energy generation  that includes using unleaded  
and
vehicles  including
and
vehicles 
since industrial use of energy accounts for 51  of worldwide energy usage improving energy efficiency in this field is a top priority for environmental technology companies around the globe  advanced energy efficient
 and   technology that are cost effective to encourage their application  such as the
and   can reduce the amount of
 co2  and
 so2  that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere  if electricity is generated using fossil fuels 
is an event held yearly in  
which is one of the largest showcases of environmental technology in the  
there are more chemical formula like this  for example reaction on water in nitric acid
there are things made on heat process like iron  steel  zinc etc   it also may be reversed making things on freezing or cooling process  like cement and water reaction make strong chemical molecules  or glue or super glue on heat they do not melt  but iron  steel and zinc melt on heat  so super glue like chemical formula with more chemical work will be so strong if it will be processed from high cool temperature  minus temperature 
education  
courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes 
courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment 
  sustainable chemistry or environmental chemical engineering courses oriented towards understanding the effects  good and bad  of chemicals in the environment  such awards can focus on mining processes  pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes 
environmental technology courses oriented towards producing electronic  electrical or electrotechnology graduates capable of developing devices and artefacts able to monitor  measure  model and control environmental impact  including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources  and developing novel energy generation technologies
