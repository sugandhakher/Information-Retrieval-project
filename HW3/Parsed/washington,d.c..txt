washington  d c   is a   in 1791  president washington commissioned   a french-born architect and city planner  to design the new capital  the
featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles  providing room for open space and landscaping  he based his design on plans of cities such as       and
that
had sent to him  l enfant s design also envisioned a garden-lined  grand avenue  approximately 1 mile  1.6km  in length and 400 feet  120m  wide in the area that is now the national mall 
for washington  d c   as revised by
in 1792
president washington dismissed l enfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital s construction    who had worked with l enfant surveying the city  was then tasked with completing the design  though ellicott made revisions to the original plans  including changes to some street patterns  l enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city 
by the early 1900s  l enfant s vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings  including a railroad station on the national mall  congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washington s ceremonial core  what became known as the
was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall  clearing slums  and establishing a new citywide park system  the plan is thought to have largely preserved l enfant s intended design

the district is divided into
of unequal area        and   the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the u s  capitol building  all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol  most streets are set out in a grid pattern with eastwest streets named with letters  e g   c street sw   northsouth streets with numbers  e g   4th street nw   and diagonal avenues  many of which are

style such as the  
outside downtown washington  architectural styles are even more varied  historic buildings are designed primarily in the       georgian revival    and a variety of
styles  rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the civil war and typically follow
and late victorian designs  georgetown s
