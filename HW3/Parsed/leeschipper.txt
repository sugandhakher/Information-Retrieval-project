leon jay  lee  schipper  april 7  1947  august 16  2011  was an
expert and international
who devoted his life to understanding societal  infrastructural and technological challenges to energy efficiency  particularly in the heating and transport sectors 
lee schipper attended the
in september 1964  studying physics and music  he completed his double-major b a  in 1968  moving straight into his phd in astrophysics in the physics department  he completed his phd in 1985 
at the time of his death  schipper was a senior research scientist at both
and at the
conducting research and policy analysis on efficient energy use in transportation systems  he was co-founder of   the world resources institute center for sustainable transport  and remained as a senior associate emeritus  over a highly productive career  he worked at the     the
in paris 
in london  as well as being
at the
in stockholm  he was a guest researcher at the   vvs tekniska foereningen  the   and the   he worked closely with the
and  
schipper authored more than 100 technical papers and a number of books on
and transportation  including
 1992  with   richard howarth  and ruth steiner  he served on the editorial boards of five major journals and was a member of the swedish board for transportation and communications research  for four years he was a member of the u s  s s committee on sustainable transport and committee on developing countries  he contributed to the second and third assessment reports of the   which was awarded the
in 2007  he was due to act as
for the chapter on transport in working group iii s contribution to the fifth assessment report  released in april 2014 
in berkeley in the early 1970s  professor   later to become president obamas science advisor  was the first person to hire schipper as an energy specialist  he notes that lee was one of the first people to point out that people dont want to consume energy  but they want to consume energy services  like transportation  comfortable rooms  cold beer and so forth  and that there was an enormous variation in the amount of energy needed to perform those services  lee s seminal contribution came in 1976  between the first and second international oil shocks  when he published an influential paper in
pointing out that sweden consumed far less energy per unit of economic activity than the united states did  lee shifted his primary attention to transport in the 1980s and started the berkeley labs international energy studies group with   and the two co-led the group for many years  schipper broke new ground by analyzing energy data sector by sector and end-use by end-use in various countries and comparing them  he demonstrated that energy intensity did not correlate with gdp in any simple way and was able to show why   the work he did has been carried on here  he created an important tradition of understanding energy by studying it from the bottom up  which means by end user   levine said   lee was the founding father of a school of energy analysts  a tradition carried on with vigor in the energy analysis department at lbnl  
he was described as being an irrepressible
with a wonderful knack of turning a phrase to excellent effect  evidence for this was publishing 15 letters to the editor in the new york times on energy efficiency  for example  in his view the  cash for clunkers  programwhich offered rebates to people who bought a new car with better mileage than their old onedid little to save energy  although it may have reduced air pollution  in many cases  buyers used the rebate to buy something bigger and more high-powered than they would have otherwise   the effect is inverse of what we were hoping for  he said 
schipper was also an accomplished musician with a b a  in music from u c  berkeley  he was the leader of the university of california jazz quintet in 1968  as a uc berkeley student and vibraphonist  he led his jazz group to victory at the notre dame jazz festival in 1967  in 1969 danish saxophonist carsten meinert invited him to record on his album  c m  musictrain  in denmark  spectator records   in 1973 he recorded  the phunky physicist  with swedish guitarplayer janne schaffer  he would reprise the role as band leader with an ad hoc jazz group  lee schipper and the mitigators  who performed primarily in conjunction with energy-related conferences 
he was also one of the worlds experts on   perhaps the greatest symphonic and operatic conductor of the 20th century  and collected one of the most complete sets of his recordings
