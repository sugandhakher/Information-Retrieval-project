retail energy markets  
in retail energy markets  supplier obligations are settled on an hourly or subhourly basis  for most customers  consumption is measured on a monthly basis  based on meter reading schedules  load profiles are used to convert the monthly consumption data into estimates of hourly or subhourly consumption in order to determine the supplier obligation  for each hour  these estimates are aggregated for all customers of an energy supplier  and the aggregate amount is used in market settlement calculations as the total demand that must be covered by the supplier 
calculating and recording load profiles  
load profiles can be determined by direct metering but on smaller devices such as distribution network transformers this is not routinely done  instead a load profile can be inferred from customer billing or other data  an example of a practical calculation used by utilities is using a transformer s maximum demand reading and taking into account the known number of each customer type supplied by these transformers  this process is called  
actual demand can be collected at strategic locations to perform more detailed load analysis  this is beneficial to both distribution and end-user customers looking for peak consumption 
  utility meter load profilers  data logging sub-meters and portable data loggers are designed to accomplish this task by recording readings at a set interval
