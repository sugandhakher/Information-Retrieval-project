bioenergy is
made available from materials derived from biological sources  biomass is any organic material which has stored sunlight in the form of chemical energy  as a fuel it may include   wood waste        and many other by-products from a variety of agricultural processes  by 2010  there was 35gw  47,000,000hp  of globally installed bioenergy capacity for electricity generation  of which 7gw  9,400,000hp  was in the  
in its most narrow sense it is a synonym to   which is fuel derived from biological sources  in its broader sense it includes   the biological material used as a biofuel  as well as the social  economic  scientific and technical fields associated with using biological sources for energy  this is a common misconception  as bioenergy is the energy extracted from the biomass  as the biomass is the fuel and the bioenergy is the energy contained in the fuel
there is a slight tendency for the word bioenergy to be favoured in europe compared with biofuel in america

solid biomass  
main article 
simple use of biomass fuel  combustion of
for heat  
one of the advantages of biomass fuel is that it is often a by-product  residue or waste-product of other processes  such as farming  animal husbandry and forestry  in theory this means there is no competition between fuel and food production  although this is not always the case  land use  existing biomass industries and relevant conversion technologies must be considered when evaluating suitability of developing biomass as feedstock for energy 
biomass is the material derived from recently living   which includes plants  animals and their byproducts  manure  garden waste and crop residues are all sources of biomass  it is a renewable energy source based on the   unlike other
such as     and
fuels  another source includes   which is a persistent and unavoidable
produced primarily by the animals housed in industrial-sized farms 
there are also agricultural products specifically being grown for
production  these include   and
and to some extent
and
on a pre-commercial research level  primarily in the united states        and willow  15,000ha or 37,000 acres in sweden  primarily in europe  sugarcane in brazil 
and
in southeast asia 
and
in china  and
in india 
has also been proven to work as a biofuel 
outputs from industry  agriculture  forestry and households can be used for biofuel production  using e g 
to produce  
to produce
or by direct combustion  examples of
include straw  timber  manure  rice husks  sewage  and food waste  the use of biomass fuels can therefore contribute to waste management as well as fuel security and help to prevent or slow down   although alone they are not a comprehensive solution to these problems 
biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel  rotting garbage  and agricultural and human waste  all release methane gasalso called  landfill gas  or  biogas   crops  such as corn and sugar cane  can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel  ethanol  biodiesel  another transportation fuel  can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats  also  biomass to liquids  btls  and cellulosic ethanol are still under research 
sewage biomass  
a new bioenergy
process aimed at developing countries is now on the horizon  the
is a self-sustaining process which uses the sewerage solids as fuel to convert sewage waste water into drinking water and electrical energy 
electricity generation from biomass  
the biomass used for electricity production ranges by region  forest byproducts  such as wood residues  are popular in the   agricultural waste is common in
 sugar cane residue  and
 rice husks   animal husbandry residues  such as poultry litter  is popular in the  
electricity from sugarcane bagasse in brazil  
 saccharum officinarum  plantation ready for harvest      brazil 
a sugar ethanol plant located in     this plant produces the electricity it needs from
residuals from sugarcane left over by the milling process  and it sells the surplus electricity to the public grid 
sucrose accounts for little more than 30  of the chemical energy stored in the mature plant  35  is in the leaves and stem tips  which are left in the fields during harvest  and 35  are in the fibrous material  bagasse  left over from pressing 
the production process of sugar and ethanol in brazil takes full advantage of the energy stored in   part of the bagasse is currently burned at the mill to provide heat for distillation and electricity to run the machinery  this allows ethanol plants to be energetically self-sufficient and even sell surplus electricity to utilities  current production is 600mw  800,000hp  for self-use and 100mw  130,000hp  for sale  this secondary activity is expected to boom now that utilities have been induced to pay  fair price   about us 10 gj or us 0.036 kwh  for 10 year contracts  this is approximately half of what the world bank considers the reference price for investing in similar projects  see below   the energy is especially valuable to utilities because it is produced mainly in the dry season when hydroelectric dams are running low  estimates of potential power generation from bagasse range from 1,000 to 9,000mw  1,300,000 to 12,100,000hp   depending on technology  higher estimates assume gasification of biomass  replacement of current low-pressure steam boilers and turbines by high-pressure ones  and use of harvest trash currently left behind in the fields  for comparison  brazil s
generates 657mw  881,000hp  
presently  it is economically viable to extract about 288 mj of electricity from the residues of one tonne of sugarcane  of which about 180 mj are used in the plant itself  thus a medium-size distillery processing 1,000,000 tonnes  980,000 long tons  1,100,000 short tons  of sugarcane per year could sell about 5mw  6,700hp  of surplus electricity  at current prices  it would earn us 18 million from sugar and ethanol sales  and about us 1 million from surplus electricity sales  with advanced boiler and turbine technology  the electricity yield could be increased to 648 mj per tonne of sugarcane  but current electricity prices do not justify the necessary investment   according to one report  the world bank would only finance investments in bagasse power generation if the price were at least us 19 gj or us 0.068 kwh  
bagasse burning is
compared to other fuels like oil and coal  its ash content is only 2.5   against 3050  of coal   and it contains very little sulfur  since it burns at relatively low temperatures  it produces little nitrous oxides  moreover  bagasse is being sold for use as a fuel  replacing heavy fuel oil  in various industries  including citrus juice concentrate  vegetable oil  ceramics  and tyre recycling  the
alone used 2,000,000 tonnes  1,970,000 long tons  2,200,000 short tons   saving about us 35 million in fuel oil imports 
researchers working with
are trying to make the extraction of ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and other plants viable on an industrial scale 
electricity from electrogenic micro-organisms  
another form of bioenergy can be attained from   in which chemical energy stored in wastewater or soil is converted directly into electrical energy via the metabolic processes of electrogenic micro-organisms  the power generation capability of this technology has not been economical to date  however  and this technology has found more utility for chemical treatment processes

environmental impact  
further information 
some forms of forest bioenergy have recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations  including
and the   for the harmful impacts they can have on forests and the climate  greenpeace recently released a report entitled
which outlines their concerns around forest bioenergy  because any part of the tree can be burned  the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages   which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting  and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest  in some jurisdictions  forest biomass is increasingly consisting of elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems  including standing trees  naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest  environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees  and even longer in low productivity areas  furthermore  logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon  in light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the effects of climate change  a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production 
the
described a scenario in a september 2016 article which illustrated why the journal believed bioenergy can be bad  suppose you cut down a 50 year oak tree in your garden and use the logs to heat your house instead of coal  wood emits more carbon dioxide than coal per unit of heat gained and the roots left in the soil emit more carbon dioxide as they rot  if you plant another tree it will soak up that carbon dioxide in about 50 years  but if you had left the original tree in place it would have soaked up the carbon dioxide from the coal and more  it could take centuries before cutting down the tree would give any benefit  but the world needed to cut carbon dioxide over the next few decades if the global warming was to be kept below 3 degrees c  the journal also concluded that official claimed carbon reductions from renewables had been overstated  the   for example  got more 64  of its renewable energy from biomass  mostly wood  but
and eu rules did not count the carbon emissions from burning biomass
