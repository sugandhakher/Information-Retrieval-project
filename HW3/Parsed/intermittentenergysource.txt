the 150 mw
is a commercial
power plant  located in   the andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isn t shining 
construction of the salt tanks which provide efficient
so that output can be provided after the sun goes down  and output can be scheduled to meet demand requirements  the 280mw
is designed to provide six hours of energy storage  this allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year 
an intermittent energy source is any source of
or
that is not continuously available due to some factor outside direct control  the intermittent source may be quite predictable  for example    but cannot be
to meet the demand of a power system  effective use of intermittent sources in an electric power grid usually relies on using the intermittent sources to displace fuel that would otherwise be consumed by   or by storing energy in the form of renewable   compressed air or ice  or in   for use when needed  or as electrode heating for district heating schemes 
the capacity of a reliable
supply  can be fulfilled by the use of   using mixed renewables to produce electricity   which may be utilised to meet regular and unanticipated supply demands  additionally  the storage of energy to fill the shortfall intermittency or for emergencies can be part of a
power supply 
the penetration of intermittent renewables in most power grids is low  global electricity production in 2014 was supplied by 3.1  wind  and 1  solar  wind generates roughly 16  of electric energy in
and   15.3  in   and 7  in   as of 2014  wind provides 39  of the electricity generated in   to operate with this level of penetration  denmark exports surpluses and imports during shortfalls to and from neighbouring countries  particularly hydroelectric power from norway  to balance supply with demand  it also uses large numbers of combined heat and power    stations which can rapidly adjust output 
the use of small amounts of intermittent power has little effect on
operations  using larger amounts of intermittent power may require upgrades or even a redesign of the grid infrastructure

terminology  
several key terms are useful for understanding the issue of intermittent power sources  these terms are not standardized  and variations may be used  most of these terms also apply to traditional power plants 
intermittency can mean the extent to which a power source is unintentionally stopped or unavailable  but intermittency is frequently used as though it were synonymous with variability 
variability is the extent to which a power source may exhibit undesired or uncontrolled changes in output 
or maneuverability is the ability of a given power source to increase and or decrease output quickly on demand  the concept is distinct from intermittency  maneuverability is one of several ways grid operators match output  supply  to system demand 
nominal or   or maximum effect refers to the normal maximum output of a generating source  this is the most common number used and is typically expressed in  
  average capacity factor  or load factor is the average expected output of a generator  usually over an annual period  expressed as a percentage of the nameplate capacity or in decimal form  e g  30  or 0.30  
  generally  the amount of output from a power source that may be statistically relied upon  expressed as a percentage 
penetration in this context is generally used to refer to the amount of energy generated as a percentage of annual consumption 
firm capacity the amount of power that can be guaranteed to be provided as
non-firm capacity the amount of power above the firm capacity that is usually to be sold at higher price on the
intermittency of various power sources

seasonal variation of the output of the solar panels at at t park in san francisco
intermittency inherently affects solar energy  as the production of electricity from solar sources depends on the amount of sunlight at a given place and time  solar output varies throughout the day and through the seasons  and is affected by dust  cloud cover  frost or snow  many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable  and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day 
intermittency  in the absence of an energy storage system  solar does not produce power at night or in bad weather and varies between summer and winter  when intended to produce electricity only for peak air conditioning loads  there is no intermittency

the extent to which the intermittency of solar-generated electricity is an issue will depend on the degree to which the generation profile of solar corresponds to demand  for example  solar thermal power plants such as
are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands  such as the south-western united states  thermal energy storage systems like the small spanish
can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption  the improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity  and extends the total time the system generates power 
wind energy  
monthly output over a two-year period
a
in    
over the entire year more than 20 percent of south dakota s electricity is generated from wind power 
wind-generated power is a variable resource  and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds  air density  and turbine characteristics  among other factors   if wind speed is too low  less than about 2.5m s  then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity  and if it is too high  more than about 25m s  the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage  while the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary  as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable 
intermittence  a single wind turbine is highly intermittent  theoretical arguments often claim that wind farms spread over a geographically diverse area will as a whole rarely stop producing power altogether  however this is in contradiction to the observed variability in total power output of wind turbines installed in ireland and denmark 
capacity factor  wind power typically has a capacity factor of 20-40  
dispatchability  wind power is  highly non-dispatchable   miso  which operates a large section of the u s  grid  has over 13,000mw of wind power under its control and is able to manage this large amount of wind power by operating it as dispatchable intermittent resources 
capacity credit  at low levels of penetration  the capacity credit of wind is about the same as the capacity factor  as the concentration of wind power on the grid rises  the capacity credit percentage drops 
variability  site dependent  sea breezes are much more constant than land breezes 
reliability  a wind farm is highly reliable  although highly intermittent   that is  the output at any given time will only vary gradually due to falling wind speeds or storms  the latter necessitating shut downs   a typical wind farm is unlikely to have to shut down in less than half an hour at the extreme  whereas an equivalent sized power station can fail totally instantaneously and without warning  the total shut down of wind turbines is predictable via weather forecasting  the average availability of a wind turbine is 98   and when a turbine fails or is shutdown for maintenance it only affects a small percentage of the output of a large wind farm 
according to a study of wind in the united states  ten or more widely separated wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47  of their average output  1520  of nominal capacity  as reliable 
power  as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height  when calculating the generating capacity available to meet summer peak demand 
 manages texas grid  counts wind generation at 8.7  of nameplate capacity 
wind generates about 16   ewea  2011 european statistics  february 2012  of electric energy in
and   9  in   and 7  in   wind provides nearly 20  of the electricity generated in   to meet this percentage denmark exports surpluses and imports during shortfalls to and from the eu grid  particularly norwegien hydro  to balance supply with demand  it also uses large numbers of combined heat and power stations which can rapidly flex output  the large thermal stores in these systems are also utilised to store surplus wind energy  since thermal storage is the cheapest form of energy storage 
because wind power is generated by large numbers of small generators  individual failures do not have large impacts on power grids  this feature of wind has been referred to as resiliency 
wind power is affected by air temperature because colder air is more dense and therefore more effective at producing wind power  as a result  wind power is affected seasonally  more output in winter than summer  and by daily temperature variations  during the
output from
significantly decreased to an average of 4  of capacity for seven days  a similar result was seen during the   when the output of wind power in france  germany  and spain fell below 10  during peak demand times

according to an article in energypulse   the development and expansion of well-functioning day-ahead and real time markets will provide an effective means of dealing with the variability of wind generation  
nuclear power  
several authors have said that no energy resource is totally reliable 
says that nuclear power plants are
in that they will sometimes fail unexpectedly  often for long periods of time  for example  in the united states  132 nuclear plants were built  and 21  were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems  while another 27  have at least once completely failed for a year or more  the remaining u s  nuclear plants produce approximately 90  of their full-time full-load potential  but even they must shut down  on average  for 39 days every 17 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance  to cope with such intermittence by nuclear  and centralized fossil-fuelled  power plants  utilities install a  reserve margin  of roughly 15  extra capacity spinning ready for instant use 
solid fuel nuclear plants have an additional disadvantage  for safety  they must instantly shut down in a power failure  but for nuclear-physics reasons  they cant be restarted quickly  for example  during the   nine operating u s  nuclear units had to shut down and were later restarted  during the first three days  while they were most needed  their output was less than 3  of normal  after twelve days of restart  their average capacity loss had exceeded 50 percent  liquid fuel nuclear plants  particularly those with their fuel dissolved in salts  don t have the same downtime issues  their nuclear fuel goes into a drain tank when any failure inside or outside occurs  this happens passively when the freeze plug melts because of the heat created by fission  in operation the freeze plug is actively cooled   the fuel is cooled passively and slowly  so when a restart is requested the fuel salt can simply be pumped back into the reactor core as it is stil a liquid  if the plant was shut down longer  the fuel needs to be reheated electrically and then pumped back  the reason a solid fuel reactor can t be restarted within seconds is because of the buildup of xenon  a radioactive gas that absorbs a lot of neutrons  as it is a gas it simply comes out of solution in a liquid fuel reactor and does not affect the restart process 
solving intermittency  
see also 
the intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources can be reduced and accommodated by diversifying their technology type and geographical location  forecasting their variation  and integrating them with dispatchable renewables  such as hydropower  geothermal  and biomass   combining this with energy storage and demand response can create a power system that can reliably match real-time energy demand  the integration of ever-higher levels of renewables has already been successfully demonstrated 
in 2009  eight american and three european authorities  writing in the leading electrical engineers  professional journal  didn t find  a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids   in fact  not one of more than 200 international studies  nor official studies for the eastern and western u s  regions  nor the   has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30  variable renewable supplies into the grid  and in some studies much more 
a research group at harvard university quantified the meteorologically defined limits to reduction in the variability of outputs from a coupled wind farm system in the central us 
the problem with the output from a single wind farm located in any particular region is that it is variable on time scales ranging from minutes to days posing difficulties for incorporating relevant outputs into an integrated power system  the high frequency  shorter than once per day  variability of contributions from individual wind farms is determined mainly by locally generated small scale boundary layer  the low frequency variability  longer than once per day  is associated with the passage of transient waves in the atmosphere with a characteristic time scale of several days  the high frequency variability of wind-generated power can be significantly reduced by coupling outputs from 5 to 10 wind farms distributed uniformly over a ten state region of the central us  more than 95  of the remaining variability of the coupled system is concentrated at time scales longer than a day  allowing operators to take advantage of multi-day weather forecasts in scheduling projected contributions from wind 
has studied how wind  water and solar technologies can be integrated to provide the majority of the world s energy needs  he advocates a  smart mix  of
sources to reliably meet electricity demand 
because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind  combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand  especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps 
mark a  delucchi and mark z  jacobson argue that there are at least seven ways to design and operate renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand 
interconnect geographically dispersed  technologically diverse renewable generation types  such as wind  solar  and tidal  to smooth out daily supply variability  for example  solar power generation is highest at midday  and wind is often strongest at night and early morning  the combined solar-wind resource has lower variance than either individual source 
use dispatchable renewable energy generators  such as hydroelectric  geothermal  and biomass  to fill energy deficits between demand and intermittent resource generation 
use demand response  or demand-side management  to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available  and away from times when renewable generation is low  this requires that loads be capable of receiving and responding to price or control signals from the local utility or grid operator 
store excess renewable power  which would otherwise be curtailed  for later use at times when generation is not sufficient to meet load  some energy storage technology types include pumped hydro  electrochemical batteries  flywheels  compressed air  and hydrogen  these energy storage resources can be located near intermittent generation  behind the meter at homes and business  or at any other point on the electric grid  customer-sited storage is typically used to increase self-consumption of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic panels  to shift grid power consumption towards off-peak hours  and to reduce demand charges  grid-scale storage is typically used to provide ancillary services to the grid  such as frequency regulation  synchronous spinning reserve capacity  and load-following 
over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand  and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses 
use electric vehicles as an additional storage resource  the first generation of this technology  known as v1g  unidirectional managed charging   involves smart charging at times when the grid can accommodate additional load  with power only flowing into the vehicle  a further development  known as v2b  vehicle-to-building   sees bidirectional power flow into the vehicle at optimal times  and out of the vehicle to meet building demand  the most advanced form  known as v2g     sees power exported from the ev back on to the grid when needed 
forecast the weather  winds  sunlight  waves  tides and precipitation  to better plan for energy supply needs 
technological solutions to mitigate large-scale wind energy type intermittency exist such as increased interconnection  the       
 in the   frequency response  
type schemes  and use of existing power stations on standby  studies by academics and grid operators indicate that the cost of compensating for intermittency is expected to be high at levels of penetration above the low levels currently in use today large  distributed power grids are better able to deal with high levels of penetration than small  isolated grids  for a hypothetical european-wide power grid  analysis has shown that wind energy penetration levels as high as 70  are viable  and that the cost of the extra transmission lines would be only around 10  of the turbine cost  yielding power at around present day prices  smaller grids may be less tolerant to high levels of penetration 
matching power demand to supply is not a problem specific to intermittent power sources  existing power grids already contain elements of uncertainty including sudden and large changes in demand and unforeseen power plant failures  though power grids are already designed to have some capacity in excess of projected peak demand to deal with these problems  significant upgrades may be required to accommodate large amounts of intermittent power  the
states   in the case of wind power  operational reserve is the additional generating reserve needed to ensure that differences between forecast and actual volumes of generation and demand can be met  again  it has to be noted that already significant amounts of this reserve are operating on the grid due to the general safety and quality demands of the grid  wind imposes additional demands only inasmuch as it increases variability and unpredictability  however  these factors are nothing completely new to system operators  by adding another variable  wind power changes the degree of uncertainty  but not the kind    
compensating for variability  
see also 
all sources of electrical power have some degree of unpredictability  and demand patterns routinely drive large swings in the amount of electricity that suppliers feed into the grid  wherever possible  grid operations procedures are designed to match supply with demand at high levels of reliability  and the tools to influence supply and demand are well-developed  the introduction of large amounts of highly variable power generation may require changes to existing procedures and additional investments 
operational reserve  
see also 
all managed grids already have existing operational and  spinning  reserve to compensate for existing uncertainties in the power grid  the addition of intermittent resources such as wind does not require 100   back-up  because operating reserves and balancing requirements are calculated on a system-wide basis  and not dedicated to a specific generating plant 
some coal  gas  or hydro power plants are partially loaded and then controlled to change as demand changes or to replace rapidly lost generation  the ability to change as demand changes is termed  response   the ability to quickly replace lost generation  typically within timescales of 30seconds to 30minutes  is termed  spinning reserve  
generally thermal plants running as
will be less efficient than if they were running as  
hydroelectric facilities with storage capacity  such as the traditional dam configuration  may be operated as base load or peaking plants 
in practice  as the power output from wind varies  partially loaded conventional plants  which are already present to provide response and reserve  adjust their output to compensate 
while low penetrations of intermittent power may utilize existing levels of response and spinning reserve  the larger overall variations at higher penetrations levels will require additional reserves or other means of compensation 
demand reduction or increase  
refers to the use of communication and switching devices which can release deferrable loads quickly  or absorb additional energy to correct supply demand imbalances  incentives have been widely created in the american  british and french systems for the use of these systems  such as favorable rates or capital cost assistance  encouraging consumers with large loads to take them off line or to start diesels whenever there is a shortage of capacity  or conversely to increase load when there is a surplus 
certain types of load control allow the power company to turn loads off remotely if insufficient power is available  in france large users such as cern cut power usage as required by the system operator - edf under the encouragement of the ejp tariff 
refers to incentives to adjust use of electricity  such as higher rates during peak hours 
real-time variable electricity pricing can encourage users to adjust usage to take advantage of periods when power is cheaply available and avoid periods when it is more scarce and expensive 
instantaneous demand reduction  most large systems also have a category of loads which instantly disconnect when there is a generation shortage  under some mutually beneficial contract  this can give instant load reductions  or increases   see
diesel generators  originally or primarily installed for emergency power supply are often also connected to the national grid in the uk to help deal with short term demand supply mismatches 
storage and demand loading  
main article 
at times of low or falling demand where wind output may be high or increasing  grid stability may require lowering the output of various generating sources or even increasing demand  possibly by using energy storage to time-shift output to times of higher demand  such mechanisms can include 
pumped storage hydropower is the most prevalent existing technology used  and can substantially improve the economics of wind power  the availability of hydropower sites suitable for storage will vary from grid to grid  typical round trip efficiency is 80   see also

ice can be stored inter seasonally and can be used as a source of air-conditioning during periods of high demand  present systems only need to store ice for a few hours but are well developed

traditional lithium-ion batteries have a large environmental footprint  but new technologies such as air-breathing batteries could provide an enviro-friendly solution to renewable energy storage 
some loads such as desalination plants  electric boilers and industrial refrigeration units  are able to store their output  water and heat   these  opportunistic loads  are able to take advantage of  burst electricity  when it is available 
various other potential applications are being considered  such as charging plug-in electric vehicles during periods of low demand and high production  such technologies are not widely used at this time 
storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient  storage may also require substantial capital investment and space for storage facilities 
geographic diversity  
the variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high  combining any additional number of turbines  for example  in a wind farm  results in lower statistical variation  as long as the
between the output of each turbine is imperfect  and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine  similarly  geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations  reducing overall variability  since wind power is dependent on weather systems  there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system 
multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations 
with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts  especially from large numbers of turbines farms  the ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected  especially from newer facilities 
complementary power sources and matching demand  
electricity produced from solar energy could be a counterbalance to the fluctuating supplies generated from wind  in some locations  it tends to be windier at night and during cloudy or stormy weather  so there is likely to be more sunshine when there is less wind 
in some locations  electricity demand may have a high correlation with wind output  particularly in locations where cold temperatures drive electric consumption  as cold air is denser and carries more energy  
intermittent solar electricity generation has a direct correlation where hot sunny weather drives high cooling demands  this is an ideal relationship between intermittent energy and demand 
the allowable penetration may be further increased by increasing the amount of part-loaded generation available  systems with existing high levels of
generation may be able to incorporate substantial amounts of wind  although high hydro penetration may indicate that hydro is already a low-cost source of electricity      and
all have high levels of existing hydroelectric generation  quebec produces over 90  of its electricity from hydropower  and the local utility    is the largest single hydropower producer in the world   the u s  pacific northwest has been identified as another region where wind energy is complemented well by existing hydropower  and there were  no fundamental technical barriers  to integrating up to 6,000mw of wind capacity  storage capacity in hydropower facilities will be limited by size of reservoir  and environmental and other considerations

export   import arrangements with neighboring systems  
it is often feasible to export energy to neighboring grids at times of surplus  and import energy when needed  this practice is common in western europe and north america 
integration with other grids can lower the effective concentration of variable power  denmark s 44  penetration  in the context of the german dutch  with which it has interconnections  is considerably lower as a proportion of the total system  this effect is diminished if more neighboring grids also have high penetration levels of variable power 
integration of grids may decrease the overall variability of both supply and demand by increasing geographical diversity 
methods of compensating for power variability in one grid  such as peaking-plants or pumped-storage hydro-electricity  may be taken advantage of by importing variable power from another grid that is short on such capabilities 
the capacity of power transmission infrastructure may have to be substantially upgraded to support export import plans 
some energy is lost in transmission 
the economic value of exporting variable power depends in part on the ability of the exporting grid to provide the importing grid with useful power at useful times for an attractive price

and
penetration  
penetration refers to the proportion of a power source on a system  expressed as a percentage  there are several ways that this can be calculated  with the different methods yielding different penetrations  it can be calculated either as 
the nominal capacity of a power source divided by peak demand  or
the nominal capacity of a power source divided by total capacity  or
the average power generated by a power source  divided by the average system demand 
the level of penetration of intermittent variable sources is significant for the following reasons 
power grids with significant amounts  
or other
such as natural gas-fired power plants are more inherently capable of accommodating fluctuations from intermittent power 
isolated  relatively small systems with only a few wind plants may only be stable and economic with a lower fraction of wind energy  e g  ireland   although mixed wind diesel systems have been used in isolated communities with success at relatively high penetration levels 
renewable electricity supply in the 20-50   penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems  albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system 
in 2010  four german states  totaling 10 million people  relied on wind power for 43-52  of their annual electricity needs  denmark isn t far behind  supplying 22  of its power from wind in 2010  26  in an average wind year   the extremadura region of spain is getting up to 25  of its electricity from solar  while the whole country meets 16  of its demand from wind  just during 2005-2010  portugal vaulted from 17  to 45  renewable electricity 
there is no generally accepted maximum level of penetration  as each system s capacity to compensate for intermittency differs  and the systems themselves will change over time  discussion of acceptable or unacceptable penetration figures should be treated and used with caution  as the relevance or significance will be highly dependent on local factors  grid structure and management  and existing generation capacity 
for most systems worldwide  existing penetration levels are significantly lower than practical or theoretical maximums  for example  a uk study found that  it is clear that intermittent generation need not compromise electricity system reliability at any level of penetration foreseeable in britain over the next 20 years  although it may increase costs  
maximum penetration limits  
there is no generally accepted maximum penetration of wind energy that would be feasible in any given grid  rather  economic efficiency and cost considerations are more likely to dominate as critical factors  technical solutions may allow higher penetration levels to be considered in future  particularly if cost considerations are secondary 
high penetration scenarios may be feasible in certain circumstances 
power generation for periods of little or no wind generation can be provided by retaining the existing power stations  the cost of using existing power stations for this purpose may be low since fuel costs dominate the operating costs  the actual cost of paying to keep a power station idle  but usable at short notice  may be estimated from published
and   as existing traditional plant ages  the cost of replacing or refurbishing these facilities will become part of the cost of high-penetration wind if they are used only to provide operational reserve 
automatic load shedding of large industrial loads and its subsequent automatic reconnection is established technology and used in the uk and u s   and known as
in the uk  several gw are switched off and on each month in the uk in this way  reserve service contractors offer
and even faster diesels in the uk  france and u s  to control grid stability 
in a close-to-100  wind scenario  surplus wind power can be allowed for by increasing the levels of the existing reserve and frequency service schemes and by extending the scheme to domestic-sized loads  energy can be stored by advancing deferrable domestic loads such as storage heaters  water heaters  fridge motors  or even   and load can be shed by turning such equipment off 
alternatively or additionally  power can be exported to neighboring grids and re-imported later  hvdc cables are efficient with 3  loss per 1000km and may be inexpensive in certain circumstances  for example  an 8 gw link from uk to france would cost about 1billion using
cables  under such scenarios  the amount of transmission capacity required may be many times higher than currently available 
penetration studies  
studies have been conducted to assess the viability of specific penetration levels in specific energy markets 
european super grid  
a series of detailed modelling studies by dr  gregor czisch  which looked at the european wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids the
using
cables  indicates that the entire european power usage could come from renewables  with 70  total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present  this proposed large european power grid has been called a    
the model deals with intermittent power issues by using base-load renewables such as hydroelectric and biomass for a substantial portion of the remaining 30  and by heavy use of hvdc to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas  the report states that  electricity transport proves to be one of the keys to an economical electricity supply  and underscores the importance of  international co-operation in the field of renewable energy use  and  transmission  
dr  czisch described the concept in an interview  saying  for example  if we look at wind energy in europe  we have a winter wind region where the maximum production is in winter and in the sahara region in northern africa the highest wind production is in the summer and if you combine both  you come quite close to the needs of the people living in the whole area - let s say from northern russia down to the southern part of the sahara  
grid study in ireland  
a study of the grid in
indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42   of demand  renewables in the electricity mix  this acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called scenario 5  provided 47  of electrical capacity  different from demand  with the following mix of renewable energies 
6,000 mw wind
360 mw base load renewables
285 mw additional variable renewables  other intermittent sources 
the study cautions that various assumptions were made that  may have understated dispatch restrictions  resulting in an underestimation of operational costs  required wind curtailment  and co2 emissions  and that  the limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed    
scenario 6  which proposed renewables providing 59  of electrical capacity and 54  of demand had problems  scenario 6 proposed the following mix of renewable energies 
8,000 mw wind
392 mw base load renewables
1,685 mw additional variable renewables  other intermittent sources 
the study found that for scenario 6   a significant number of hours characterized by extreme system situations occurred where load and reserve requirements could not be met  the results of the network study indicated that for such extreme renewable penetration scenarios  a system re-design is required  rather than a reinforcement exercise   the study declined to analyze the cost effectiveness of the required changes because  determination of costs and benefits had become extremely dependent on the assumptions made  and this uncertainty would have impacted the robustness of the results 
canada  
a study published in october 2006  by the ontario independent electric system operator  ieso  found that  there would be minimal system operation impacts for levels of wind capacity up to 5,000mw   which corresponds to a peak penetration of 17 
denmark  
a november 2006 analysis  found that  wind power may be able to cover more than 50  of the danish electricity consumption in 2025  under conditions of high oil prices and higher costs for co2 allowances  denmark s two grids  covering west denmark and east denmark separately  each incorporate high-capacity interconnectors to neighbouring grids where some of the variations from wind are absorbed  in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50  by 2020  and to 84  in 2035 
economic impacts of variability  
estimates of the cost of wind energy may include estimates of the  external  costs of wind variability  or be limited to the cost of production  all electrical plant has costs that are separate from the cost of production  including  for example  the cost of any necessary transmission capacity or reserve capacity in case of loss of generating capacity  many types of generation  particularly fossil fuel derived  will also have cost
such as pollution  greenhouse gas emission  and habitat destruction which are generally not directly accounted for  the magnitude of the economic impacts is debated and will vary by location  but is expected to rise with higher penetration levels  at low penetration levels  costs such as
and balancing costs are believed to be insignificant 
intermittency may introduce additional costs that are distinct from or of a different magnitude than for traditional generation types  these may include 
transmission capacity  transmission capacity may be more expensive than for nuclear and coal generating capacity due to lower load factors  transmission capacity will generally be sized to projected peak output  but average capacity for wind will be significantly lower  raising cost per unit of energy actually transmitted  however transmission costs are a low fraction of total energy costs 
additional operating reserve  if additional wind does not correspond to demand patterns  additional operating reserve may be required compared to other generating types  however this does not result in higher capital costs for additional plants since this is merely existing plants running at low output - spinning reserve  contrary to statements that all wind must be backed by an equal amount of  back-up capacity   intermittent generators contribute to base capacity  as long as there is some probability of output during peak periods   back-up capacity is not attributed to individual generators  as back-up or operating reserve  only have meaning at the system level  
balancing costs  to maintain grid stability  some additional costs may be incurred for balancing of load with demand  the ability of the grid to balance supply with demand will depend on the rate of change of the amount of energy produced  by wind  for example  and the ability of other sources to ramp production up or scale production down  balancing costs have generally been found to be low 
storage  export and load management  at high penetrations  more than 30      solutions  described below  for dealing with high output of wind during periods of low demand may be required  these may require additional capital expenditures  or result in lower marginal income for wind producers 
analyses of costs  
studies have been performed to determine the costs of variability 
states 

a review of integration studies  worldwide  suggests that the additional costs of integrating wind are around 2 mwh with 10  wind  rising to 3 mwh with 20  wind 

colorado  separate reports by xcel and ucs  
an official at
claimed that at 20 percent penetration  additional standby generators to compensate for wind in colorado would cost  8 per mwh  adding between 13  and 16  to the us 5060 cost per mwh of wind energy 
the
conducted a study of the costs to increase the renewable penetration in colorado to 10  and found that for an average residential bill  customers of municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives that opt out of the solar energy requirement  would save 4 cents per month  but that for
customers there would be additional cost of about 10 cents per month  total impact on all consumers would be  4.5 million or 0.01  over two decades 
uk studies  
a detailed study for
 a private power company  states  we have estimated that for the case with 8,000mw of wind needed to meet the 10  renewables target for 2010  balancing costs can be expected to increase by around 2 per mwh of wind production  this would represent an additional 40million per annum  just over 10  of existing annual balancing costs  
in evidence to the uk house of lords economic affairs select committee  national grid have quoted estimates of balancing costs for 40  wind and these lie in the range 500-1000m per annum   these balancing costs represent an additional 6 to 12 per annum on average consumer electricity bill of around 390  
national grid notes that  increasing levels of such renewable generation on the system would increase the costs of balancing the system and managing system frequency  
a 2003 report  by
and the   projected costs of 1.6 to 2.4 billion for reinforcement and new build of transmission and distribution systems to support 10  renewable electricity in the uk by 2010  and 3.2bn to 4.5bn for 20  by 2020  the study classified  intermittency  as  not a significant issue  for the 2010 target but a  significant issue  for the 2020 target  see
minnesota  
a minnesota study on wind penetration levels and found that  total integration operating cost for up to 25  wind energy  would be less than  0.0045 per kwh  additional  
intermittency and renewable energy  
there are differing views about some sources of renewable energy and intermittency  the world nuclear association argues that the sun  wind  tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power  or peak-load power when it is needed  proponents of renewable energy use argue that the issue of intermittency of renewables is over-stated  and that practical experience demonstrates this  in any case 
has  like nuclear  no intermittency  but they both use the energy in radioactive materials like uranium  thorium and potassium  
views of critics of high penetration renewable energy use  
for many years there was a consensus within the electric utilities in the u s  that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they will never be able to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power  thomas petersnik  an analyst with the u s  energy information administration put it this way   by and large  renewable energy sources are too rare  too distant  too uncertain  and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need

according to a transatlantic collaborative research paper on  eroei   conducted by 6 analysts and led by d  weibach  as published in the
journal energy in 2013  the uncorrected for their intermittency  unbuffered   eroei for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right  while the buffered corrected for their intermittency  eroei stated in the paper for all
sources  with the exception of nuclear and biomass  were yet lower still  as when corrected for their weather intermittency  buffered   the eroei figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished - a reduction of eroei dependent on  
views of proponents of high penetration renewable energy use

the u s  federal energy regulatory commission  ferc  chairman jon wellinghoff has stated that  baseload capacity is going to become an anachronism  and that no new nuclear or coal plants may ever be needed in the united states  some renewable electricity sources have identical variability to   so they are   and can be integrated into the electricity supply system without any additional back-up  examples include 
  based on the combustion of crops and crop residues  or their gasification followed by combustion of the gas

grid operators in countries like denmark and spain now integrate large quantities of renewable energy into their electricity grids  with denmark receiving 40  of its electricity from
during some months 
supporters say that the total electricity generated from a large-scale array of dispersed   located in different wind regimes  cannot be accurately described as intermittent  because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously at irregular intervals  with a small amount of supplementary peak-load plant  which operates infrequently  large-scale distributed wind power can substitute for some base-load power and be equally reliable 
can be intermittent and or dispatchable  depending on the configuration of the plant  typical
plants in the dam configuration may have substantial storage capacity  and be considered dispatchable 
hydroelectric generation will typically have limited or no storage capacity  and will be variable on a seasonal or annual basis  dependent on rainfall and snow melt  
suggests a few basic strategies to deal with these issues 

 the variability of sun  wind and so on  turns out to be a non-problem if you do several sensible things  one is to diversify your renewables by technology  so that weather conditions bad for one kind are good for another  second  you diversify by site so they re not all subject to the same weather pattern at the same time because they re in the same place  third  you use standard weather forecasting techniques to forecast wind  sun and rain  and of course hydro operators do this right now  fourth  you integrate all your resources supply side and demand side    

moreover 
and
measures can reliably reduce demand for base-load and peak-load electricity 
international groups are studying much higher penetrations  30-   and conclusions are that these levels are also technically feasible  in the uk  one summary of other studies indicated that if assuming that wind power contributed less than 20  of uk power consumption  then the intermittency would cause only moderate cost 
methods to manage wind power integration range from those that are commonly used at present  e g    to potential new technologies for   improved
can also contribute as the daily and seasonal variations in wind and solar sources are to some extent predictable  the
and the
state in the
plan that resilience is a feature of renewable energy 

diversity and dispersal also add system security  if one wind turbine fails  the lights won t flicker  if an entire windfarm gets knocked out by a storm  only 40,000 people will lose power  if a single darlington reactor goes down  400,000 homes  or key industries  could face instant blackouts  to hedge this extra risk  high premiums have to be paid for decades to ensure large blocks of standby generation
