a product s service life is its period of use in service  it has been defined as  a product s total life in use from the point of sale to the point of discard  and contrasted with a products replacement life  the period after which the initial purchaser returns to the shop for a replacement   not to be confused with   which deals with storage time  it is the time that any manufactured item can be expected to be  serviceable  or
by its    
determining a products expected service life consists of   using tools and calculations from
and   service life is a unique commitment made by the item s manufacturer and is usually specified as a median  actual service life is the maximal recorded life of a product 
service life is different from a predicted life  or
 mean time to failure mean time between failures    maintenance-free operating period   predicted life is useful such that a manufacturer may estimate  by hypothetical modeling and calculation  a general rule for which it will honor
claims  or planning for mission fulfillment  the difference between service life and predicted life is most clear when considering mission time and reliability in comparison to
and service life  for example  a
system can have a mission time of less than one minute  a service life of 20 years  active mtbf of 20 minutes  dormant mtbf of 50 years and a reliability of  999999 
a
item will have different expectations about service and
based upon factors such as use  cost  and quality

product strategy  
will commit to very conservative service life  usually 2 to 5 years for most commercial and consumer products  for example
and    however  for large and expensive   the items are not   and service lives and maintenance activity will factor large in the service life  again  an airliner might have a mission time of 11 hours  a predicted active mtbf of 10,000 hours with maintenance  or 15,000 hours without maintenance   a reliability of  99999 and a service life of 40 years 
the most common model for item lifetime is the   a plot of the varying
as a function of time  during early life  the bathtub shows increased failures  usually witnessed during   the middle portion of the bathtub  or  useful life   is a slightly inclined  nearly
period where the consumer enjoys the benefit conferred by the product  as the time increases further  the curve reaches a period of increasing failures  modeling the product s wearout phase 
for an individual product  the component parts may each have independent service lives  resulting in several bathtub curves  for instance  a tire will have a service life partitioning related to the
and the casing 
examples  
for maintainable items  those wear-out items that are determined by logistical analysis to be provisioned for
and replacement will assure a longer service life than manufactured items without such planning  a simple example is automotive
- failure to plan for this wear out item would limit
to the extent of a single set of tires 
an individual tire s life follows the   to boot  after installation  there is a not-small probability of failure which may be related to material or workmanship or even to the process for mounting the tire which may introduce some small damage  after the initial period  the tire will perform  given no defect introducing event such as encountering a road hazard  a nail or a    for a long duration relative to its expected service life which is a function of several variables  design  material  process   after a period  the failure probability will rise  for some tires  this will occur after the tread is worn out  then  a secondary market for tires puts a
on the tire thereby extending the service life  it is not uncommon for an 80,000-mile tire to perform well beyond that limit 
it may be difficult to obtain reliable longevity data about many
products as  in general  efforts at
analysis are not taken to the same extent as found with that needed to support
decisions  however  some attempts to provide this type of information have been made  an example is the collection of estimates for household components provided by the old house web which gathers data from the appliance statistical review and various institutes involved with the homebuilding trade 
bol and eol  
for certain products  such as those that cannot be serviced during their operational life for technical reasons  a manufacturer may calculate a product s expected performance at both the beginning of operational life  bol  and
 eol   batteries and other components that degrade over time may affect the operation of a product  the performance of
components is therefore calculated for eol  with the components exceeding their
at bol  for example  with spaceflight hardware  which must survive in the harsh environment of space  the capacity to generate electricity from solar panels or
is likely to reduce throughout a mission  but must still meet a specific requirement at eol in order to complete the mission  a spacecraft may also have a bol mass that is greater than its eol mass as propellant is depleted during its operational life
