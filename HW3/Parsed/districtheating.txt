district heating  also known as heat networks or teleheating  is a system for distributing heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements such as
and   the heat is often obtained from a
plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly also   although    
and
are also used  as well as   district heating plants can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localised boilers  according to some research  district heating with combined heat and power  chpdh  is the cheapest method of cutting carbon emissions  and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all fossil generation plants  chpdh is being developed in denmark as a store for   particularly wind energy  that exceeds instantaneous grid demand via the use of heat pumps and thermal stores

heat generation  
heat sources in use for various district heating systems include  power plants designed for
 chp  also called co-generation   including both combustion and nuclear power plants  and simple combustion of a fossil fuel or biomass  geothermal heat  solar heat  industrial heat pumps which extract heat from seawater  river or lake water  sewage  or waste heat from industrial processes 
district heat from combined heat and power or simple combustion  
the core element of many district heating systems is a   additionally a
plant  also called   chp  is often added in parallel with the boilers  both have in common that they are typically based on combustion of primary energy carriers  the difference between the two systems is that  in a cogeneration plant  heat and electricity are generated simultaneously  whereas in heat-only boiler stations  as the name suggests  only heat is generated 
in the case of a fossil fueled cogeneration plant  the heat output is typically sized to meet half of the peak heat load but over the year will provide 90  of the heat supplied  the boiler capacity will be able to meet the entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the cogeneration plant  it is not economic to size the cogeneration plant alone to be able to meet the full heat load  in the   that is around 2.5 gw  germany has the largest amount of chp in europe 
the combination of cogeneration and district heating is very   a simple
can be 2035  efficient  whereas a more advanced facility with the ability to recover waste heat can reach total energy efficiency of nearly 80   some may exceed 100  based on the
by condensing the flue gas as well 
waste heat from nuclear power plants is sometimes used for district heating  the principles for a conventional combination of cogeneration and district heating applies the same for nuclear as it does for a   russia has several cogeneration nuclear plants which together provided 11.4 pj of district heat in 2005  russian nuclear district heating is planned to nearly triple within a decade as new plants are built 
other nuclear-powered heating from cogeneration plants are in the ukraine  the czech republic  slovakia  hungary  bulgaria  and switzerland  producing up to about 100mw per power station  one use of nuclear heat generation was with the
in sweden closed in 1974 
in switzerland  the
provides heat to about 20,000 people

history
geothermal district heating was used in   and in
since the 14th century 
united states
direct use geothermal district heating systems  which tap geothermal reservoirs and distribute the hot water to multiple buildings for a variety of uses  are uncommon in the united states  but have existed in america for over a century 
in 1890  the first wells were drilled to access a hot water resource outside of boise  idaho  in 1892  after routing the water to homes and businesses in the area via a wooden pipeline  the first geothermal district heating system was created 
as of a 2007 study  there were 22 geothermal district heating systems  gdhs  in the united states  as of 2010  two of those systems have shut down  the table below describes the 20 gdhs currently operational in america

solar-sourced district heat  
main article 
use of solar heat for district heating has been increasing in denmark and germany in recent years  the systems usually include inter for a consistent heat output day to day and between summer and winter  good examples are in
at 50 mw 
at 27 mw and marstal at 13 mw in denmark  these systems have been incrementally expanded to supply 10  to 40  of their villages  annual space heating needs  the solar-thermal panels are ground-mounted in fields  the heat storage is pit storage  borehole cluster and the traditional water tank  in alberta  canada the
has achieved a world record 97  annual solar fraction for heating needs  using solar-thermal panels on the garage roofs and thermal storage in a borehole cluster 
heat pumps for district heat  
perhaps best illustrated by the
in norway which produces 14 mw from water at just 8c  industrial heat pumps are demonstrated heat sources for district heating networks  among the ways that industrial heat pumps can be utilized are 
as the primary base load source where water from a low grade source of heat  e g  a river  fjord    power station outfall  sewage treatment works outfall  all typically between 0c and 25c   is boosted up to the network temperature of typically 60c to 90c using   these devices  although consuming electricity  will transfer a heat output three to six times larger than the amount of electricity consumed  an example of a district system using a heat pump to source heat from raw sewage is in oslo  norway that has a heat output of 18 mw thermal  
as a means of recovering heat from the cooling loop of a power plant to increase either the level of flue gas heat recovery  as the district heating plant return pipe is now cooled by the heat pump  or by cooling the closed steam loop and artificially lowering the condensing pressure and thereby increasing the electricity generation efficiency 
as a means of cooling flue gas scrubbing working fluid  typically water  from 60c post-injection to 20c pre-injection temperatures  heat is recovered using a heat pump and can be sold and injected into the network side of the facility at a much higher temperature  e g  about 80c  
where the network has reached capacity  large individual load users can be decoupled from the hot feed pipe  say 80c and coupled to the return pipe  at e g  40c  by adding a heat pump locally to this user  the 40c pipe is cooled further  the heat being delivered into the heat pump evaporator   the output from the heat pump is then a dedicated loop for the user at 40c to 70c  therefore  the overall network capacity has changed as the total temperature difference of the loop has varied from 8040c to 80cx  x being a value lower than 40c  
concerns have existed about the use of hydroflurocarbons as the working fluid  refrigerant  for large heat pumps  whilst leakage is not usually measured  it is generally reported to be relatively low  such as 1   compared to 25  for supermarket cooling systems   a 30-megawatt heatpump could therefore leak  annually  around 75kg of r134a or other working fluid  given the high global warming potential of some hfcs  this could equate to over 800,000 kilometres  500,000mi  of car travel per year   
however  recent technical advances allow the use of natural heat pump refrigerants that have very low global warming potential  gwp   co2 refrigerant  r744  gwp 1  or ammonia  r717  gwp 0  also have the benefit  depending on operating conditions  of resulting in higher heat pump efficiency than conventional refrigerants  an example is a 14 mw thermal  district heating network in
which is supplied by seawater-source heatpumps that use r717 refrigerant  and has been operating since 2011  90c water is delivered to the district loop  and returns at 65c   heat is extracted from seawater  from 60-foot  18m  depth  that is 8 to 9c all year round  giving an average coefficient of performance  cop  of about 3.15  in the process the seawater is chilled to 4c  however  this resource is not utilized  in a district system where the chilled water could be utilized for air conditioning  the effective cop would be considerably higher 
in the future  industrial
will be further de-carbonised by using  on one side  excess renewable electrical energy  otherwise spilled due to meeting of grid demand  from wind  solar  etc  and  on the other side  by making more of renewable heat sources  lake and ocean heat  geothermal  etc    furthermore  higher efficiency can be expected through operation on the high voltage network 
excess renewable electrical energy for district heat  
with european countries such as germany and denmark moving to very high levels  80  and 100  respectively by 2050  of renewable energy for all energy uses there will be increasing periods of excess production of renewable electrical energy  storage of this energy as potential electrical energy  e g  pumped hydro  is very costly and reduces total round-trip efficiency  however  storing it as heat in district heating systems  for use in buildings where there is demand  is significantly less costly  whilst the quality of the electrical energy is degraded  high voltage grid mw sized heat pumps would maximise efficiency whilst not wasting excess renewable electricity 
heat accumulators and storage  
district heating accumulation tower from theiss near
in
with a thermal capacity of 2 gigawatt-hours  7.2tj 
increasingly large heat stores are being used with district heating networks to maximise efficiency and financial returns  this allows cogeneration units to be run at times of maximum electrical tariff  the electrical production having much higher rates of return than heat production  whilst storing the excess heat production  it also allows solar heat to be collected in summer and redistributed off season in very large but relatively low-cost in-ground insulated reservoirs or borehole systems  the expected heat loss at the 203,000m insulated pond in
is about 8  
heat distribution  
underground tunnel for heat pipes between
and
in denmark
insulated pipes to connect a new building to  s campus-wide
system
district heating pipe in   germany
with a thermal power of 700 kw which insulates the water circuit of the district heating system and the customer s central heating system
after generation  the heat is distributed to the customer via a network of   district heating systems consist of feed and return lines  usually the pipes are installed underground but there are also systems with overground pipes  within the system
units may be installed to even out peak load demands 
the common medium used for heat distribution is water or   but
is also used  the advantage of steam is that in addition to heating purposes it can be used in
due to its higher temperature  the disadvantage of steam is a higher heat loss due to the high temperature  also  the
of cogeneration plants is significantly lower if the cooling medium is high-temperature steam  reducing
generation  heat transfer oils are generally not used for district heating  although they have higher heat capacities than water  as they are expensive  and have environmental issues 
at customer level the heat network is usually connected to the
system of the dwellings via
    the working fluids of both networks  generally water or steam  do not mix  however  direct connection is used in the
system 
typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10   as seen in norway s district heating network 
heat metering  
the amount of heat provided to customers is often recorded with a
to encourage conservation and maximize the number of customers which can be served  but such meters are expensive  due to the expense of heat metering  an alternative approach is simply to meter the water  water meters are much cheaper than heat meters  and have the advantage of encouraging consumers to extract as much heat as possible  leading to a very low return temperature  which increases the efficiency of power generation   
many systems were installed under a
economy  such as in the former    and these were often not metered  this led to great inefficiencies  users simply opened windows when too hot  wasting energy and minimising the numbers of connectable customers   
size of systems  
district heating systems can vary in size from covering entire cities such as stockholm or flensburg with a network of large meter diameter primary pipes linked to secondary pipes  200mm diameter perhaps  which in turn link to tertiary pipes of perhaps 25mm diameter which might connect to 10 to 50 houses 
some district heating schemes might only be sized to meet the needs of a small village or area of a city in which case only the secondary and tertiary pipes will be needed 
some schemes may be designed to serve only a limited number of dwellings  2050  in which case only tertiary sized pipes are needed 
pros and cons  
district heating has various advantages compared to individual heating systems  usually district heating is more energy efficient  due to simultaneous production of heat and electricity in
generation plants  this has the added benefit of reducing   the larger combustion units also have a more advanced
cleaning than single boiler systems  in the case of surplus heat from industries  district heating systems do not use additional fuel because they recover heat which would otherwise be dispersed to the environment 
district heating requires a long-term financial commitment that fits poorly with a focus on short-term returns on investment  benefits to the community include avoided costs of energy through the use of surplus and wasted heat energy  and reduced investment in individual household or building heating equipment  district heating networks  heat-only boiler stations  and cogeneration plants require high initial capital expenditure and financing  only if considered as long-term investments will these translate into profitable operations for the owners of district heating systems  or combined heat and power plant operators  district heating is less attractive for areas with low population densities  as the investment per household is considerably higher  also it is less attractive in areas of many small buildings  e g  detached houses than in areas with a fewer larger buildings  e g  blocks of flats  because each connection to a single-family house is quite expensive 
individual heating systems can be completely shutdown intermittently according to local heating demand which is not the case with a district heating system 
ownership  monopoly issues and charging structures  
in many cases large combined heat and power district heating schemes are owned by a single entity  this was typically the case in the old eastern bloc countries  however  for the majority of schemes  the ownership of the cogeneration plant is separate from the heat using part 
examples are warsaw which has such split ownership with pgnig termika owning the cogeneration unit  the dalkia polska owning 85  of the heat distribution  the rest of the heat distribution is owned by municipality and workers  similarly all the large chp ch schemes in denmark are of split ownership 
carbon footprint and cost of reduction  
one study shows that district heating with combined heat and power has the potential to be the lowest carbon footprint of any heating system based on combustion  and it rapidly competes with extra insulation  district heating and cooling based on heat sharing networks  seasonal thermal energy storage and electricity from renewable sources powering heat transfer has the potential to be a zero carbon system 
national variation  
since conditions from city to city differ  every district heating system is unique  in addition  nations have different access to primary energy carriers and so they have a different approach on how to address heating markets within their borders 
europe  
since 1954  district heating has been promoted in europe by euroheat   power  they have compiled an analysis of district heating and cooling markets in europe within their
project supported by the   a separate study  entitled heat roadmap europe  has indicated that district heating can reduce the price of energy in the european union between now and 2050  the legal framework in the member states of the
is currently influenced by the eu s  
cogeneration in europe  
the eu has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the   in september 2008 at a hearing of the european parliament s urban lodgment intergroup  energy commissioner andris piebalgs is quoted as saying   security of supply really starts with energy efficiency   energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the european union s cogeneration directive 2004/08 ec  this directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country  the development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances 
as a whole  the european union currently generates 11  of its electricity using cogeneration  saving europe an estimated 35 mtoe per annum  however  there are large differences between the member states  with energy savings ranging from 2  to 60   europe has the three countries with the world s most intensive cogeneration economies  denmark  the netherlands and finland 
other european countries are also making great efforts to increase their efficiency  germany reports that over 50  of the country s total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration  germany set a target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5  of the country s electricity to 25  by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly in  federal ministry of economics and technology    bmwi   germany  august 2007  the uk is also actively supporting district heating  in the light of uk s goal to achieve an 80  reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050  the government had set a target to source at least 15  of government electricity from chp by 2010  other uk measures to encourage chp growth are financial incentives  grant support  a greater regulatory framework  and government leadership and partnership 
according to the iea 2008 modelling of cogeneration expansion for the g8 countries  expansion of cogeneration in france  germany  italy and the uk alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030  this would increase europe s savings from today s 155 twh to 465 twh in 2030  it would also result in a 16  to 29  increase in each country s total cogenerated electricity by 2030 
governments are being assisted in their chp endeavors by organizations like
who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within europe s energy policy  cogen is europe s umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry  users of the technology and promoting its benefits in the eu and the wider europe  the association is backed by the key players in the industry including gas and electricity companies  escos  equipment suppliers  consultancies  national promotion organisations  financial and other service companies 
a 2016 eu energy strategy suggests increased use of district heating 
austria  
the district heating power plant steyr is a renewable combined heat and power plant in which wood chips are used to generate power
the largest district heating system in austria is in
 fernwrme wien   with many smaller systems distributed over the whole country 
district heating in vienna is run by wien energie  in the business year of 2004/2005 a total of 5.163gwh was sold  1.602gwh to 251.224 private apartments and houses and 3.561gwh to 5211 major customers  the three large municipal waste
provide 22  of the total in producing 116gwh electric power and 1.220gwh heat  waste heat from municipal power plants and large industrial plants account for 72  of the total  the remaining 6  is produced by peak heating boilers from fossil fuel  a biomass-fired power plant has produced heat since 2006 
in the rest of austria the newer district heating plants are constructed as biomass plants or as chp-biomass plants like the
or the  
most of the older fossil-fired district heating systems have a   so that it is possible to produce the thermal district heating power only at that time where the electric power price is high 
bulgaria  
bulgaria has district heating in around a dozen towns and cities  the largest system is in the capital   where there are four power plants  two
and two   providing heat to the majority of the city  the system dates back to 1949 
czech republic  
the largest district heating system in the
is in prague owned and operated by prazska teplarenska  serving 265,000 households and selling c  13 pj of heat annually  there are many smaller central heating systems spread around the country 
denmark  
in denmark district heating covers more than 60  of
and   in 2007  80.5  of this heat was produced by
plants  heat recovered from
accounted for 20.4  of the total danish district heat production  in 2013  denmark imported 158,000 ton waste for incineration  most major cities in denmark have big district heating networks  including transmission networks operating with up to 125c and 25 bar pressure and distribution networks operating with up to 95c and between 6 and 10 bar pressure  the largest district heating system in denmark is in the
area operated by ctr i s and veks i s  in central copenhagen  the ctr network serves 275,000 households  90-95  of the area s population  through a network of 54km double district heating distribution pipes providing a peak capacity of 663mw  the consumer price of heat from ctr is approximately 49 permwh plus taxes  2009  
on the island of sams  three straw-fueled district heating plants are used  of which one is owned by the danish energy company nrgi  
finland  
in finland district heating accounts for about 50  of the total heating market  80  of which is produced by combined heat and power plants  over 90  of apartment blocks  more than half of all terraced houses  and the bulk of public buildings and business premises are connected to a district heating network 
is mostly used in the south-east gas pipeline network  imported
is used in areas close to ports  and
is used in northern areas where peat is a natural resource  other renewables  such as wood chips and other paper industry combustible by-products  are also used  as is the energy recovered by the
of   industrial units which generate heat as an industrial by-product may sell otherwise waste heat to the network rather than release it into the environment  excess heat and power from
is a significant source in mill towns  in some towns waste incineration can contribute as much as 8  of the district heating heat requirement 
is 99.98  and disruptions  when they do occur  usually reduce temperatures by only a few degrees 
in helsinki  an underground
next to the president s palace releases excess heat into neighboring homes  producing enough heat to heat approximately 500 large houses 
germany  
in germany district heating has a market share of around 14  in the residential buildings sector  the connected heat load is around 52.729mw  the heat comes mainly from cogeneration plants  83    heat-only boilers supply 16  and 1  is surplus heat from industry  the cogeneration plants use natural gas  42    coal  39    lignite  12   and waste others  7   as fuel 
the largest district heating network is located in berlin whereas the highest diffusion of district heating occurs in
with around 90  market share  in
about 70  of the electricity produced comes from district heating plants 
district heating has rather little legal framework in germany  there is no law on it as most elements of district heating are regulated in governmental or regional orders  there is no governmental support for district heating networks but a law to support cogeneration plants  as in the european union the
will come effective  this law probably needs some adjustment 
greece  
greece has district heating mainly in the province of   central macedonia and the   the largest system is the city of   where there are five power plants   or tps in particular  providing heat to the majority of the largest towns and cities of the area and some villages  the first small installation took place in ptolemaida in 1960  offering heating to
village of
using the tps of ptolemaida  today district heating installations are also available in   ptolemaida      serres and
using nearby power plants  in serres the power plant is a hi-efficiency chp plant using natural gas  while coal is the primary fuel for all other district heating networks

hungary  
according to the 2011 census there were 607,578 dwellings  15.5  of all  in hungary with district heating  mostly
in urban areas  the largest district heating system located in   the municipality-owned ftv zrt    metropolitan teleheating company   provides heat and piped hot water for 238,000 households and 7,000 companies 
iceland

italy  
a cogeneration thermal power plant in
    italy
in italy  district heating is used in some cities                      and now    the district heating of turin is the biggest of the country and it supplies 550.000 people  55  of the whole city population  
norway  
in norway district heating only constitutes approximately 2  of energy needs for heating  this is a very low number compared to similar countries  one of the main reasons district heating has a low penetration in norway is access to cheap hydro-based electricity  and 80  of private electricity consumption goes to heat rooms and water  however  there is district heating in the major cities 
poland  
in 2009  40  of polish households used district heating  most of them in urban areas  heat is provided primarily by
plants  most of which burn hard coal  the largest district heating system is in warsaw  owned and operated by dalkia warszawa  distributing approx  34 pj annually 
romania  
the largest district heating system in
is in   owned and operated by   it distributes approximately 24 pj annually  serving 570000 households  this corresponds to 68  of bucharest s total domestic heat requirements  radet fulfills another 4  through single-building boiler systems  for a total of 72   
russia  
in most russian cities  district-level
plants      produce more than 50  of the nation s electricity and simultaneously provide hot water for neighbouring city blocks  they mostly use
and -powered
for cogeneration of heat  now 
and
designs are beginning to be widely used as well  a -era approach of using very large central stations to heat large districts of a big city or entire small cities is fading away due to inefficiency  since much heat is lost in the piping network because of
and lack of proper  
serbia  
in   district heating is used throughout the main cities  particularly in the capital    the first district heating plant was built in 1961 as a means to provide effective heating to the newly built suburbs of   since then  numerous plants have been built to heat the ever growing city  they use natural gas as fuel  because it has less of an effect on the environment  the district heating system of belgrade possesses 112 heat sources of 2,454mw capacity  over 500km of pipeline  and 4365 connection stations  providing district heating to 240,000 apartments and 7,500 office commercial buildings of total floor area exceeding 17,000,000 square meters   
sweden  
sweden has a long tradition for using teleheating in urban areas  in 2015  about 60  of sweden s houses  private and commercial  were heated by district heating  according to the swedish association of district heating  the city of
reduced its fossil fuel consumption by 30  between 1993 and 2006  and aimed for a 50  reduction by 2010  this was to be achieved largely by way of biomass fired teleheating  another example is the plant of   combining the use of short rotation plantations both for fuel as well as for phytoremediation 
47  of the heat generated in swedish teleheating systems are produced with renewable
sources  as well as 16  in
plants  7  is provided by
and 6  by industrial   the remaining are mostly fossil fuels oil  natural gas    and coal 
because of the law banning traditional   waste is commonly used as a fuel
