renewable energy in the united kingdom can be divided into the generation of renewable electricity  the generation of renewable heat and renewable energy use in the transport sector 
from the mid-1990s
began to contribute to the electricity generated in the   adding to a small
generating capacity  the total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 14.9  of the electricity generated in the united kingdom in 2013  reaching 53.7 twh of electricity generated  in the second quarter of 2015  renewable electricity penetration exceeded 25  and coal generation for the first time 
renewable energy contributions to meeting the uk s 15  target reduction in total energy consumption by 2020  in accordance with the   totalled 5.2  in 2013 as measured in accordance with the methodology set out in the directive  by 2016 provisional calculations show that the figure had risen again to 8.3 per cent of energy consumption  all sources  coming from renewable sources in 2015 
interest in renewable energy in the uk has increased in recent years due to new uk and eu targets for reductions in carbon emissions and the promotion of renewable electricity power generation through commercial incentives such as the
and
and the promotion of renewable heat through the   historically hydroelectric schemes were the largest producers of renewable electricity in the uk  but these have now been surpassed by wind power schemes  for which the uk has large potential resources

history  
renewable heat energy  in the form of biofuels  dates back to 415,000 bp in the uk  uranium series dating and
give evidence to the use of wood fires at the site of beeches pit   
waterwheel technology was imported to the country by the romans  with sites in ikenham and willowford in england being from the 2nd century ad  at the time of the compilation of the
 1086   there were 5,624 watermills in
alone  only 2  of which have not been located by modern archaeological surveys  later research estimates a less conservative number of 6,082  and it has been pointed out that this should be considered a minimum as the northern reaches of england were never properly recorded  in 1300  this number had risen to between 10,000 and 15,000 
windmills first appeared in europe during the   the earliest certain reference to a windmill in europe  assumed to have been of the vertical type  dates from 1185  in the former village of weedley in yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the
overlooking the humber estuary  the first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in july 1887 by scottish academic
to light his holiday home in   scotland 
in 1878 the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at
in  
by   it was used to power a single
in his art gallery 
however  almost all electricity generation thereafter was based on burning coal  in 1964 coal accounted for 88  of electricity generation  and oil was 11   the remainder was mostly supplied by hydroelectric power  which continued to grow its share of electricity generation as coal struggled to meet demand  the world s third
power station  the
in     became fully operational in 1967  the central electricity generating board attempted to experiment with wind energy on the lln peninsula in wales during the 1950s  but this was shelved after local opposition 
renewable energy experienced a turning point in the 1970s with the     growing environmentalism and wind energy development in the
exerting pressure on the government  in 1974  the central policy review staff made the recommendation that the first stage of a full technical and economic appraisal of harnessing wave power for electricity generation should be put in hand at once  wave power was seen to be the future of the nation s energy policy  and solar  wind  and tidal schemes were dismissed as  impractical   nevertheless  an alternative energy research centre was opened in harwell  although it was criticised for favouring nuclear power  by 1978  four wave energy generator prototypes had been designed which were later deemed too expensive  the wave energy programme closed in the same year 
during this period  there was a large increase in installations of
to provide hot water  in 1986  southampton began pumping heat from the geothermal borehole through a district heating network  over the years  several combined heat and power  chp  engines and backup boilers for heating have been added  along with absorption chillers and backupvapour compression machines for cooling 
in 1987 a 3.7mw demonstration wind turbine on
began supplying electricity to homes  the largest in britain at the time  privatisation of the energy sector in 1989 caused direct governmental research funding to cease  two years later the uk s first onshore windfarm was opened in   the farm consists of 10 turbines and produces enough energy for 2,700 homes  this was followed by the uk s first offshore windfarm in north hoyle  wales 
the share of renewables in the country s electricity generation has risen from below 2  in 1990 to 14.9  in 2013  helped by subsidy and falling costs  introduced on 1 april 2002  the
requires all electricity suppliers who supply electricity to end consumers to supply a set portion of their electricity from eligible renewables sources  a proportion that will increase each year until 2015 from a 3  requirement in 2002-2003  via 10.4  in 2010-2012 up to 15.4  by 2015-2016  the uk government announced in the 2006 energy review an additional target of 20  by 2020-21  for each eligible megawatt hour of renewable energy generated  a tradable certificate called a  roc  is issued by  
in 2007  the united kingdom government agreed to an overall european union target of generating 20  of the european union s energy supply from renewable sources by 2020  each european union member state was given its own allocated target  for the united kingdom it is 15   this was formalised in january 2009 with the passage of the eu   as renewable heat and fuel production in the united kingdom are at extremely low bases 
estimates that this will require 3540  of the united kingdom s electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date  to be met largely by 3335 gw of installed wind capacity  the 2008 climate change act consists of a commitment to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 80  by 2050  on 1990 levels  and an intermediate target reduction of 26  by 2020

strike prices  
the  strike price  forms the basis of the contract for difference between the  generator and the low carbon contracts company  lccc   a government-owned company  and guarantees the price per mwh paid to the electricity producer  it is not the same as the
 lcoe  which is a first order estimate of the average cost the producer must receive to break-even 
low-carbon generation sources have agreed  strike prices  in the range 50-79.23 mwh for photovoltaic  80 mwh for energy from waste  79.23-82.5 mwh for onshore wind  and 114.39-119.89 mwh for offshore wind and conversion technologies  all expressed in 2012 prices   these prices are indexed to inflation

wind  
main article 
wind power delivers a growing fraction of the
and at the beginning of january 2015  wind power in the united kingdom consisted of 6,546 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of just under 12   7,950
of onshore capacity and 4,049 megawatts of offshore capacity  the united kingdom is ranked as the world s sixth largest producer of wind power  having overtaken france and italy in 2012  polling of public opinion consistently shows strong support for wind power in the uk  with nearly three quarters of the population agreeing with its use  even for people living near onshore wind turbines  wind power is expected to continue growing in the uk for the foreseeable future 
estimates that more than 2gw of capacity will be deployed per year for the next five years  within the uk  wind power is the second largest source of renewable energy after  
2010 saw the completion of some significant projects in the uk wind industry with the  
and
offshore wind farms coming on stream  over 1.1gw of new wind power capacity was brought online during 2010  a 3  increase on 2009  there was a 38  drop in onshore installations to 503mw compared with 815mw in 2009 but there was a 230  increase in offshore installations with 653mw installed  compared with 285mw in 2009  
ocean power  
pb150 powerbuoy with peak-rated power output of 150 kw 
main article 
the
wave power device
due to the
location of the uk  the country has great potential for generating electricity from
and  
to date  wave and tidal power have received very little money for development and consequently have not yet been exploited on a significant commercial basis due to doubts over their economic viability in the uk  the european marine energy centre in orkney operates a grid connected wave power scheme at billia croo outside stromness and a grid connected tidal test side in a narrow channel between the westray firth and stronsay firth 
funding for the uk s first
was announced by then
in february 2007  it will be the world s largest  with a capacity of 3 mw generated by four
machines and a cost of over 4 million   in the south of scotland investigations have taken place into a
scheme involving the construction of a solway barage  possibly located south of  
a
project to harness   using the pb150
has been completed by

biofuels  
main article 
and
   has already been exploited in some areas  in 2004 it provided 129.3 gwh  up 690  from 1990 levels   and was the uk s leading renewable energy source  representing 39.4  of all renewable energy produced  including hydro   the uk has committed to a target of 10.3  of renewable energy in transport to comply with the
of the european union but has
to meet this target 
other

and   the production of biofuels for export has in some cases resulted in significant ecological damage  including the clearing of   in 2004 biofuels provided 105.9 gwh  38  of it   this represented an increase of 500  from 1990 
solar  
solar panels on the
development in the
main article 
at the end of 2011  there were 230,000 solar power projects in the united kingdom  with a total installed generating capacity of 750
 mw   by february 2012 the installed capacity had reached 1,000 mw 
use has increased very rapidly in recent years  albeit from a small base  as a result of reductions in the cost of
 pv  panels  and the introduction of a
 fit  subsidy in april 2010  in 2012  the government said that 4 million homes across the uk will be powered by the sun within eight years  representing 22,000 mw of installed solar power capacity by 2020 
hydroelectric  
main article 
the
lower reservoir  a 1,800 mw pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme  in north wales  and the largest hydroelectric power station in the uk
as of 2012 
stations in the united kingdom accounted for 1.67 gw of installed electrical generating capacity  being 1.9  of the uk s total generating capacity and 14  of uk s
generating capacity  annual electricity production from such schemes is approximately 5,700 gwh  being about 1.5  of the uk s total electricity production 
there are also
power stations in the uk  these power stations are net consumers of electrical energy however they contribute to balancing the grid  which can facilitate renewable generation elsewhere  for example by  soaking up  surplus renewable output at off-peak times and release the energy when it is required 
geothermal power  
main article 
investigations into the exploitation of   prompted by the   were abandoned as fuel prices fell  only one scheme is operational  in   in 2004 it was announced that a further scheme would be built to heat the uk s first geothermal energy
near    
microgeneration  
technologies are seen as having considerable potential by the government  however  the microgeneration strategy launched in march 2006 was seen as a disappointment by many commentators  microgeneration involves the local production of electricity by homes and businesses from low-energy sources including small scale   and
installations  the
is expected to boost the number of microgeneration installations  however  funding for grants under the
is proving insufficient to meet demand with funds for march 2007 being spent in 75 minutes  fits  feed-in-tariffs  aka  clean energy cashback   were introduced from 1 april 2010 to support microgeneration of electricity  the
was introduced from 28 november 2011 to support microgeneration of heat from   solar thermal panels and biomass boilers  but only for non-domestic dwellings  the government has plans to extend the rhi to domestic dwellings in 2013  the delay of introducing the rhi for renewable heat long after the subsidy for renewable electricity was introduced has dealt a savage blow to the renewable heat industries 
community energy systems  
  pioneered by
borough council  provide an integrated approach to using cogeneration  renewables and other technologies to provide sustainable energy supplies to an urban community  it is expected that the same approach will be developed in other towns and cities  including  
based in
are active in developing community-owned and led initiatives in  
energy positive house was built in wales with 120,000 in july 2015  the future price is estimated as 100,000  the annual export of energy of building is higher than its own demand
