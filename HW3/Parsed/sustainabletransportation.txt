aspects of sustainable transport 
sustainable transport
sustainable transport refers to the broad subject of
that is
in the senses of social  environmental and climate impacts and the ability to  in the global scope  supply the source energy indefinitely  components for evaluating sustainability include the particular
used for road  water or air transport  the source of   and the
used to accommodate the transport         
and terminals   another component for evaluation is
for transporting liquid or gas materials  transport operations and
as well as
are also involved in evaluation  transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the
and
impacts of the system 
short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in
and
while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as
and use of other   the entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to
and optimization 
sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental  social and economic
of the communities they serve  transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections  and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility  with poor households benefiting greatly from
transport options  the advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental  social and economic costs that transport systems pose 
transport systems have significant impacts on the environment  accounting for between 20  and 25  of world energy consumption and
emissions  the majority of the emissions  almost 97   came from direct burning of fossil fuels  greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector  road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and  
the
estimates that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided  particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon  a component of particulate matter  which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change  the links between
and particulate matter make
transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local levelboth by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change  and by improving public health through better  
the social costs of transport include road crashes  air pollution  physical inactivity  time taken away from the
while
and vulnerability to   many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars 
imposes economic costs by wasting people s time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services 
traditional
aims to improve mobility  especially for vehicles  and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts  but the real purpose of transport is access - to work  education  goods and services  friends and family - and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts  and managing traffic congestion  communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider programme of creating more vibrant  livable

definition  
the term sustainable transport came into use as a logical follow-on from   and is used to describe modes of transport  and systems of transport planning  which are consistent with wider concerns of   there are many definitions of the sustainable transport  and of the related terms sustainable transportation and sustainable mobility  one such definition  from the
council of ministers of transport  defines a sustainable transportation system as one that 
allows the basic access and development needs of individuals  companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and   and promotes equity within and between successive generations 
is affordable  operates fairly and efficiently  offers a choice of transport mode  and supports a competitive economy  as well as balanced regional development 
limits emissions and waste within the planets ability to absorb them  uses renewable resources at or below their rates of generation  and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes  while minimizing the impact on the use of land and the generation of noise 
sustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions  a
involves production  use and post-use considerations  a
is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency 
history  
an 1889 japanese print shows various forms of transportation
most of the tools and concepts of sustainable transport were developed before the phrase was coined  walking  the first mode of transport  is also the most sustainable  public transport dates back at least as far as the invention of the public bus by
in 1662  the first
began operation in 1807 and the
in 1825 
date from the 1860s  these were the only personal transport choices available to most people in western countries prior to   and remain the only options for most people in the developing world  freight was moved by human power  animal power or rail 
the post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods  the number of road vehicles in britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979  with similar trends in other western nations  most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways  which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity  transport planning became a branch of
and identified
as a pivotal change from  predict and provide  toward a sustainable approach incorporating
and   public investment in transit  walking and cycling declined dramatically in the united states  great britain and australia  although this did not occur to the same extent in canada or mainland europe 
concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the
and the   the high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel 
transport innovations dating from this period include   citywide
systems and  
implemented
in the late 1970s  and
began implementing its
system in the early 1980s 
relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from 19802000  both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances  and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing  distant from shops and from workplaces  now referred to as   trends in freight logistics  including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for
deliveries  meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic 
at the same time  the academic foundations of the  predict and provide  approach to transport were being questioned  notably by
in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid-1980s 
the british government s white paper on transport marked a change in direction for transport planning in the uk  in the introduction to the white paper  prime minister
stated that
we recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face  it would be environmentally irresponsible - and would not work 
a companion document to the white paper called  smarter choices  researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across britain  and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20  
a similar study by the united states federal highway administration  was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy

transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases  responsible for 23  of world energy-related ghg emissions in 2004  with about three quarters coming from road vehicles  currently 95  of transport energy comes from petroleum  energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles  and is
in transport infrastructure including roads  bridges and railways 
the first historical attempts of evaluating the life cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to   after decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the von karman model  dewulf and van langenhove have introduced an model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis  chester and orwath  have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure  recently trancossi has started a long term research activity for energy optimization of transport vehicles by   this activity has allowed producing a preliminary design method that applies to road vehicles  and has improved the
method by de wulf with a more detailed evaluation of the losses and has produced today largest database of calculated data of energy efficiency and emissions  he has also introduced a method for evaluating the energy lost for moving the vehicle and the payload  the robustness of the data have been verified by mittal and singh  centre for public policy of indian institute of management bangalore 
the environmental impacts of transport can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles  sustainable styles of driving  reducing the friction of tires  encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles  improving the walking and cycling environment in cities  and by enhancing the role of public transport  especially electric rail 
are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles  although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its
this may not be the case 
technology has the potential to reduce transport co2 emissions  depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity  the primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries  coal  gas  oil  mean that until world electricity production changes substantially  private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of co2 than petrol equivalent vehicles  the online electric vehicle  olev   developed by the korea advanced institute of science and technology  kaist   is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving  thus removing the need to stop at a charging station  the city of gumi in south korea runs a 24km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100kw  136 horsepower  electricity at an 85  maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface  at that power  only a few sections of the road need embedded cables    which use an

in 2007  but the
has warned that the success of biofuels in brazil is due to specific local circumstances  internationally  biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions  at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures 
in practice there is a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option  green vehicles are more   but only in comparison with standard vehicles  and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes  well-patronised
networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles  and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles  green public transport vehicles including electric trains  trams and

cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences  linked to radical drops in     and   in many cases  streets became void of life  stores  schools  government centers and libraries moved away from central cities  and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services  as schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic  the number of cars on us roads between 7 15 and 8 15a m  increases 30  during the school year

in 1939  the
included a model of an imagined city  built around a car-based transport system  in this  greater and better world of tomorrow   residential  commercial and industrial areas were separated  and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways  these ideas captured the popular imagination  and are credited with influencing city planning from the 1940s to the 1970s

the popularity of the car in the post-war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities  there was some opposition to these changes at the time  the writings of   in particular
provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation  and a record of community efforts to resist these changes  lewis mumford asked  is the city for cars or for people  
documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in  the view from the road   1964  and in the uk 
first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in 1971  despite these notes of caution  trends in car ownership  car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period 
mainstream transport planning in europe has  by contrast  never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility  for example  the
transport structure scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met  if the contribution to societal welfare is positive   and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic  some cities outside europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to   notably

there are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities  an average u s  urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for private transport than a chinese urban resident  and almost four times as much as a european urban dweller  these differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking  cycling  and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including
and urban design

has also been questioned  within the united states  residents of
cities make more frequent and longer car trips  while residents of traditional urban neighbourhoods make a similar number of trips  but travel shorter distances and walk  cycle and use transit more often  it has been calculated that new york residents save  19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average american  a less car intensive means of urban transport is   which is becoming popular in north america and europe  and according to   carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles  car sharing has also begun in the developing world  where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries  companies like
in india  ehi in china  and carrot in mexico  are bringing car-sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car-related pollution  ameliorate traffic  and expand the number of people who have access to cars

community and grassroots action  
sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement  albeit one which is now recognised as of citywide  national and international significance 
whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns  over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues  and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations  including the fast-growing population of older citizens  many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise  pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own  or cannot drive cars  and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden 
an organization called
started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the united states encouraging people to
by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage  posts and photography  ride-sharing reduces individual s carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars 
recent trends  
car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century  but trends since 2000 have been more complex 
have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the usa  britain and australia  in 2008  global oil consumption fell by 0.8  overall  with significant declines in consumption in north america  western europe  and parts of asia  other factors affecting a decline in driving  at least in america  include the retirement of
who now drive less  preference for other travel modes  such as transit  by younger age cohorts  the   and the rising use of technology  internet  mobile devices  which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive 
criticism  
the term green transport is often used as a
marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability  such claims can be legally challenged  for instance norway s
has targeted
who claim that their cars are  green    clean  or  environmentally friendly   manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words  the
 accc  describes green claims on products as very vague  inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim  which risks misleading them  in 2008 the accc forced a car retailer to stop its green marketing of saab cars  which was found by the australian federal court as misleading
