this is a list of energy storage projects worldwide  many individual
projects augment
by capturing excess electrical energy during periods of low demand and storing it in other forms until needed on an   the energy is later converted back to its electrical form and returned to the grid as needed 
another energy storage method is the consumption of surplus or low-cost energy  typically during night time  for conversion into resources such as hot water  cool water or ice  which is then used for heating or cooling at other times when electricity is in higher demand and at greater cost per kilowatt hour  kwh   such
is often employed at end-user sites such as large buildings  and also as part of   thus  shifting  energy consumption to other times for better balancing of supply and demand

the system will have built-in sensing components that can determine frequency and voltage characteristics of the grid and can override the grid signal to manage the amount of electricity discharged  the flywheel stores energy in a spinning rotor that is connected to an electric motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy  to recover the energy the motor is electrically reversed and used as a generator to slow down the flywheel converting the mechanical energy back into electrical energy 
amber kinetics will improve the traditional flywheel system by engineering breakthroughs in three areas  resulting in higher efficiency and radically reduced cost    low-cost rotor  and high-efficiency motor generator  this technology can also be used to optimize existing infrastructure pdfs
