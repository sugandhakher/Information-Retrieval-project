waste vegetable oil which has been filtered 
can be used as an
in
and in
burners  when vegetable oil is used directly as a fuel  in either modified or unmodified equipment  it is referred to as straight vegetable oil  svo  or pure plant oil  ppo   conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the
of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper
of the fuel  this prevents incomplete combustion  which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of   straight vegetable oil can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into

history  
rudolf diesel
was the father of the engine which bears his name  his first attempts were to design an engine to run on coal dust  but later designed his engine to run on vegetable oil  the idea  he hoped  would make his engines more attractive to farmers having a source of fuel readily available  in a 1912 presentation to the british   he cited a number of efforts in this area and remarked   the fact that fat oils from vegetable sources can be used may seem insignificant today  but such oils may perhaps become in course of time of the same importance as some natural mineral oils and the tar products are now  
periodic petroleum shortages spurred research into vegetable oil as a diesel substitute during the 1930s and 1940s  and again in the 1970s and early 1980s when straight vegetable oil enjoyed its highest level of scientific interest  the 1970s also saw the formation of the first commercial enterprise to allow consumers to run straight

to fuel their vehicles 
application and usability  
modified fuel systems  
most diesel car engines are suitable for the use of straight vegetable oil  svo   also commonly called pure plant oil  ppo   with certain modifications  principally  the
and
of the svo ppo must be reduced by preheating it  typically by using waste heat from the engine or electricity  otherwise poor atomization  incomplete combustion and
may result  one common solution is to add a
and an additional fuel tank for the petrodiesel or biodiesel blend and to switch between this additional tank and the main tank of svo ppo  the engine is started on diesel  switched over to vegetable oil as soon as it is warmed up and switched back to diesel shortly before being switched off to ensure that no vegetable oil remains in the engine or fuel lines when it is started from cold again  in colder climates it is often necessary to heat the vegetable oil fuel lines and tank as it can become very viscous and even solidify 
single tank conversions have been developed  largely in germany  which have been used throughout europe  these conversions are designed to provide reliable operation with rapeseed oil that meets the german rapeseed oil fuel standard
51605  modifications to the engines cold start regime assist combustion on start up and during the engine warm up phase  suitably modified
 idi  engines have proven to be operable with 100  ppo down to temperatures of 10c  14f  
 di  engines generally have to be preheated with a
or diesel fired heater  the exception is the vw tdi    engine for which a number of german companies offer single tank conversions  for long term durability it has been found necessary to increase the oil change frequency and to pay increased attention to engine maintenance 
unmodified indirect injection engines  
many cars powered by
engines supplied by in-line injection pumps  or mechanical
injection pumps are capable of running on pure svo ppo in all but winter temperatures  indirect injection
vehicles with in-line injection pumps and cars featuring the
engine tend to perform reasonably  especially as the latter is normally equipped with a coolant heated   engine reliability would depend on the condition of the engine  attention to maintenance of the engine  particularly of the fuel injectors  cooling system and glow plugs will help to provide longevity  ideally the engine would be converted 
vegetable oil blending  
the relatively high kinematic viscosity of vegetable oils must be reduced to make them compatible with conventional compression-ignition engines and fuel systems 
blending is a low-cost and easy-to-adapt technology that reduces viscosity by diluting the vegetable oil with a low-molecular-weight   this blending  or  cutting   has been done with diesel fuel  kerosene  and gasoline  amongst others  however  opinions vary as to the efficacy of this  noted problems include higher rates of wear and failure in fuel pumps and piston rings when using blends 
home heating  
main article 
when liquid fuels made from biomass are used for energy purposes other than transport  they are called bioliquids 
with often minimal modification  most residential furnaces and boilers that are designed to burn no  2 heating oil can be made to burn either biodiesel or filtered  preheated waste vegetable oil  wvo   if cleaned at home by the consumer  wvo can result in considerable savings  many restaurants will receive a minimal amount for their used cooking oil  and processing to biodiesel is fairly simple and inexpensive  burning filtered wvo directly is somewhat more problematic  since it is much more viscous  nonetheless  its burning can be accomplished with suitable preheating  wvo can thus be an economical heating option for those with the necessary mechanical and experimental aptitude 
combined heat and power  
a number of companies offer
generators optimized to run on plant oils where the waste engine heat is recovered for heating 
properties  
the main form of svo ppo used in the uk is
oil  also known as
oil  primarily in the united states and canada  which has a freezing point of 10c  14f     however the use of sunflower oil  which gels at around 12c  10f   is currently being investigated as a means of improving cold weather starting  unfortunately oils with lower gelling points tend to be less saturated  leading to a higher   and
more easily in the presence of atmospheric oxygen 
material compatibility  
polymerization also has been consequentially linked to catastrophic component failures such as injection pump shaft seizure and breakage  injector tip failure leading to various and or combustion chamber components damaged  most metallurgical problems such as corrosion and electrolysis are related to water based contamination or poor choices of plumbing  such as copper or zinc  which can cause gelling- even with petroleum based fuels 
temperature effects  
some pacific island nations are using
as fuel to reduce their expenses and their dependence on imported fuels while helping stabilize the coconut oil market  coconut oil is only usable where temperatures do not drop below 17 degrees celsius  63 degrees fahrenheit   unless two-tank svo ppo kits or other tank-heating accessories  etc  are used  fortunately  the same techniques developed to use  for example  canola and other oils in cold climates can be implemented to make coconut oil usable in temperatures lower than 17 degrees celsius  63 degrees fahrenheit 
availability  
recycled vegetable oil  
main article 
recycled vegetable oil  also termed used vegetable oil  uvo   waste vegetable oil  wvo   used cooking oil  uco   or
 in
exchange   is recovered from businesses and industry that use the oil for cooking 
as of 2000  the
was producing in excess of 11 billion liters  2.9 billion u s  gallons  of recycled vegetable oil annually  mainly from industrial
in
processing plants 
factories and   if all those 11 billion liters could be
and used to replace the energy equivalent amount of petroleum  an ideal case   almost 1  of us oil consumption could be offset  use of used vegetable oil as a direct fuel competes with some
of the   which has effects on its price as a fuel and increases its cost as an input to the other uses as well 
virgin vegetable oil  
virgin vegetable oil  also termed pure plant oil or straight vegetable oil  is extracted from plants solely for use as fuel  in contrast to used vegetable oil  is not a byproduct of other industries  and thus its prospects for use as fuel are not limited by the capacities of other industries    production of vegetable oils for use as fuels is theoretically limited only by the agricultural capacity of a given economy  however  doing so detracts from the supply of other uses of pure vegetable oil 
legal implications  
taxation of fuel  
taxation on svo ppo as a road fuel varies from country to country  and it is possible the revenue departments in many countries are even unaware of its use  or feel it too insignificant to legislate  germany used to have 0  taxation  resulting in it being a leader in most developments of the fuel use  however svo ppo as a road fuel began to be taxed at 0,09  liter from 1 january 2008 in germany  with incremental rises up to 0,45  liter by 2012  however  in australia it has become illegal to produce any fuel if it is to be sold unless a license to do so is granted by the federal government  this is a chargeable offense with a fine of up to 20,000 dollars but this bracket may alter circumstantially  also a jail term may result if offenders are aware of the illegality of selling the fuel
