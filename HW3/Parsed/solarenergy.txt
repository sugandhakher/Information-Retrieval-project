the potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography  time variation  cloud cover  and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire 
geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the
have a greater amount of solar radiation  however  the use of
that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator  time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the earth for
to absorb  this limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day 
can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells 
in addition  land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels  roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells  as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way  other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established 
solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture  convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world  mostly depending on distance from the equator  although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends  all renewable energies  other than
and   derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the sun 
active solar techniques use photovoltaics      pumps  and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs  passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties  designing spaces that naturally circulate air  and referencing the position of a building to the sun  active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered
technologies  while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies 
in 2000  the   un department of economic and social affairs  and
published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation  cloud cover  and the land that is usable by humans  the estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,57549,837ej per year  see table below

early commercial adaptation
1917 patent drawing of shuman s solar collector
in 1897    a u s  inventor  engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether  which has a lower boiling point than water  and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine  in 1908 shuman formed the sun power company with the intent of building larger solar power plants  he  along with his technical advisor a s e  ackermann and british physicist sir   developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes  increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether  shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water  enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 
shuman built the worlds first
in     between 1912 and 1913  his plant used
to power a 4552 kilowatts  6070  engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres  4,800impgal  5,800usgal  of water per minute from the
to adjacent cotton fields  although the outbreak of
and the discovery of
in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy  shumans vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy  in 1916 shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy s utilization  saying 
we have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun

solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water  in low geographical latitudes  below 40degrees  from 60 to 70  of the domestic hot water use with temperatures up to 60c can be provided by solar heating systems  the most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors  44   and glazed flat plate collectors  34   generally used for domestic hot water  and unglazed plastic collectors  21   used mainly to heat swimming pools 
as of 2007  the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately 154

thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heatheat from the sun in the case of solar energy  common thermal mass materials include stone  cement and water  historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night  however  they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well  the size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate  daylighting and shading conditions  when properly incorporated  thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment 
a solar chimney  or thermal chimney  in this context  is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building  as the chimney warms  the air inside is heated causing an
that pulls air through the building  performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses 
trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling  when planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere  their leaves provide shade during the summer  while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter  since bare  leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation  there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating  in climates with significant heating loads  deciduous trees should not be planted on the equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability  they can  however  be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain

solar cookers use sunlight for cooking  drying and   they can be grouped into three broad categories  box cookers  panel cookers and reflector cookers  the simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by
in 1767  a basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid  it can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90150c  194302f   panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers  reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries  dish  trough  fresnel mirrors  to focus light on a cooking container  these cookers reach temperatures of 315c  599f  and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the sun
