etymology
main article 
it is likely that the word  brazil  comes from the portuguese word for   a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast  in portuguese  brazilwood is called pau-brasil  with the word brasil commonly given the etymology  red like an ember   formed from latin brasa   ember   and the suffix -il  from -iculum or -ilium   as brazilwood produces a deep red dye  it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil  throughout the 16th century  massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by
 mostly   along the brazilian coast  who sold the timber to european traders  mostly portuguese  but also french  in return for assorted european consumer goods 
the official portuguese name of the land  in original portuguese records  was the  land of the holy cross   terra da santa cruz   but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the  land of brazil   terra do brasil  on account of the brazilwood trade  the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name  early sailors sometimes also called it the  land of parrots   terra di papaga  
in the   an official language of   brazil is called  pindorama   this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region  meaning  land of the palm trees
