background and brief history  
early thorium-based    nuclear reactor at
in the 1960s
after world war ii  uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity  these were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons  during that period  the government of the united states also built
using u-233 fuel  the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons  the msre reactor  built at   operated
for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969  in 1968  nobel laureate and discoverer of     publicly announced to the   of which he was chairman  that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested 
in 1973  however  the us government shut down all thorium-related nuclear researchwhich had by then been ongoing for approximately twenty years at   the reasons were that uranium breeder reactors were more efficient  the research was proven  and byproducts could be used to make nuclear weapons  in moir and tellers opinion  the decision to stop development of thorium reactors  at least as a backup option  was an excusable mistake 
science writer richard martin states that nuclear physicist   who was director at oak ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor  lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors  weinberg himself recalls this period 
 congressman 
was clearly exasperated with me  and he finally blurted out   alvin  if you are concerned about the safety of reactors  then i think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy   i was speechless  but it was apparent to me that my style  my attitude  and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the aec 
martin explains that weinberg s unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire 
weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor  one that would have zero risk of meltdown        his team built a working reactor         and he spent the rest of his 18-year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nations atomic power effort  he failed  uranium reactors had already been established  and   de facto head of the us nuclear program  wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs  increasingly shunted aside  weinberg was finally forced out in 1973 
despite the documented history of thorium nuclear power  many of todays nuclear experts were nonetheless unaware of it  according to    most peopleincluding scientistshave hardly heard of the heavy-metal element and know little about it      noting a comment by a conference attendee that  it s possible to have a ph d  in nuclear reactor technology and not know about thorium energy   nuclear physicist   for one  first learned of it in 2012 
it came as a surprise to me to learn recently that such an alternative has been available to us since world war ii  but not pursued because it lacked weapons applications 
others  including former
scientist and thorium expert   agree that  thorium was the alternative path that was not taken    2 according to sorensen  during a documentary interview  he states that if the us had not discontinued its research in 1974 it could have  probably achieved energy independence by around 2000  
possible benefits  
the
explains some of the possible benefits
the thorium fuel cycle offers enormous energy security benefits in the long-term  due to its potential for being a self-sustaining fuel without the need for fast neutron reactors  it is therefore an important and potentially viable technology that seems able to contribute to building credible  long-term nuclear energy scenarios 
moir and teller agree  noting that the possible advantages of thorium include  utilization of an abundant fuel  inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use  together with good economics and safety features    thorium is considered the  most abundant  most readily available  cleanest  and safest energy source on earth   adds science writer richard martin  7
thorium is three times as abundant as uranium and nearly as abundant as lead and gallium in the earth s crust  the
estimates  there is enough thorium in the united states alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 1,000 years    america has buried tons as a by-product of rare earth metals mining   notes evans-pritchard  almost all thorium is
th-232  compared to uranium that is composed of 99.3  fertile u-238 and 0.7  more valuable fissile u-235 
it is difficult to make a practical nuclear bomb from a thorium reactor s byproducts  according to   designer of the world s first full-scale atomic electric power plant   a thorium reactor s plutonium production rate would be less than 2 percent of that of a standard reactor  and the plutonium s isotopic content would make it unsuitable for a nuclear detonation   11 several uranium-233 bombs have been tested  but the presence of
tended to  poison  the uranium-233 in two ways 
from the uranium-232 made the material difficult to handle  and the uranium-233 led to possible pre-detonation  separating the uranium-232 from the uranium-233 proved very difficult  although newer
techniques could facilitate that process 
there is much less nuclear wasteup to two orders of magnitude less  states moir and teller  eliminating the need for large-scale or long-term storage  13  chinese scientists claim that hazardous waste will be a thousand times less than with uranium   the radioactivity of the resulting waste also drops down to safe levels after just a few hundred years  compared to tens of thousands of years needed for current nuclear waste to cool off 
according to moir and teller   once started up  it  needs no other fuel except thorium because it makes most or all of its own fuel   this only applies to breeding reactors  that produce at least as much fissile material as they consume  other reactors require additional fissile material  such as uranium-235 or plutonium 
thorium fuel cycle is a potential way to produce long term nuclear energy with low radio-toxicity waste  in addition  the transition to thorium could be done through the incineration of weapons grade plutonium  wpu  or civilian plutonium 
since all natural thorium can be used as fuel no expensive fuel enrichment is needed  however the same is true for u-238 as fertile fuel in the uranium-plutonium cycle 
comparing the amount of thorium needed with coal  nobel laureate
of    european organization for nuclear research   estimates that one ton of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium  or 3,500,000 tons of coal  coal  makes up 42  of us electrical power generation and 65  in china 
liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof  a plug at the bottom of the reactor melts in the event of a power failure or if temperatures exceed a set limit  draining the fuel into an underground tank for safe storage 
mining thorium is safer and more efficient than mining uranium  thorium s ore monazite generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore  this makes thorium a more cost efficient and less environmentally damaging fuel source  thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining  as the mine is an open pit which requires no ventilation  unlike underground uranium mines  where
levels can be potentially harmful 
summarizing some of the potential benefits  martin offers his general opinion   thorium could provide a clean and effectively limitless source of power while allaying all public concernweapons proliferation  radioactive pollution  toxic waste  and fuel that is both costly and complicated to process  13 from an economics viewpoint  uk business editor
has suggested that  obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium   suggesting a  new    and adding   if it works  manhattan ii could restore american optimism and strategic leadership at a stroke   moir and teller estimated in 2004 that the cost for their recommended prototype would be  well under  1 billion with operation costs likely on the order of  100 million per year   and as a result a  large-scale nuclear power plan  usable by many countries could be set up within a decade 
possible disadvantages  
some experts note possible specific disadvantages of thorium nuclear power 
breeding in a thermal neutron spectrum is slow and requires extensive   the feasibility of reprocessing is still open 
significant and expensive testing  analysis and licensing work is first required  requiring business and government support  according to a 2012 report by the   about using thorium fuel with existing water-cooled reactors  it would  require too great an investment and provide no clear payoff   noting that  from the utilities point of view  the only legitimate driver capable of motivating pursuit of thorium is economics  
there is a higher cost of fuel fabrication and reprocessing than in plants using traditional solid fuel rods 
thorium  when being irradiated for use in reactors  will make uranium-232  which is very dangerous due to the gamma rays it emits  this irradiation process may be altered slightly by removing protactinium-233  the irradiation would then make uranium-233 in lieu of uranium-232  which can be used in nuclear weapons to make thorium into a dual purpose fuel 
current projects  
research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors  primarily the
 lftr  
design  has been or is now being done in the united states  united kingdom  germany    india  china  france  the   japan  russia  canada  israel  and the   conferences with experts from as many as 32 countries are held  including one by the
   in 2013  which focuses on thorium as an alternative nuclear technology without requiring production of nuclear waste  recognized experts  such as   former head of the   calls for expanded support of new nuclear power technology  and states   the thorium option offers the world not only a new sustainable supply of fuel for nuclear power but also one that makes better use of the fuel s energy content  
canada  
are capable of using thorium  and thorium power canada has  in 2013  planned and proposed developing thorium power projects for chile and indonesia 
the proposed 10 mw demonstration reactor in
could be used to power a 20 million litre day   all land and regulatory approvals are currently in process 
thorium power canada s proposal for the development of a 25 mw
reactor in
is meant to be a  demonstration power project  which could provide electrical power to the countrys power grid 
china  
at the 2011 annual conference of the   it was announced that  china has initiated a research and development project in thorium
technology   in addition  dr    son of china s former leader   led a thorium delegation in non-disclosure talks at   tennessee  and by late 2013 china had officially partnered with oak ridge to aid china in its own development  the
notes that the
in january 2011 announced its r d program   claiming to have the world s largest national effort on it  hoping to obtain full
rights on the technology   according to martin   china has made clear its intention to go it alone   adding that china already has a monopoly over most of the world s   157
in march 2014  with their reliance on coal-fired power having become a major cause of their current  smog crisis   they reduced their original goal of creating a working reactor from 25 years down to 10   in the past  the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage  now they are more interested because of smog   said professor li zhong  a scientist working on the project   this is definitely a race   he added 
in early 2012  it was reported that china  using components produced by the west and russia  planned to build two prototype thorium
by 2015  and had budgeted the project at  400 million and requiring 400 workers   china also finalized an agreement with a canadian nuclear technology company to develop improved
reactors using thorium and uranium as a fuel 
germany  
the german
was a prototype commercial power station using thorium as fertile and highly enriched u-235 as fissile fuel  though named thorium high temperature reactor  mostly u-235 was fissioned  the thtr-300 was a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor with a
core consisting of approximately 670,000 spherical fuel compacts each 6 centimetres  2.4 in  in diameter with particles of uranium-235 and thorium-232 fuel embedded in a graphite matrix  it fed power to germany s grid for 432 days in the late 1980s  before it was shut down for cost  mechanical and other reasons 
india  
india has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world  with comparatively poor quantities of uranium  india has projected meeting as much as 30  of its electrical demands through thorium by 2050 
in february 2014 
 barc   in mumbai  india  presented their latest design for a  next-generation nuclear reactor  that will burn thorium as its fuel ore  once built  with a target date of 2016  they estimate that the reactor could function without an operator for 120 days 
according to dr r k sinha  chairman of their atomic energy commission   this will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels  mostly imported  and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change   because of its inherent safety  they expect that similar designs could be set up  within  populated cities  like mumbai or delhi 
india s government is also developing up to 62  mostly thorium reactors  which it expects to be operational by 2025  it is the  only country in the world with a detailed  funded  government-approved plan  to focus on thorium-based nuclear power  the country currently gets under 2  of its electricity from nuclear power  with the rest coming from coal  60    hydroelectricity  16    other renewable sources  12   and natural gas  9    it expects to produce around 25  of its electricity from nuclear power  in 2009 the chairman of the indian atomic energy commission said that india has a  long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources  
in late june 2012  india announced that their  first commercial fast reactor  was near completion making india the most advanced country in thorium research   we have huge reserves of thorium  the challenge is to develop technology for converting this to fissile material   stated their former chairman of india s atomic energy commission  that vision of using thorium in place of uranium was set out in the 1950s by physicist   india s first commercial fast breeder reactor  the 500 mwe
 pfbr   is approaching completion at the      
as of july 2013 the major equipment of the pfbr had been erected and the loading of  dummy  fuels in peripheral locations was in progress  the reactor was expected to go critical by september 2014  the centre had sanctioned rs  5,677
for building the pfbr and we will definitely build the reactor within that amount  mr  kumar asserted  the original cost of the project was rs  3,492 crore  revised to rs  5,677 crore  electricity generated from the pfbr would be sold to the state electricity boards at rs  4.44 a unit  bhavini builds
in india 
india s 300 mwe
 pressurized heavy water reactor  began construction     in 2011    the design envisages a start up with reactor grade plutonium that will breed u-233 from th-232  thereafter thorium is to be the only fuel 
by nov 2015 the pfbr was built and expected to delays have since postponed the commissioning  criticality   of the pfbr to sept 2016  but india s commitment to long-term nuclear energy production is underscored by the approval in 2015 of ten new sites for reactors of unspecified types  though procurement of primary fissile material  preferably plutonium  may be problematic due to india s low uranium reserves and capacity for production 
israel  
in may 2010  researchers from
in israel and
in new york began to collaborate on the development of thorium reactors  aimed at being self-sustaining   meaning one that will produce and consume about the same amounts of fuel   which is not possible with uranium in a light water reactor 
japan  
in june 2012  japan utility
wrote that they regard thorium as  one of future possible energy resources  
norway  
in late 2012  norway s privately owned thor energy  in collaboration with the government and   announced a four-year trial using thorium in an existing nuclear reactor   in 2013 
purchased patents from nobel prize winning physicist
for the design of a proton accelerator-based thorium nuclear power plant 
united kingdom  
in britain  one organisation promoting or examining research on thorium-based nuclear plants is   house of lords member
is promoting thorium  calling it the forgotten fuel that could alter britains energy plans  however  in 2010  the uks
 nnl  concluded that for the short to medium term      the thorium fuel cycle does not currently have a role to play   in that it is  technically immature  and would require a significant financial investment and risk without clear benefits   and concluded that the benefits have been  overstated  
uk considers research into it as  useful  as a fallback option 
united states  
in its january 2012 report to the   the blue ribbon commission on america s future notes that a  molten-salt reactor using thorium  has  also been proposed   that same month it was reported that the
is  quietly collaborating with china  on thorium-based nuclear power designs using an  
some experts and politicians want thorium to be  the pillar of the u s  nuclear future   senators

have supported using  250 million in federal research funds to revive
research  in 2009  congressman
unsuccessfully attempted to secure funding for research and development of a -sized reactor  reactor of a size to power a destroyer  using thorium-based liquid fuel 
  chief designer of the worlds second full-scale atomic electric power plant in   founded a joint us and russian project in 1997 to create a thorium-based reactor  considered a  creative breakthrough   in 1992  while a resident professor in   israel  he founded the us company  thorium power ltd   near washington  d c   to build thorium reactors 
the primary fuel of the proposed

the preceding figures are reserves and as such refer to the amount of thorium in high-concentration deposits inventoried so far and estimated to be extractable at current market prices  millions of times more total exist in earth s 31019 tonne crust  around 120 trillion tons of thorium  and lesser but vast quantities of thorium exist at intermediate concentrations  proved reserves are a good indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource 
types of thorium-based reactors
