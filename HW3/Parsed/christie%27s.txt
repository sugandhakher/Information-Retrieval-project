christie s was a public company  listed on the
from 1973 to 1999  in 1974  jo floyd was appointed chairman of christie s  he served as chairman of christie s international p l c  from 1976 to 1988  until handing over to   and later was a non-executive member of the board of directors until 1992  the auction house s subsidiary christie s international inc  held its first sale in the united states in 1977  13 years later than   christie s growth was slow but steady since 1989  when it had 42 percent of the auction market  in 1990  the company reversed a longstanding policy and guaranteed a minimum price for a collection of artworks in its may auctions  in 1996  the auction house s sales eclipsed sotheby s for the first time since 1954  however  its profits did not grow at the same pace  from 1993 through 1997  christie s annual pretax profits were about  60 million  whereas sotheby s annual pretax profits were about  265 million for those years 
in 1993  christie s paid  10.9 million for the london gallery spink   sons  which specialised in oriental art and british paintings  the gallery was run as a separate entity from the auction house  the company bought leger gallery for  3.3 million in 1996  and merged it with spink to become spink-leger  spink-leger was closed in 2002  to make itself competitive with sotheby s in real estate  christie s bought great estates in 1995  then the largest network of independent real estate brokers in north america  changing its name to christie s great estates inc 
1998 takeover  
in december 1997  under the chairmanship of   christie s put itself on the auction block  but after two months of negotiations with the consortium-led investment firm
it did not attract a bid high enough to accept  in may 1998   s holding company  groupe artmis s a   first bought 29.1 percent of the company for  243.2 million  and subsequently purchased the rest of it in a deal that valued the entire company at  1.2 billion  the company has since not been reporting profits  though it gives sale totals twice a year  its policy  in line with u k  accounting standards  is to convert non-u k  results using an average exchange rate weighted daily by sales throughout the year  in 2002  christie s france held its first auction in paris 
like sotheby s  christie s became increasingly involved in high-profile private transactions  in 2006  christie s offered a reported  21 million guarantee to the
and displayed the artist s works for five weeks in an exhibition that later won an
for  best installation in an alternative space   in 2007 the auction house brokered a  68 million deal that transferred  s
 1875  from the
at the
in philadelphia to joint ownership by the
and the   that same year    a contemporary art gallery which since 2002 had successfully conducted back-room sales of secondary-market works by major artists such as     and
from its locations in london and zrich  became a subsidiary of christie s international plc  under the original deal  the gallery was meant to be the channel for all of christie s private-client business as well as the focus of its primary trade  also  the auction house originally announced that haunch employees could not bid at auction because of conflicts of interest or issues of market manipulation  but later abandoned this rule  while christie s eventually retained the brand name and repositioned haunch as purely a primary-focused gallery  any secondary-market activities were taken over by the auction house s post-war and contemporary department  today  the gallery continues to operate as an independent company in london and new york  and again handles all of its secondary market activities itself
