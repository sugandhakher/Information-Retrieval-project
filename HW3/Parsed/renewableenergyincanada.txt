  ontario 
canada generates a significant majority of its electricity from
 59  in 2006  
is growing quickly with canada in 2011 being the 6th largest producer of wind power in the world  canada has built a number of photovoltaic power plants  mainly in ontario  with one in sarnia being the largest in the world at the time of construction  a 15 megawatt tidal plant sits at   and uses the daily tides of the   politicians have expressed interest in increasing the percentage of canada s electricity generated by renewable methods  ontario has created a subsidy to assist wind and solar power producers

produce over 90  of their power from hydroelectricity  quebec generates half of canada s hydroelectric power

canada has plentiful
resources  with the most extensive resources being found in southern  
and the prairies  the territories have a smaller potential  and less direct sunlight  because of their higher latitude 
with 1210 mwp of installed photovoltaics in 2013  canada ranked 15th among the world s countries  ontario has a program of moving away from coal and promoting renewable resources which has led to a number of industrial-scale photovoltaic plants being built  located in sarnia  ontario  the 97 megawatt
was briefly the largest solar farm in the world  in october 2010  and can power more than 12,000 homes  other plants include the 23.4 mw
and a 68 mw solar farm is in sault ste  marie 
until recently  the main applications of solar energy technologies in canada have been for non-electric
system applications for   water heating and drying crops and lumber  in 2001  there were more than 12,000 residential
systems and 300 commercial  industrial solar hot water systems in use  these systems presently comprise a small fraction of canadas energy use  but some government studies suggest they could make up as much as five per cent of the countrys energy needs by the year 2025 
canada has many regions that are sparsely populated and difficult to access 
 pv  cells are increasingly used as standalone units  mostly as off-grid distributed electricity generation to power remote homes  telecommunications equipment  oil and pipeline monitoring stations and navigational devices  the canadian pv market has grown quickly and canadian companies make solar modules  controls  specialized water pumps  high efficiency refrigerators and solar lighting systems 
one of the most important uses for pv cells is in northern communities  many of which depend on high-cost
to generate electricity  since the 1970s  the federal government and industry has encouraged the development of solar technologies for these communities  some of these efforts have focused on the use of hybrid systems that provide power 24 hours a day  using solar power when sunlight is available  in combination with another energy source 
wind power  
installed wind power capacity by province  2012 
main article 
at the end of 2011  wind power generating capacity in canada was 5,265
 mw   capable of generating 2.3  of   ontario  quebec and alberta each had more than 1000 mw of nameplate capacity  all provinces and territories  except nunavut  had some commercial wind power in 2012 
local policies  
ontario  
  now in force and effect  takes a two-pronged approach to creating a
economy  the first is to bring more
to the province and the second is the creation of more
measures to help   the bill also appoints a
to provide    assistance and support to project developers in order to facilitate project approvals  the approvals process for transmission projects are also
and for the first time in ontario  the bill enacts standards for renewable energy projects  homeowners now have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest
to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels
