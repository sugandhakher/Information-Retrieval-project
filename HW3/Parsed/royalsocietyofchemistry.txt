 cchem  and  through the science council the awards of chartered scientist  csci   registered scientist  rsci  and registered science technician  rsctech  to suitably qualified candidates  the designation frsc is given to a group of elected
who have made major contributions to chemistry and other interface disciplines such as biological chemistry  the names of fellows are published each year in
 london

the following are membership grades with
 designatory letters  
affiliate   no post-nominal  the grade for students and those involved in chemistry who do not meet the requirements for the following grades 
amrsc  associate member  royal society of chemistry the entry level for rsc membership  amrsc is awarded to graduates  or equivalent  in the chemical sciences 
mrsc  member  royal society of chemistry awarded to graduates  or equivalent  with at least 3 years  experience  who have acquired key skills through professional activity
frsc 
fellowship may be awarded to nominees who have made an outstanding contribution to chemistry  see   
honfrsc 
honorary fellowship is awarded for distinguished service in the field of chemistry 
cchem 
the award of cchem is considered separately from admission to a category of rsc membership  candidates need to be mrsc or frsc and demonstrate development of specific professional attributes and be in a job which requires their chemical knowledge and skills 
csci 
the rsc is a licensed by the
for the registration of  
eurchem 
the rsc is a member of the
 eccc   and can award this designation to chartered chemists 
mchema  mastership in chemical analysis the rsc awards this postgraduate qualification which is the uk statutory qualification for practice as a   it requires candidates to submit a portfolio of suitable experience and to take theory papers and a one-day laboratory practical examination 
grsc  
the qualification grsc  graduate of the royal society of chemistry  was awarded from 1981 to 1995 for completion of college courses equivalent to a chemistry degree and overseen by the rsc  it replaced the gric offered by the royal institute of chemistry 
divisions  
the society is organised around 9 divisions  based on subject areas  and local sections  both in the united kingdom and overseas  divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas 
analytical division for
and promoting the original aims of the society for analytical chemistry  12 subject groups 
dalton division  named after   for   6 subject groups 
education division for   4 subject groups 
faraday division  named after   for
and promoting the original aims of the faraday society  14 subject groups 
organic division for   6 subject groups 
chemical biology interface division  2 subject groups 
environment  sustainability and energy division  3 subject groups 
materials chemistry division  4 subject groups 
industry and technology division  13 subject groups 
there are 12 subjects groups not attached to a division 
local sections  
there are 35 local sections covering the united kingdom and   in countries of the
and many other countries there are local representatives of the society and often some activities

in addition to   including its flagship journals  
and   the society publishes 
for teachers 
a free online journal for chemistry educators   
a general chemistry magazine   sent monthly to all members of the society throughout the world  the editorial board consists of 10 academic and industrial chemists  it was first published in january 2004  it replaced chemistry in britain  first published in 1965  its contents include news  articles of a general chemical nature  such as the history of chemistry and technological developments  book reviews and letters from readers  its issn is 1473-7604 
is supported by the chemistry world podcast  which is presented by cambridge university scientist   who also edits  
professional reference books across the chemical sciences 
books for students  including the tutorial chemistry texts series of 23 books  edited by e  w  abel  and the 8 books in the molecular world series  whose coordinating editor is l  e  smart

the
offices of the society are in   piccadilly  events are hosted here for the public  rsc member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the rsc s public engagement website  the reaction  the free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music 
the events have attracted notable science writers such as     and
to give public lectures  most of these are available as archived video streams via the rsc s reaction website 
history  
although opened as the chemistry centre in 2010  the building has been occupied by the royal society of chemistry since 1857  at which time it was known as the chemical society   the heart of the chemistry centre is the rsc s library and information centre which itself dates back to 1842  over the years  the library for the rsc has received many gifts from notable fellows including   the library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available  in november 2014  the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply  royal society of chemistry at burlington house  and the name  chemistry centre  dropped 
library and information centre  
the society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects  including online access for members  housed at the chemistry centre at burlington house  it is part of the chemistry centre and is a resource for rsc members  although the public are also welcome 
benevolent fund  
the staircase at the royal society of chemistry  burlington house  designed by the partnership of robert richardson banks and charles barry  jr 
the royal society of chemistry s benevolent fund supports the members and their families during difficult times  through advice and guidance  financial support and volunteer support  it dates back to 1920 when the institute of chemistry  later the   established it as a memorial to its members who died in the first world war  it had an aim  to help necessitous persons who are  or have been  fellows or associates of the institute  their wives or children  and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased fellows and associates  through voluntary contributions from members  the benevolent fund s ethos of  members helping members  stems from the institute of chemistry s council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed 
in 1960  the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system  where members were asked to visit applicants  beneficiaries  elderly and housebound members in their area  each local section was also appointed a fund representative 
a major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003-2004  forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years  it underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to royal society of chemistry members and their families 
the benevolent fund committee  formed of volunteer members of the royal society of chemistry  oversees the benevolent fund and meet every three months

medals are awarded centrally by the rsc and by the divisions of the organisation  there are also awards that are administered by rsc interest groups 
the centrally awarded medals include the
which are awarded to a british chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry and the
which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry  including computer simulation   the tilden prize  previously known as the tilden lecture  consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry 
previous winners of the harrison-meldola prize  known as the
prior to its merger in 2008 with the edward harrison prize  include
