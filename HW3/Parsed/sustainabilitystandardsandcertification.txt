sustainability standards and certifications are voluntary  usually third party-assessed  norms and standards relating to environmental  social  ethical and food safety issues  adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas  there are perhaps up to 500 such standards and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade  the trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of
and standards for
and other products  in recent years  numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular  most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality  social equity  and economic prosperity  a standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested  this might cover  for instance  responsible fishing practices that don t endanger marine biodiversity  or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation  normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as  certification  - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard  as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain  often resulting in a consumer-facing label  certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard 
the basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold  firstly  they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and
movements around the globe demanded action  for example  campaigns by global exchange and other ngos against the purchase of goods from  factories by the likes of  
and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the
and others  secondly  leading brands selling to both consumers and to the
supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products  which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels  organic and other standards  a leading example of a consumer standard is the
movement  administered by
and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce  an example of a
standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the s standard  fsc  for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees 
however  the line between consumer and b2b sustainability standards is becoming blurred  with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding fairtrade certification  for example  and consumers increasingly recognizing the fsc mark  in recent years  the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries  in commodities such as palm oil  soy  farmed seafood  and sugar  certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and pre-competitive industry collaboration  major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering  rather than a single product line or ingredient 
with the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership  it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives  company and government buyers  as well as ngos and civil society groups committed to sustainable production  need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering real social  environmental and economic results  the
has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its codes of good practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective  by complying with these codes and working with other certification initiatives  iseal members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts 
attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of
project  facilitated by the
 unctad  and the
 iisd  under the auspices of the sustainable commodity initiative  sci

origin of global standards  
most sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by
in particular countries  such as rainforest alliance in the united states and fairtrade in the netherlands  other standards were initiated by individual companies  such as
 ahold   starbucks c a f e   starbucks   and nespresso aaa  nespresso   some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms  development agencies  ngos  and other stakeholders  for example  the common code for the coffee community  4c  was initiated by an alliance of main coffee roasters  including  
and   assisted by the german agency for technical cooperation and development     one important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving ngos  coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries  for example  the fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with mexican farmers  4c builds on development projects in peru  colombia and vietnam  involving giz  major coffee roasters  and local producers 
the most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture  with 40  of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes  and approximately 15-20  of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards  forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential  with certified production pushing past 10  of the global share  cotton  palm oil  soy  biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest  due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together  more recently  standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold  silver  aluminium  and oil and gas - as well as for cattle  electronics  plastics and tourism 
evidence suggests that corporate social responsibility  csr  adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated csr so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact 
the creation of the
in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally 
different sustainability standards  
numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality  social equity  and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices  despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures  there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development  target groups of adopters  geographical diffusion  and emphasis on environmental  social or economic issues 
one of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard  some standards set the high bar for a sector  promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations  other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices  often times there are strategies between or within standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability  another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally  usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness  whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus 
additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first  second or third party  the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials  and the types of sustainability claims that are made on and off products 
fairtrade  
the
label was developed in the late 1980s by a dutch development agency in collaboration with mexican farmers  the initiative performs development work and promotes its political vision of an alternative economy  seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets  the most distinguishing feature of the fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a social premium that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly  recently  fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system 
rainforest alliance  
the
was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity  one key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system so as to assist wildlife conservation  another objective is to improve workers welfare by establishing and securing sustainable livelihoods  producer prices may carry a premium  yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed floor price  the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency 
utz certified  
 formerly utz kapeh  was co-founded by the dutch coffee roaster ahold coffee company in 1997  it aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products  instruments include the utz traceability system and the utz code of conduct  the traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has stringent chains of custody requirements  the utz code of conduct emphasizes both environmental practices  e g  biodiversity conservation  waste handling and water use  and social benefits  e g  access to medical care  access to sanitary facilities at work  
organic  
the
standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on
basic standards  ifoam stands for international federation of organic agriculture movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement  the ifoam basic standards provide a framework of minimum requirements  including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers  the use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated  genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms  gmos  are forbidden 
trustea  
the
is designed to evaluate the social  economic  agronomic and environmental performance of indian tea estates  smallholders and bought leaf factories  blfs  
it is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach  the applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period  resulting in full compliance in a step wise approach by end of year 4  the india tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly  producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards  the verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers 
sure  the standard for sustainable and resilient infrastructure  
sure is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development  through various criteria across governance  social and environmental factors  it is currently developed under iseal guidelines by the swiss
 gib  and the french bank   gib and natixis have successfully launched the sure standard at a
event on 9 december 2015 
other examples  
other types of standard include sector-specific schemes such as the
 rspo   standards for climate and development interventions like the gold standard  retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as   corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as   and national programmes such as the  s  origin green  scheme 
united nations forum on sustainability standards   unfss 
it is a joint initiative of fao  unep  itc unctad and unido on sustainability standards
