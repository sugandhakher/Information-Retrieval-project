nameplate capacity  also known as the rated capacity  nominal capacity  installed capacity  or maximum effect  is the intended full-load sustained output of a facility such as a   a   fuel plant  metal refinery  mine  and many others  nameplate capacity is the number registered with authorities for classifying the
output of a power station usually expressed in  
power plants with an output consistently near their nameplate capacity have a high

dispatchable power  
for   this capacity depends on the internal technical capability of the plant to maintain output for a reasonable amount of time  for example  a day   neither momentarily nor permanently  and without considering external events such as lack of fuel or internal events such as maintenance  actual output can be different from nameplate capacity for a number of reasons depending on equipment and circumstances 
non-dispatchable power  
for   particularly   nameplate capacity refers to generation under ideal conditions  output is generally limited by weather conditions 
water levels 
variations and other outside forces  equipment failures and maintenance usually contribute less to capacity factor reduction than the innate variation of the power source  in   capacity is rated under standard test conditions usually expressed in the non- compliant unit
 wp   in addition  a  s nameplate capacity is sometimes denoted by a subindex  for example    in order to clarify  whether the raw
or already converted
power output is referred to

the term is connected with

as these plates describing the model name and manufacturer usually also contain the rated output  but the rated output of a power station to the
is invariably less than the generator nameplate capacity  because the components connecting the actual generator to the  grid  also use power  thus there is a distinction between component capacity and facility capacity
