this article is about a mode of transfer of energy  for other uses  see  
in   heat is
that spontaneously passes between a system and its surroundings in some way other than through
or the transfer of matter  when a suitable physical pathway exists  heat flows spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body  the transfer can be by contact between the source and the destination body  as in   or by
between remote bodies  or by conduction and radiation through a thick solid wall  or by way of an intermediate fluid body  as in   or by a combination of these 
because heat refers to a quantity of energy transferred between two bodies  it is not a
of either of the bodies  in contrast to
and   instead  according to the
heat exchanged during some process contributes to the change in the internal energy  and the amount of heat can be quantified by the equivalent amount of work that would bring about the same change 
while heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold  it is possible to construct a heat pump or refrigeration system that does work to increase the difference in temperature between two systems  conversely  a heat engine reduces an existing temperature difference to do work on another system 
historically  many energy units for measurement of heat have been used  the standards-based unit in the

history  
physicist   in his 1871 classic theory of heat  was one of many who began to build on the already established idea that heat has something to do with matter in motion  this was the same idea put forth by
in 1798  who said he was only following up on the work of many others  one of maxwell s recommended books was heat as a mode of motion  by   maxwell outlined four stipulations for the definition of heat 
it is something which may be transferred from one body to another  according to the  
it is a measurable quantity  and so can be treated mathematically 
it cannot be treated as a material substance  because it may be transformed into something that is not a material substance  e g    
heat is one of the forms of energy 
from empirically based ideas of heat  and from other empirical observations  the notions of internal energy and of entropy can be derived  so as to lead to the recognition of the first and second laws of thermodynamics  this was the way of the historical pioneers of thermodynamics 
transfers of energy as heat between two bodies  
referring to conduction 
writes   if a hot body is brought in conducting contact with a cold body  the temperature of the hot body falls and that of the cold body rises  and it is said that a quantity of heat has passed from the hot body to the cold body  
referring to radiation 
writes   in radiation  the hotter body loses heat  and the colder body receives heat by means of a process occurring in some intervening medium which does not itself thereby become hot  
maxwell writes that convection as such  is not a purely thermal phenomenon   in thermodynamics  convection in general is regarded as transport of   if  however  the convection is enclosed and circulatory  then it may be regarded as an intermediary that transfers energy as heat between source and destination bodies  because it transfers only energy and not matter from the source to the destination body 
practical operating devices that harness transfers of energy as heat  
in accordance with the first law for closed systems  energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another  changing the internal energies of each  transfer  between bodies  of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies  though it is not logically rigorous from the viewpoint of strict physical concepts  a common form of words that expresses this is to say that heat and work are interconvertible 
cyclically operating engines  that use only heat and work transfers  have two thermal reservoirs  a hot and a cold one  they may be classified by the range of operating temperatures of the working body  relative to those reservoirs  in a heat engine  the working body is at all times colder than the hot reservoir and hotter than the cold reservoir  in a sense  it uses heat transfer to produce work  in a heat pump  the working body  at stages of the cycle  goes both hotter than the hot reservoir  and colder than the cold reservoir  in a sense  it uses work to produce heat transfer 
heat engine  
in classical thermodynamics  a commonly considered model is the   it consists of four bodies  the working body  the hot reservoir  the cold reservoir  and the work reservoir  a cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state  and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often  work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible  and thus only one work reservoir is needed  but two thermal reservoirs are needed  because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible  a single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir and sent to the two other reservoirs  the work reservoir and the cold reservoir  the hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy  the second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir  heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater 
heat pump or refrigerator  
another commonly considered model is the
or refrigerator  again there are four bodies  the working body  the hot reservoir  the cold reservoir  and the work reservoir  a single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir  and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir  then the work reservoir does work on the working body  adding more to its internal energy  making it hotter than the hot reservoir  the hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir  but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir  then  by allowing it to expand without doing work on another body and without passing heat to another body  the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir  it can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle 
the device has transported energy from a colder to a hotter reservoir  but this is not regarded as being by an inanimate agency  rather  it is regarded as by the harnessing of work   this is because work is supplied from the work reservoir  not just by a simple thermodynamic process  but by a cycle of
and processes  which may be regarded as directed by an animate or harnessing agency  accordingly  the cycle is still in accord with the second law of thermodynamics  the efficiency of a heat pump is best when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is least 
functionally  such engines are used in two ways  distinguishing a target reservoir and a resource or surrounding reservoir  a heat pump transfers heat  to the hot reservoir as the target  from the resource or surrounding reservoir  a refrigerator transfers heat  from the cold reservoir as the target  to the resource or surrounding reservoir  the target reservoir may be regarded as leaking  when the target leaks hotness to the surroundings  heat pumping is used  when the target leaks coldness to the surroundings  refrigeration is used  the engines harness work to overcome the leaks 
macroscopic view of quantity of energy transferred as heat  
this section may need to be rewritten entirely to comply with wikipedia s     the
may contain suggestions   may 2016 
according to planck  there are three main conceptual approaches to heat  one is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach  the other two are macroscopic approaches  one is the approach through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics  with a mechanical analysis of processes  for example in the work of helmholtz  this mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory  the other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one  which admits heat as a primitive concept  which contributes  by scientific induction to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy  this view is widely taken as the practical one  quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry 
bailyn also distinguishes the two macroscopic approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic  the thermodynamic view was taken by the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century  it regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of temperature  measured primarily by calorimetry  a calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system  with its own temperature and internal energy  when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer  changes in it measure heat transfer  the mechanical view was pioneered by helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century  largely through the influence of   it regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept  defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer  the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics  defined by macroscopic mechanics  according to born  the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer of matter  cannot be reduced to mechanics   it follows that there is no well-founded definition of quantities of energy transferred as heat or as work associated with transfer of matter 
nevertheless  for the thermodynamical description of non-equilibrium processes  it is desired to consider the effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings  that is to say  when they are open with respect to one another  the impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy  a process that  in the thermodynamic view  might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat 
in this circumstance  it may be expected that there may also be active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy  such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter  and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis  such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient  and such interactions are known as cross-effects 
if cross-effects that result in diffusive transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers  they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient  never up one  they would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of one and the same kind  a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems  one might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux  in the thermodynamic view  the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed  in these circumstances  if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized  and there are no cross-effects  then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide  as if one were dealing with closed systems  but when there is transfer of matter  the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy  rather than being exactly knowable  mostly need to be assumed  and in many cases are practically unverifiable  consequently  when there is transfer of matter  the calculation of the pure  heat flux  component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions  this is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems  and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems 
in many writings in this context  the term  heat flux  is used when what is meant is therefore more accurately called diffusive flux of internal energy  such usage of the term  heat flux  is a residue of older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that a body may have a  heat content  
microscopic view of heat  
in the   heat is explained in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles  such as electrons  atoms  and molecules  the immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat  it is as a component of internal energy  in microscopic terms  heat is a transfer quantity  and is described by a transport theory  not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles  heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences  through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy  by particle collisions and other interactions  an early and vague expression of this was made by   precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century 
in   for a closed system  no transfer of matter   heat is the energy transfer associated with a disordered  microscopic action on the system  associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system  without change in the values of the energy levels themselves  it is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves  but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered  microscopic action  including radiative transfer  a
can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates 
notation and units  
as a form of energy heat has the unit
 j  in the
 si   however  in many applied fields in engineering the
 btu  and the
are often used  the standard unit for the rate of heat transferred is the watt  w   defined as joules per second 
the total amount of energy transferred as heat is conventionally written as q  from quantity  for algebraic purposes  heat released by a system into its surroundings is by convention a negative quantity  q 0   when a system absorbs heat from its surroundings  it is positive  q 0   heat transfer rate  or heat flow per unit time  is denoted by
q

  displaystyle   dot  q   
  this should not be confused with a time derivative of a
 which can also be written with the dot notation  since heat is not a function of state  heat flux is defined as rate of heat transfer per unit cross-sectional area  resulting in the unit watts per square metre 
estimation of quantity of heat  
quantity of heat transferred can measured by calorimetry  or determined through calculations based on other quantities 
calorimetry is the empirical basis of the idea of quantity of heat transferred in a process  the transferred heat is measured by changes in a body of known properties  for example  temperature rise  change in volume or length  or phase change  such as melting of ice 
a calculation of quantity of heat transferred can rely on a hypothetical quantity of energy transferred as
work and on the   such calculation is the primary approach of many theoretical studies of quantity of heat transferred 
internal energy and enthalpy  
for a
 a system from which no matter can enter or exit   one version of the
states that the change in
u of the system is equal to the amount of heat q supplied to the system minus the amount of
w done by system on its surroundings  the foregoing sign convention for work is used in the present article  but an alternate sign convention  followed by iupac  for work  is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive  this is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry  such as those by
and ira levine  but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system

this formula can be re-written so as to express a definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat  based purely on the concept of adiabatic work  if it is supposed that u is defined and measured solely by processes of adiabatic work

in this section we will neglect the  other-  or isochoric work contribution 
the internal energy  u  is a   in cyclical processes  such as the operation of a heat engine  state functions of the working substance return to their initial values upon completion of a cycle 
the differential  or infinitesimal increment  for the internal energy in an infinitesimal process is an
du  the symbol for
is the lowercase letter d 
in contrast  neither of the infinitesimal increments q nor w in an infinitesimal process represents the state of the system  thus  infinitesimal increments of heat and work are inexact differentials  the lowercase greek letter delta    is the symbol for   the integral of any inexact differential over the time it takes for a system to leave and return to the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal zero 
as recounted below  in the section headed   the second law of thermodynamics observes that if heat is supplied to a system in which no irreversible processes take place and which has a well-defined temperature t  the increment of heat q and the temperature t form the

in this scenario  the increase in enthalpy is equal to the quantity of heat added to the system  since many processes do take place at constant pressure  or approximately at atmospheric pressure  the enthalpy is therefore sometimes given the misleading name of  heat content   it is sometimes also called the heat function

in a transfer of energy as heat without work being done  there are changes of entropy in both the surroundings which lose heat and the system which gains it  the increase  s  of entropy in the system may be considered to consist of two parts  an increment  s that matches  or  compensates   the change  s  of entropy in the surroundings  and a further increment  s that may be considered to be  generated  or  produced  in the system  and is said therefore to be  uncompensated   thus

for purposes of mathematical analysis of transfers  one thinks of fictive processes that are called  reversible   with the temperature t of the system being hardly less than that of the surroundings  and the transfer taking place at an imperceptibly slow speed 
following the definition above in formula  1   for such a fictive  reversible  process  a quantity of transferred heat q  an   is analyzed as a quantity t ds  with ds  an

in an 1847 lecture entitled on matter  living force  and heat 
characterized the terms
and
as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena  namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles  respectively  he described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance  i e  a form of   and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles or what was known as a living force  at the time of joule kinetic energy either held  invisibly  internally or held  visibly  externally was known as a living force 
latent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a
or a
during a change of
that occurs without a change in temperature  such a process may be a   such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water  the term was introduced around 1750 by
as derived from the latin latere  to lie hidden   characterizing its effect as not being directly measurable with a thermometer 
sensible heat  in contrast to latent heat  is the heat transferred to a thermodynamic system that has as its sole effect a change of temperature 
both latent heat and sensible heat transfers increase the internal energy of the system to which they are transferred 
consequences of black s distinction between sensible and latent heat are examined in the  
specific heat  
  also called   is defined as the amount of energy that has to be transferred to or from one unit of
 kilogram  or
   to change the system temperature by one   specific heat is a physical property  which means that it depends on the substance under consideration and its state as specified by its properties 
the specific heats of monatomic gases  e g   helium  are nearly constant with temperature  diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence  and triatomic gases  e g   carbon dioxide  still more 
relation between heat and temperature  
before the discovery of the laws of thermodynamics  quantity of energy transferred as heat was measured by changes in the states of the participating bodies 
some general rules  with important exceptions  that will be indicated noted in following paragraphs of this section  can be stated as follows 
most bodies  over most temperature ranges  expand on being heated  mostly  heating a body at a constant volume increases the pressure it exerts on its constraining walls  and increases its temperature  also mostly  heating a body at a constant pressure increases its volume  and increases its temperature 
beyond this  most substances have three ordinarily recognized   solid  liquid  and gas  and a fourth less obviously recognized one    many have further  more finely differentiated  states of matter  such as for example    and   in many cases  at fixed temperature and pressure  a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter in what might be viewed as the same  body   for example  ice may float in a glass of water  then the ice and the water are said to constitute two
within the  body   definite
are known  telling how distinct phases may coexist in a  body   mostly  at a fixed pressure  there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate  and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate  in such cases  cooling has the reverse effects 
all of these  the commonest cases  fit with a rule that heating can be measured by changes of state of a body  such cases supply what are called   that allow the definition of empirical temperatures  before 1848  all temperatures were defined in this way  there was thus a tight link  apparently logically determined  between heat and temperature  though they were recognized as conceptually thoroughly distinct  especially by
in the later eighteenth century 
there are important exceptions  they break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature  they make it clear that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances  and are thus precluded from the title  absolute   for example 
on being heated near 277k  it cannot be used as a thermometric substance near that temperature  also  over a certain temperature range  ice contracts on heating  moreover  many substances can exist in metastable states  such as with negative pressure  that survive only transiently and in very special conditions  such facts  sometimes called  anomalous   are some of the reasons for the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature 
in the early days of measurement of high temperatures  another factor was important  and used by
in his   the temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay  the higher the temperature  the more the shrinkage  this was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above 1000c  but such shrinkage is irreversible  the clay does not expand again on cooling  that is why it could be used for the measurement  but only once  it is not a thermometric material in the usual sense of the word 
nevertheless  the
of absolute temperature does make essential use of the concept of heat  with proper circumspection 
relation between hotness and temperature  
according to denbigh  the property of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined without reference to the concept of heat  consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature  all physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others  this does not require that they have thermodynamic temperatures  with reference to hotness  the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder 
if a physical system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing  for example by turbulence  it may be impossible to characterize it by a temperature  but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system  if a system has a physical state that is regular enough  and persists long enough to allow it to reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer  then it has a temperature according to that thermometer  an empirical thermometer registers degree of hotness for such a system  such a temperature is called empirical  for example  truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics   at each time  the body is assigned a real number called the temperature  this number is a measure of how hot the body is  
physical systems that are too turbulent to have temperatures may still differ in hotness  a physical system that passes heat to another physical system is said to be the hotter of the two  more is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature  its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers  and then its hotness is said to lie on the one-dimensional hotness manifold  this is part of the reason why heat is defined following carathodory and born  solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter  temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition 
this is also the reason why the
is stated explicitly  if three physical systems  a  b  and c are each not in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium  it is possible that  with suitable physical connections being made between them  a can heat b and b can heat c and c can heat a  in non-equilibrium situations  cycles of flow are possible  it is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems  as distinguished amongst physical systems  which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium  this is the reason why the
needs explicit statement  that is to say  the relation  is not colder than  between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive  whereas  in contrast  the relation  has no lower a temperature than  between thermodynamic systems in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive  it follows from this that the relation  is in thermal equilibrium with  is transitive  which is one way of stating the zeroth law 
just as temperature may undefined for a sufficiently inhomogeneous system  so also may entropy be undefined for a system not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium  for example   the temperature of the solar system  is not a defined quantity  likewise   the entropy of the solar system  is not defined in classical thermodynamics  it has not been possible to define non-equilibrium entropy  as a simple number for a whole system  in a clearly satisfactory way 
rigorous definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat  
it is sometimes convenient to have a rigorous definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat  such a definition is customarily based on the work of
 1909   referring to processes in a closed system  as follows 
the
ux of a body in an arbitrary state x can be determined by amounts of work adiabatically performed by the body on its surrounds when it starts from a reference state o  such work is assessed through quantities defined in the surroundings of the body  it is supposed that such work can be assessed accurately  without error due to friction in the surroundings  friction in the body is not excluded by this definition  the adiabatic performance of work is defined in terms of adiabatic walls  which allow transfer of energy as work  but no other transfer  of energy or matter  in particular they do not allow the passage of energy as heat  according to this definition  work performed adiabatically is in general accompanied by friction within the thermodynamic system or body  on the other hand  according to carathodory  1909   there also exist non-adiabatic walls  which are postulated to be  permeable only to heat   and are called diathermal 
for the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat  it is customarily envisaged that an arbitrary state of interest y is reached from state o by a process with two components  one adiabatic and the other not adiabatic  for convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum of work done by the body through volume change through movement of the walls while the non-adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered adiabatic  and of isochoric adiabatic work  then the non-adiabatic component is a process of energy transfer through the wall that passes only heat  newly made accessible for the purpose of this transfer  from the surroundings to the body  the change in internal energy to reach the state y from the state o is the difference of the two amounts of energy transferred 
although carathodory himself did not state such a definition  following his work it is customary in theoretical studies to define the quantity of energy transferred as heat  q  to the body from its surroundings  in the combined process of change to state y from the state o  as the change in internal energy  uy  minus the amount of work  w  done by the body on its surrounds by the adiabatic process  so that q   uy  w 
in this definition  for the sake of conceptual rigour  the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non-adiabatic process  it is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables  the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done  for the combined process of change from the reference state o to the arbitrary state y  it is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non-adiabatic component of the combined process  it is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state o to state y  the change of internal energy  is known  independently of the combined process  by a determination through a purely adiabatic process  like that for the determination of the internal energy of state x above  the rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental  energy transferred as work  energy transfer as heat is considered as a derived quantity  the uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception  the conceptual purity of this definition  based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion  relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non-dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality  the second law of thermodynamics  on the other hand  assures us that such processes are not found in nature 
heat  temperature  and thermal equilibrium regarded as jointly primitive notions  
before the rigorous mathematical definition of heat based on carathodory s 1909 paper  recounted just above  historically  heat  temperature  and thermal equilibrium were presented in thermodynamics textbooks as jointly   carathodory introduced his 1909 paper thus   the proposition that the discipline of thermodynamics can be justified without recourse to any hypothesis that cannot be verified experimentally must be regarded as one of the most noteworthy results of the research in thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last century   referring to the  point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years   carathodory wrote   there exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities  mass  force  pressure  etc   and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements  
introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus   in the following section  we shall use the classical notions of heat  work  and hotness as primitive elements      that heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by carnot  its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept  as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories   this traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non-uniformity of temperature  and is by conduction and radiation  from hotter to colder bodies  it is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on  circular reasoning   against this proposal  there stands the rigorously logical mathematical development of the theory presented by truesdell and bharatha  1977  
this alternative approach to the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat differs in logical structure from that of carathodory  recounted just above 
this alternative approach admits calorimetry as a primary or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat  it relies on temperature as one of its primitive concepts  and used in calorimetry  it is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies  such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work  they include calorimetry  which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences  the needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic 
in contrast  the carathodory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat  the carathodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat  as recounted in more detail just above  the carathodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity  it is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system  and from the actual work done by the system during the process  that internal energy difference is supposed to have been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work  processes that take the system between the initial and final states  by the carathodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes  so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat  this presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the carathodory way  in fact  the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition  and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist

and   deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated  or converted  or transferred to another system  although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy  the term heat transfer encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language 
heat transfer includes the mechanisms of     and  
in engineering  the term
is used to describe the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow  from the thermodynamic point of view  heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy  the fluid then transfers    this increased internal energy  not heat  from one location to another  and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system  again by diffusion  this entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer  although technically   heat transfer  and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow  but not as a result of flow  thus  conduction can be said to  transfer  heat only as a net result of the process  but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process 
although distinct physical laws may describe the behavior of each of these methods  real systems often exhibit a complicated combination which are often described by a variety of mathematical methods

quotations  
denbigh states in a footnote that he is indebted to correspondence with
and with professor n k  adam  from this  denbigh concludes  it seems  however  that when a system is able to exchange both heat and matter with its environment  it is impossible to make an unambiguous distinction between energy transported as heat and by the migration of matter  without already assuming the existence of the  heat of transport    denbigh k g   1951   p  56 
 heat must therefore consist of either living force or of attraction through space  in the former case we can conceive the constituent particles of heated bodies to be  either in whole or in part  in a state of motion  in the latter we may suppose the particles to be removed by the process of heating  so as to exert attraction through greater space  i am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good that in some instances  particularly in the case of sensible heat  or such as is indicated by the thermometer  heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced  whilst in others  particularly in the case of latent heat  the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle  so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space
