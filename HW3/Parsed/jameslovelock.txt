biography  
james lovelock was born in
in   england  to working class parents who were strong believers in education  nell  his mother  started work at 13 in a pickle factory  his father  tom  had served six months hard labour for poaching in his teens and was illiterate until attending technical college  the family moved to london where lovelock s dislike of authority made him  by his own account  an unhappy pupil at   lovelock could not afford to go to university after school  something which he believes helped prevent him becoming over-specialised and aided the development of gaia theory  he worked at a photography firm  attending
during the evenings  before being accepted to study chemistry at the   where he was a student of the nobel prize laureate   lovelock worked at a quaker farm before a recommendation from his professor led to him taking up a
post  working on ways of shielding soldiers from burns  lovelock refused to use the shaved and anaesthetised rabbits that were used as burn victims  and exposed his own skin to heat radiation instead  an experience he describes as  exquisitely painful   his student status enabled temporary deferment of
during the   but he registered as a   he later abandoned this position in the light of
atrocities  and tried to enlist in the armed forces  but was told that his medical research was too valuable for the enlistment to be approved  in 1948 lovelock received a
degree in medicine at the   in the united states  he has conducted research at     and  
career  
james lovelock around 1960
a lifelong inventor  lovelock has created and developed many scientific instruments  some of which were designed for
in its program of planetary exploration  it was while working as a consultant for nasa that lovelock developed the gaia hypothesis  for which he is most widely known  he also claims to have invented the  
in early 1961  lovelock was engaged by nasa to develop sensitive instruments for the analysis of extraterrestrial atmospheres and planetary surfaces  the   that visited
in the late 1970s  was motivated in part to determine whether mars supported life  and many of the sensors and experiments that were ultimately deployed aimed to resolve this issue  during work on a precursor of this program  lovelock became interested in the composition of the   reasoning that many life forms on mars would be obliged to make use of it  and  thus  alter it   however  the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its   with very little oxygen  methane  or hydrogen  but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide  to lovelock  the stark contrast between the martian atmosphere and chemically dynamic mixture of that of the earth s biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of life on the planet  however  when they were finally launched to mars  the viking probes still searched  unsuccessfully  for
life there 
electron capture detector developed by lovelock  and in the
lovelock invented the   which ultimately assisted in discoveries about the persistence of
and their role in
  after studying the operation of the earth s   lovelock and his colleagues   
and stephen g  warren developed the
as a possible example of biological control of the earth s climate 
lovelock was elected a fellow of the
in 1974  he served as the president of the
 mba  from 1986 to 1990  and has been an honorary visiting fellow of
 formerly   since 1994  he has been awarded a number of prestigious prizes including the tswett medal  1975   an
chromatography award  1980   the
norbert gerbier prize  1988   the
for the environment  1990  and the
discovery lifetime award  2001   in 2006 he received the   the geological society s highest award  whose previous recipients include charles darwin   he became a commander of the order of the british empire
in 1990  and a member of the
in 2003  he is a patron of population concern charity  
as an   inventor  and author  lovelock worked out of a barn-turned-laboratory he called his  experimental station  located in a wooded valley on the   border in the south-west of england 
on 8 may 2012  he appeared on the
series  the life scientific   talking to
about the gaia hypothesis  on the program  he mentioned how his ideas had been received by various people  including   he also mentioned how he had a claim for inventing the
oven  he later explained this claim in an interview with   lovelock said that he did create an instrument during his time studying causes of damage to living cells and tissue  which had  according to him   almost everything you would expect in an ordinary microwave oven   he invented the instrument for the purpose of heating up frozen hamsters in a way that caused less suffering to the animals  as opposed to the traditional way which involved putting red hot spoons on the animals  chest to heat them up  he believes that at the time  nobody had gone that far and made an embodiment of an actual microwave oven  however  he does not claim to have been the first person to have the idea of using microwaves for cooking 
cfcs  
reconstructed time-series of atmospheric concentrations of cfc-11 
main article 
after the development of his   in the late 1960s  lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of cfcs in the atmosphere  he found a concentration of 60
of
over ireland and  in a partially self-funded research expedition in 1972  went on to measure the concentration of cfc-11 from the northern hemisphere to the antarctic aboard the
  he found the gas in each of the 50 air samples that he collected but  not realising that the breakdown of cfcs in the stratosphere would release
that posed a threat to the   concluded that the level of cfcs constituted  no conceivable hazard   he has since stated that he meant  no conceivable toxic hazard  
however  the experiment did provide the first useful data on the ubiquitous presence of cfcs in the atmosphere  the damage caused to the ozone layer by the
of cfcs was later discovered by
and   after hearing a lecture on the subject of lovelock s results  sherwood and molina embarked on research that resulted in the first published paper that suggested a link between stratospheric cfcs and
in 1974  for which they later shared the 1995
with   
gaia  
further information 
first formulated by lovelock during the 1960s as a result of work for
concerned with detecting life on mars  the gaia hypothesis proposes that living and non-living parts of the earth form a
that can be thought of as a single   named after the
at the suggestion of novelist   the hypothesis postulates that the
has a regulatory effect on the earth s environment that acts to sustain life 
while the
was readily accepted by many in the
community  it has not been widely accepted within the   among its most prominent critics are the evolutionary biologists     and
 notable  given the diversity of this trio s views on other scientific matters  these  and other  critics have questioned how
operating on individual organisms can lead to the evolution of planetary-scale  
in response to this  together with
 lovelock published the computer model
in 1983  that postulated a hypothetical
orbiting a star whose radiant energy is
  in the non-biological case  the temperature of this planet simply tracks the energy received from the star  however  in the biological case  ecological competition between  daisy  species with different albedo values produces a homeostatic effect on global temperature  when energy received from the star is low  black daisies proliferate since they absorb a greater fraction of the heat  while when energy input is high  white daisies are competitively advantaged since they reflect excess heat away  as the daisies  white and black  affect the planet s overall albedo and temperature  changes in their relative populations act to stabilise the planet s climate and to keep temperature within an optimal range despite changes in   lovelock argued that daisyworld  although a parable  illustrates how conventional natural selection operating on individual organisms can still produce planetary-scale homeostasis 
in lovelock s 2006 book    he argues that the lack of respect humans have had for gaia  through the damage done to
and the reduction in planetary biodiversity  is testing gaia s capacity to minimize the effects of the addition of
in the atmosphere  this eliminates the planet s
and increases the likelihood of
potential associated with runaway   similarly the warming of the oceans is extending the oceanic
layer of tropical oceans into the arctic and antarctic waters  preventing the rise of oceanic nutrients into the surface waters and eliminating the
of
on which oceanic
depend  as phytoplankton and forests are the main ways in which gaia draws down greenhouse gases  particularly carbon dioxide  taking it out of the atmosphere  the elimination of this environmental buffering will see  according to lovelock  most of the earth becoming uninhabitable for humans and other life-forms by the middle of this century  with a massive extension of tropical deserts   in 2012  lovelock distanced himself from these conclusions  saying he had  gone too far  in describing the consequences of climate change over the next century in this book  
in his 2009 book   the vanishing face of gaia   he rejects scientific modelling that disagrees with the scientific findings that sea levels are rising faster  and arctic ice is melting faster  than the models predict and he suggests that we may already be beyond the tipping point of terrestrial climate resilience into a permanently hot state  given these conditions  lovelock expects human civilization will be hard pressed to   he expects the change to be similar to the
when
was 450 ppm  at that point the arctic ocean was 23c and had crocodiles in it  with the rest of the world mostly scrub and desert       
nuclear power  
lovelock has become concerned about the threat of global warming from the   in 2004 he caused a media sensation when he broke with many fellow environmentalists by pronouncing that  only nuclear power can now halt global warming   in his view  nuclear energy is the only realistic alternative to fossil fuels that has the capacity to both fulfill the large scale energy needs of humankind while also reducing greenhouse emissions  he is an open member of  
in 2005  against the backdrop of renewed uk government interest in nuclear power  lovelock again publicly announced his support for nuclear energy  stating   i am a green  and i entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy   although these interventions in the public debate on nuclear power are recent  his views on it are longstanding  in his 1988 book the ages of gaia he states 
 i have never regarded
or nuclear power as anything other than a normal and inevitable part of the environment  our
forebears evolved on a planet-sized lump of
from a star-sized nuclear explosion  a
that
the
that go to make our planet and ourselves  
in
 2006   where he puts forward the concept of   lovelock writes 
 a television interviewer once asked me   but what about nuclear waste  will it not poison the whole biosphere and persist for millions of years   i knew this to be a nightmare fantasy wholly without substance in the real world    one of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive nuclides is the richness of their wildlife  this is true of the land around   the bomb test sites of the pacific  and areas near the united states 
nuclear weapons plant of the second world war  wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous  and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets    i find it sad  but all too human  that there are vast bureaucracies concerned about nuclear waste  huge organisations devoted to decommissioning power stations  but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste  carbon dioxide  
climate  
main articles 
and
writing in the british newspaper
in january 2006  lovelock argued that  as a result of global warming   billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the arctic where the climate remains tolerable  by the end of the 21st century  he has been quoted in
that 80  of humans will perish by 2100 ad  and this climate change will last 100,000 years  according to james lovelock  by 2040  the world population of more than six billion will have been culled by floods  drought and famine  indeed    t he people of southern europe  as well as south-east asia  will be fighting their way into countries such as canada  australia and britain  
 by 2040  parts of the sahara desert will have moved into middle europe  we are talking about paris  as far north as berlin  in britain we will escape because of our oceanic position  
 if you take the
predictions  then by 2040 every summer in europe will be
 between 110f and 120f  it is not the death of people that is the main problem  it is the fact that the plants can t grow there will be almost no food grown in europe  
 we are about to take an evolutionary step and my hope is that the species will emerge stronger  it would be
to think humans as they now are god s chosen race  
he further predicted  the average temperature in temperate regions would increase by as much as 8c and by up to 5c in the tropics  leaving much of the world s land uninhabitable and unsuitable for farming  with northerly migrations and new cities created in the arctic  he predicted much of europe will have become uninhabitable having turned to desert and britain will have become europe s  life-raft  due to its stable temperature caused by being surrounded by the ocean  he suggested that  we have to keep in mind the awesome pace of change and realise how little time is left to act  and then each community and nation must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation for as long as they can  
he partly retreated from this position in a september 2007 address to the  s annual symposium  suggesting that climate change would stabilise and prove survivable  and that the earth itself is in  no danger  because it would stabilise in a new state  life  however  might be forced to migrate en masse to remain in habitable climes  in 2009  he became a patron of
 formerly known as the optimum population trust   which campaigns for a gradual decline in the global human population to a sustainable level 
in a march 2010 interview with the guardian newspaper  he said that democracy might have to be  put on hold  to prevent climate change  he continued 
 even the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches  democracy must be put on hold for the time being  i have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war  it may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while  
statements from 2012 portray lovelock as continuing his concern over global warming while at the same time criticizing extremism and suggesting alternatives to oil  coal and the green solutions he does not support 
in an april 2012 interview  aired on   lovelock stated that he had been  alarmist   using the words all right  i made a mistake  about the timing of climate change and noted the documentary
and the book
as examples of the same kind of alarmism  lovelock still believes the climate to be warming although the rate of change is not as he once thought  he admitted that he had been extrapolating too far   he believes that climate change is still happening  but it will be felt farther in the future  of the claims the science is settled on global warming he states 
 one thing that being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything  you never know the truth  you can only approach it and hope to get a bit nearer to it each time  you iterate towards the truth  you dont know it  
he criticizes environmentalists for treating global warming like a religion 
it just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the christian religion  lovelock observed
i dont think people have noticed that  but its got all the sort of terms that religions use  the greens use guilt  that just shows how religious greens are  you cant win people round by saying they are guilty for putting  carbon dioxide  in the air 
in the msnbc article lovelock is quoted as proclaiming 
 the problem is we don t know what the climate is doing  we thought we knew 20 years ago  that led to some alarmist books  mine included  because it looked clear-cut  but it hasnt happened   he continues
 the climate is doing its usual tricks  theres nothing much really happening yet  we were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now   he said
the world has not warmed up very much since the millennium  twelve years is a reasonable time     it  the temperature  has stayed almost constant  whereas it should have been rising - carbon dioxide is rising  no question about that   he added 
in a follow up interview lovelock stated his support for   he now favors
as a low-polluting alternative to coal  he opposes the concept of  sustainable development   where modern economies might be powered by wind turbines  calling it meaningless drivel  he keeps a poster of a
to remind himself how much he detests them 
geoengineering  climate engineering   
in september 2007  lovelock and
proposed the construction of ocean pumps to pump water up from below the
to  fertilize algae in the surface waters and encourage them to bloom   the basic idea was to accelerate the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean by increasing
and enhancing the
of organic carbon  as   to the deep ocean  a scheme similar to that proposed by lovelock and rapley is already being independently developed by a commercial company 
the proposal attracted widespread
attention and criticism  commenting on the proposal    a
researcher  said  it doesnt make sense  there is absolutely no evidence that
options work or even go in the right direction  im astonished that they published this  before any geoengineering is put to work a massive amount of research is needed  research which will take 20 to 30 years   other researchers have claimed that  this scheme would bring water with high natural pco2 levels  associated with the nutrients  back to the surface  potentially causing exhalation of co2   lovelock subsequently said that his proposal was intended to stimulate interest and research would be the next step 
sustainable retreat  
sustainable retreat is a concept developed by james lovelock in order to define the necessary changes to human settlement and dwelling at the global scale with the purpose of adapting to global warming and preventing its expected negative consequences on humans 
lovelock thinks the time is past for   and that we have come to a time when development is no longer   therefore  we need to retreat  lovelock states the following in order to explain the concept 
retreat  in his view  means it s time to start talking about changing where we live and how we get our food  about making plans for the migration of millions of people from low-lying regions like
into europe  about admitting that
is a goner and moving the people to cities better positioned for the future  most of all  he says  it s about everybody  absolutely doing their utmost to sustain civilization  so that it doesn t degenerate into dark ages  with warlords running things  which is a real danger  we could lose everything that way 
the concept of sustainable retreat emphasized a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs with lower levels and or less environmentally harmful types of resources 
awards and honours  
lovelock was elected a fellow of the
in 1974  his nomination reads 
lovelock has made distinguished contributions to several diverse fields  including a study of the transmission of
infection  and methods of air   the role of
and other
in   damage to various living cells by freezing  thawing and
and its prevention by the presence of neutral   methods of freezing and thawing small live animals  methods for preparing sperm for   which have been of major economic importance 
he has invented a family of
detectors for   his
are the most sensitive that have been made and are universally used on pollution problems for residual halogen compounds  he has many inventions  including a gas chromatograph  which will be used to investigate planetary atmospheres  his chromatographic work has led to investigation of blood lipids in various animals  including
humans  he has made a study of detecting life on other planets by analysis of their atmosphere and extended this to world pollution problems  his work generally shows remarkable originality  simplicity and ingenuity
