during the middle ages  instead of earth and ceramic ovens  europeans used fireplaces in conjunction with large cauldrons  these were similar to the dutch oven  following the middle-ages  ovens underwent many changes over time from wood  iron  coal  gas  and even electric  each design had its own motivation and purpose  the wood burning stoves saw improvement through the addition of fire chambers that allowed better containment and release of smoke  another recognizable oven would be the cast-iron stove  these were first used around the early 1700s when they themselves underwent several variations including the stewart oberlin iron stove that was smaller and had its own chimney 
in the early part of the 19th century  coal ovens were developed  its shape was cylindrical and was made of heavy cast-iron  the gas oven saw its first use as early as the beginning of the 19th century as well  gas stoves became very common household ovens once gas lines were available to most houses and neighborhoods  james sharp patented one of the first gas stoves in 1826  other various improvements to the gas stove included the
invented in 1922 by   the first electric ovens were invented in the very late 19th century  however  like many electrical inventions destined for commercial use  mass ownership of electrical ovens could not be a reality until better and more efficient use of electricity was available 
more recently  ovens have become slightly more high-tech in terms of cooking strategy  the microwave as a cooking tool was discovered by percy spencer in 1946  and with the help from engineers  the microwave oven was patented  the microwave oven uses microwave radiation to excite the molecules in food causing friction  thus producing heat

  an earth oven is a pit dug into the ground and then heated  usually by rocks or smoldering debris  historically these have been used by many cultures for cooking  cooking times are usually long  and the process is usually cooking by slow roasting the food  earth ovens are among the most common things archaeologists look for at an anthropological dig  as they are one of the key indicators of human civilization and static society

gas oven  one of the first recorded uses of a gas stove and oven referenced a dinner party in 1802 hosted by zachaus winzler  where all the food was prepared either on a gas stove or in its oven compartment  in 1834  british inventor james sharp began to commercially produce gas ovens after installing one in his own house  in 1851  the bower s registered gas stove was displayed at the great exhibition  this stove would set the standard and basis for the modern gas oven  notable improvements to the gas stove since include the addition of the thermostat which assisted in temperature regulation  also an enamel coating was added to the production of gas stoves and ovens in order to help with easier cleaning 
  masonry ovens consist of a baking chamber made of fireproof       or   though traditionally   -fired ovens were common in the 19th century  modern masonry ovens are often fired with

ovens also vary in the way that they are controlled  the simplest ovens  for example  the   may not have any controls at all  the ovens simply run continuously at various temperatures  more conventional ovens have a simple
which turns the oven on and off and selects the temperature at which it will operate  set to the highest setting  this may also enable the broiler element  a
