the american council for an energy-efficient economy  or aceee  is a  
organization  founded in 1980  aceee s mission is to act as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies  programs  technologies  investments  and behaviors in order to help achieve greater economic prosperity  energy security  and environmental protection 
aceee promotes energy efficiency by conducting technical and policy analyses  advising policymakers and program managers  and working collaboratively with businesses  government officials  public interest groups  and other organizations  it convenes conferences and workshops  primarily for energy efficiency professionals  and produces reports  books  conference proceedings  and media outreach 
aceee employs more than 35 -based employees  and holds field offices in delaware  michigan  washington  and wisconsin  the organization s primary focuses are on end-use efficiency in       and  
and   and state and national

federal and state energy policy  
federal policy  
aceee has worked on
since the 1980s  the organization played central roles in the development of the
of 1987  energy efficiency provisions in the
and the   and the   it also played a role in the development of energy efficiency sections in recent   many of these provisions were developed in cooperation with interested business and received
support 
aceee staff testify before
and work closely with congressional staff in both
to help shape new initiatives and analyze the impacts of energy and climate policy proposals  they weigh in on the   promoting and increasing funding for what they deem the most effective energy efficiency programs 
the organization also works with federal agencies such as the
and the
on programs and policies  and participates in formal rulemakings on energy efficiency issues  most of aceee s federal policy work involves research and education  however  they do a limited amount of
using unrestricted funds 
they supported the   a bill that would exempt certain
from complying with standards set forth in a final rule published by the
in february 2014  the
describes the bill as a bill that  provides regulatory relief by making a simple technical correction to the
to exempt certain power supply  eps  service and spare parts from federal efficiency standards  
state policy  
at the state level  aceee works closely with public officials and local energy efficiency advocates  providing advice  analysis  and technical support  in order to maximize its impact  the organization concentrates its efforts on large states that are poised to make major decisions on energy efficiency policy issues  for example  in 2007 and 2008  it emphasized work in             and   all of these states passed significant energy efficiency legislation  with additional legislation and regulations likely in some of them 
aceee also works on state policies that can potentially be adopted at the national level  for example  staff have worked with several states to develop state appliance and equipment   which have subsequently been adopted by congress 
research and analysis  
aceee devotes much of its resources to research and analysis in order to discern the best technical  program  and policy practices that promote efficient energy use  and to define the magnitude of benefits of energy efficiency  research staff survey market trends and activities  analyze technical and economic potential for energy efficiency  seek to understand consumer energy decisions  and assess the potential for   policies  and programs to achieve energy savings  aceee s research programs include 
buildings and equipment - aceee s oldest research program analyzes opportunities for energy efficiency in
and equipment      and operation  and programs and policies that encourage consumers to make energy-efficient product choices 
utilities - serves as the principal documenter and reviewer of publicly funded energy efficiency programs and supporting policies  preparing regular surveys of best practices and supporting implementers and
in designing the next generation of programs and policies 
transportation - tracks vehicle technology and estimates the potential for future energy efficiency  in addition  the program explores technologies and policies that encourage changes in personal and
transportation markets to further reduce energy use 
industry - applies unique experience in energy efficiency for the
sector  including
such as    and assesses     programs  and policies to achieve increased energy efficiency in manufacturing 
agriculture - addresses the unique energy efficiency program and policy needs of
and
through assessment of energy use patterns  and opportunities for more energy efficiency practices and technologies 
economic analysis - encourages the use of sound
practices  studies the impacts of energy policies on the economy  and projects the
of energy efficiency technologies  practices  and policies 
state analysis - cross-program effort that combines expertise from other research programs to assess state energy policies  analyze the potential for energy efficiency at the state level  and collect key resources to support state policymakers  program implementers  and efficiency advocates 
international - works with colleagues from transitional economies to adapt technology  program  and policy experiences from the united states to these economies 
outreach  
aceee attempts to reach out to and inform diverse audiences in a variety of ways 
conferences  
aceee holds several conferences each year that aim to bring together disparate stakeholders to focus on multiple aspects of energy efficiency and the role it plays in addressing critical issues such as     utility structure and regulation  and energy use in buildings  industry  and agriculture  recent conferences include 
2013 summer study on energy efficiency in industry
2012 summer study on energy efficiency in buildings
hot water forum  water heating  distribution  and use efficiency
energy efficiency finance forum
national symposium on market transformation
forum on energy efficiency and agriculture
behavior  energy  and climate change conference  becc 
national conference on energy efficiency as a resource
publications  
aceee provides research and technical analysis of current energy efficiency policies and practices  as well as forecasting future trends  these publications include research reports  consumer books  white papers  legislative testimony  and conference proceedings  major recent aceee reports include 
energizing virginia  efficiency first
the size of the u s  energy efficiency market  generating a more complete picture
compendium of champions  chronicling exemplary energy efficiency programs from across the u s 
the 2008 state energy efficiency scorecard
information and communication technologies  the power of productivity
assessment of the house renewable electricity standard and expanded clean energy scenarios
the web  
aceee shares its work online by providing publications and conference presentations on the internet  while not a consumer-focused organization  aceee has several web resources devoted to educating consumers about making wise energy efficiency choices relating to their homes and their vehicles  through 
 based on consumer guide to home energy savings 
 online presence of aceee s green book  the environmental guide to cars and trucks 
ally program  
aceee convenes primary stakeholders in discussions and networking opportunities through policy briefings 
covering recent published research and analysis  and one-to-one interaction with staff and board members
