pubmed is a free search engine accessing primarily the
of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics  the
 nlm  at the
maintains the database as part of the
system of  
from 1971 to 1997  medline online access to the
computerized database had been primarily through institutional facilities  such as   pubmed  first released in january 1996  ushered in the era of private  free  home- and office-based medline searching  the pubmed system was offered free to the public in june 1997  when medline searches via the web were demonstrated  in a ceremony  by vice president  
contents
content  
in addition to medline  pubmed provides access to 
older references from the print version of
back to 1951 and earlier 
references to some journals before they were indexed in index medicus and medline  for instance     and  
very recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with
 mesh  and added to medline  and
a collection of books available full-text and other subsets of nlm records 
citations
many pubmed records contain links to full text articles  some of which are freely available  often in
and local mirrors such as  
information about the journals indexed in medline and available through pubmed is found in the nlm catalog 
as of 8 february 2015  pubmed has over 24.6 million records going back to 1966  selectively to the year 1865  and very selectively to 1809  about 500,000 new records are added each year  as of the same date  13.1 million of pubmed s records are listed with their abstracts  and 14.2 million articles have links to full-text  of which 3.8 million articles are available full-text for free for any user    
in 2016  nlm changed the indexing system so that publishers will be able to directly correct typos and errors in pubmed indexed articles 
characteristics  
standard searches  
simple searches on pubmed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into pubmed s search window 
pubmed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names  relevant mesh  medical subject headings  terms  synonyms  boolean operators  and  nests  the resulting terms appropriately  enhancing the search formulation significantly  in particular by routinely combining  using the or operator  textwords and mesh terms 
the examples given in a pubmed tutorial demonstrate how this automatic process works 
causes sleep walking is translated as   etiology  subheading  or  etiology  all fields  or  causes  all fields  or  causality  mesh terms  or  causality  all fields   and   somnambulism  mesh terms  or  somnambulism  all fields  or   sleep  all fields  and  walking  all fields   or  sleep walking  all fields  
likewise 
heart attack aspirin prevention is translated as   myocardial infarction  mesh terms  or   myocardial  all fields  and  infarction  all fields   or  myocardial infarction  all fields  or   heart  all fields  and  attack  all fields   or  heart attack  all fields   and   aspirin  mesh terms  or  aspirin  all fields   and   prevention and control  subheading  or   prevention  all fields  and  control  all fields   or  prevention and control  all fields  or  prevention  all fields  
the new pubmed interface  launched in october 2009  encourages the use of such quick  google-like search formulations  they have also been described as  telegram  searches 
comprehensive searches  
for comprehensive  optimal searches in pubmed  it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of its core component  medline  and especially of the mesh  medical subject headings  controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles  they may also require complex search strategies  use of field names  tags   proper use of limits and other features  and are best carried out by pubmed search specialists or librarians  who are able to select the right type of search and carefully adjust it for  
journal article parameters  
when a journal article is indexed  numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information  such parameters are  article type  mesh terms  e g    clinical trial    secondary identifiers   mesh terms   language  country of the journal or publication history  e-publication date  print journal publication date  
publication type  clinical queries systematic reviews  
publication type parameter enables many special features  a special feature of pubmed is its  clinical queries  section  where  clinical categories    systematic reviews   and  medical genetics  subjects can be searched  with study-type  filters  automatically applied to identify substantial  robust studies  as these  clinical girish  can generate small sets of robust studies with considerable precision  it has been suggested that this pubmed section can be used as a  point-of-care  resource 
secondary id  
since july 2005  the medline article indexing process extracts important identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called secondary identifier  si   the secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data  gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial ids  for clinical trials  pubmed extracts trial ids for the two largest trial registries  clinicaltrials gov  nct identifier  and the international standard randomized controlled trial number register  irctn identifier

a reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and  related articles  can be identified  if relevant  several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated  on pubmed or any of the other ncbi entrez databases  using the  find related data  option  the related articles are then listed in order of  relatedness   to create these lists of related articles  pubmed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation  as well as the mesh headings assigned  using a powerful word-weighted algorithm  the  related articles  function has been judged to be so precise that some researchers suggest it can be used instead of a full search 
mapping to mesh headings and subheadings  
a strong feature of pubmed is its ability to automatically link to mesh terms and subheadings  examples would be   bad breath  links to  and includes in the search   halitosis    heart attack  to  myocardial infarction    breast cancer  to  breast neoplasms   where appropriate  these mesh terms are automatically  expanded   that is  include more specific terms  terms like  nursing  are automatically linked to  nursing  mesh   or  nursing  subheading    this important feature makes pubmed searches automatically more sensitive and avoids false-negative  missed  hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology 
my ncbi  
the pubmed optional facility  my ncbi   with free registration  provides tools for
saving searches
filtering search results
setting up automatic updates sent by e-mail
saving sets of references retrieved as part of a pubmed search
configuring display formats or highlighting search terms
and a wide range of other options  the  my ncbi  area can be accessed from any computer with web-access  an earlier version of  my ncbi  was called  pubmed cubby  
linkout  
linkout  a nlm facility to link  and make available full-text  local journal holdings  some 3,200 sites  mainly academic institutions  participate in this nlm facility  as of march 2010   from
in denmark to
in seattle  users at these institutions see their institutions logo within the pubmed search result  if the journal is held at that institution  and can access the full-text 
pubmed commons  
in 2016  pubmed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by pubmed  this feature was initially tested in a pilot mode  since 2013  and was made permanent in 2016 
pubmed for handhelds mobiles  
pubmed medline can be accessed via handheld devices  using for instance the
option  for focused clinical questions  created by the nlm  a  pubmed mobile  option  providing access to a mobile friendly  simplified pubmed version  is also available 
askmedline  
askmedline  a free-text  natural language query tool for medline pubmed  developed by the nlm  also suitable for handhelds 
pubmed identifier  
for help using pubmed identifiers within wikipedia  see  
a pmid  pubmed identifier or pubmed unique identifier  is a   starting at 1  assigned to each pubmed record  a pmid is not the same as a pmcid which is the identifier for all works published in the free-to-access  
the assignment of a pmid or pmcid to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content  pmids are assigned to   editorial opinions 
columns  and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal  as well as peer-reviewed papers  the existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been
for fraud  incompetence  or misconduct  the announcement about any
to original papers may be assigned a pmid 
alternative interfaces  
the national library of medicine leases the medline information to a number of private vendors such as      
and many other commercial  non-commercial  and academic providers  as of october 2008  more than 500 licenses had been issued  more than 200 of them to providers outside the united states  as licenses to use medline data are available for free  the nlm in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to pubmed  one of a very few large  professionally curated databases which offers this option 
lu identifies a sample of 28 current and free web-based pubmed versions  requiring no installation or registration  which are grouped into four categories 
ranking search results  for instance      medlineranker  misearch 
clustering results by topics  authors  journals etc   for instance    clustermed 
enhancing semantics and visualization  for instance  ebimed  medevi 
 note  citexplore was withdrawn from service on 15 february 2013  replaced by   
improved search interface and retrieval experience  for instance  askmedline babelmesh  and pubcrawler 
is a knowledge-based   and   search engine for pubmed 
claims to be a semantic search engine  but searches return exactly the same results as pubmed itself 
expertscape provides search and ranking of medical and biomedical expertise by specific diagnosis  technique  or other terminology  results are based on analysis derived from most recent ten years of pubmed data 
search term forwarders like   o  groth   which runs searches on multiple external platforms derived from the original boolean search terms 
reference-to-pubmed transcriptors like   o  groth   which retrieves the pmid from one-letter coded journal abbreviations to get the full-text articles 
link-out arborizers   o  groth   which tries to retrieve available pdf s from additional hosts 
as most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on pubmed medline data leased under license from the nlm pubmed  the term  pubmed derivatives  has been suggested  without the need to store about 90gb of original pubmed datasets  anybody can write pubmed applications using the eutils-application program interface as described in  the e-utilities in-depth  parameters  syntax and more   by eric sayers  phd
