a rolling blackout  also referred to as rotational load shedding or feeder rotation  is an intentionally engineered electrical power shutdown where electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region  rolling blackouts are a last-resort measure used by an
company to avoid a total blackout of the power system  they are a type of
for a situation where the demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network  rolling blackouts may be localised to a specific part of the electricity network or may be more widespread and affect entire countries and continents  rolling blackouts generally result from two causes  insufficient
capacity or inadequate
infrastructure to deliver sufficient power to the area where it is needed 
rolling blackouts are a common or even a normal daily event in many
where electricity generation capacity is underfunded or
is poorly managed  rolling blackouts in
are rare because demand is accurately forecasted  adequate infrastructure investment is scheduled and networks are well managed  such events are considered an unacceptable failure of planning and can cause significant political damage to responsible governments  in well managed under-capacity systems  blackouts are scheduled in advance and advertised to allow people to work around them  but in most cases they happen without warning  typically whenever the transmission frequency falls below the  safe  limit  rolling blackouts are also used as a response strategy to cope with reduced output beyond reserve capacity from power stations taken offline unexpectedly such as through an extreme weather event

canada  
in january 2014  the canadian province of newfoundland   labrador renewed rolling blackouts to compensate for the cascading failure of the holyrood generating station after a fire at the sunnyside substation on jan 4 following a blizzard  the rolling blackouts started before the storm on the 4th  rather were caused by extreme cold weather and a high demand for power at the time 
on 9 july 2012  the
ordered
to institute rolling blackouts during a heat wave as six generating plants failed during peak demand in the heat of the afternoon  because the shortage increased the amount consumers paid to generators  members of the
voiced concerns that price manipulation might have been involved 
in both cases the blackouts were rolled fairly rapidly  so that no area had to spend more than one hour without power 
egypt  
summer blackouts have been common in egypt since 2010 but became more severe and widespread after the   in april 2014  the minister of electricity and renewable energy said that the problem would take a few years to resolve  the government is blaming the unrest the country is experiencing for the blackouts  however  blame between different ministries reveals their poor organization  some also point to the fact that the infrastructure is old and lacks maintenance

due to a chronic shortage of electricity 
are common throughout india  adversely affecting the country s potential for economic growth  even in the country s capital of   rolling blackouts are common  especially during the hot summer season when demand far outstrips supply capacity  rural areas are the most severely affected  it is common for the 14  of rural households having access to electricity to lose power for more than 2 hours each day  the states periodically and chronically affected by load-shedding are              
and   the states of    
and
are largely free of any load-shedding due to surplus power

japan instituted rolling blackouts starting on 14 march 2011 due to power shortages caused by the   the   which normally provides approximately 40,000 mw of electricity  announced that it could only provide about 30,000 mw  a shortfall of 25 percent  this is because about 40 percent of the electricity used in the greater tokyo area is supplied by
plants in the

main article 
rolling blackouts began nationwide in
in early 2008 with the resurgence of democracy and presently continue in 2015  it intensifies in the long summers  with many places around the country having no electricity for 6 hours per day  according to pakistan electric power company  pepco   pakistan s electricity shortfall is normally 2,500 megawatts  mw  but reaches around 6,000 mw or more during the summer season  the country s electricity problems are so severe that violent riots sometimes take place in some regions  including   the country s most populous province 
poland  
during the period of soviet-controlled
rolling blackouts begun in 1976 due to economic crisis poland was suffering then  the point of rolling blackouts was to spare the energy for key industry sectors  which were hoped to help the economy  however  due to poor management  which contributed to the crisis in the first place  the planned outages were barely synchronised with the industry requirements  therefore most of the effort was in fact wasted  with decreasing frequency  the rolling blackouts were performed till the half of 1980s  since then polish economy improved as well as the capability of the national grid 
rolling blackouts have occurred unexpectedly in late july 2015 due to extremely hot weather which made the power stations to reduce their output  there is possibility that rolling blackouts may occur in the following summers for the same reason  however  contrary to 1970/80s outages  in these emergency blackouts the industry is cut off first  the power flow to the houses is usually uninterrupted 
south africa  
there is a long history of rolling blackouts in south africa  with multiple causes  in south africa the major producer and distributor of electricity is   which provides over 95  of the country s energy usage  during the 1980s eskom mothballed three of their coal-fired power stations  as there was an excess of
capacity at the time  with the demise of
in the 1990s came massive investment and economic growth  at the same time the government tried to deregulate the electricity supply industry by inviting the
to build new power stations to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity  eskom was at the time prevented from building new power stations  including de-mothballing the three existing power stations  or from strengthening the transmission network  the transmission network is especially important in delivering power from   where the majority of the power stations are located  to other parts of the country such as
and the   with no bidders coming forward to construct new power stations  there was effectively no investment into new generation plants during the early 1990s  which eventually led to the shortage of capacity that was experienced in the 2000s 
in 1998  the department of minerals and energy released a detailed energy review in which it explicitly warned that unless  timely steps were taken to ensure that demand does not exceed available supply capacity   generating capacity would reach its limit by 2007 
country-wide blackouts 20072008  
with the freeze on any new developments being placed on eskom during the early 1990s  south africa was faced with a situation where for the next few years the electricity demand kept rising  without any new power stations being built to keep up the necessary supply  by october 2007 the situation had deteriorated to such an extent that eskom implemented rolling blackouts throughout the country  blackouts occurred in most suburbs throughout the country for a period of two hours at a time 
the situation came to a head on 24 january 2008 when the national grid was brought to near collapse  multiple trips at a number of different power stations rapidly reduced the available supply  resulting in eskom declaring
and instructing its largest industrial customers  mainly gold and platinum mining companies  to shut down their operations and reduce consumption to  minimal levels   just sufficient to evacuate workers that were still in the mines 
in january 2008  with no short- or medium-term relief available to ease the power shortages  eskom warned the public that the country s electricity demand would exceed the supply until 2013  when the first new power stations would be brought online  
eskom also began recommissioning older power stations which had been
in earlier decades 
country-wide blackouts 2014-2015  
load shedding was reintroduced in early november 2014  the majuba power plant lost its capacity to generate power after a collapse of one of its coal storage silos on 1 november 2014  the majuba power plant delivered approximately 10  of the country s entire capacity and the collapse halted the delivery of coal to the plant  a second silo developed a major crack on 20 november causing the shut down of the plant again  this was after temporary measures were instated to deliver coal to the plant 
on 5 december  eskom launched a major stage three load shedding in south africa after the shut down of two power plants on thursday 4 november 2014 due to diesel shortages  it was also reported that the palmiet and drakenburg stations were also experiencing difficulties due to a depletion of water reserve to the hydro plants  on thursday 4 november  eskom fell 4,000mw short of the electricity countries demand of 28,000mw  the power utility has the ability to produce 45,583mw  but could only supply 24,000mw due to  planned and unplanned  maintenance  one turbine at eskoms
is also currently   out of commission due to an  unexplained incident  in march 2014

texas  
in february 2011  north and central texas experienced rolling blackouts due to 50 power plants tripping offline  temperatures ranged between 8 and 19f  13 and 7c   the coldest in 15 years  the time of the power outages ranged from twenty minutes to over eight hours  areas affected included bell  bexar  brazos  collin  comal  dallas  delta  denton  el paso  fort bend  guadalupe  harris  hays  hill  hidalgo  hunt  mclennan  montgomery  navarro  palacios  smith  tarrant  travis  webb and williamson counties  as well as some counties in new mexico  including doa ana  otero  and eddy counties 
the 2006 and 2011 blackouts were the only two to occur in two decades 
california  
though the term did not enter popular use in the u s  until the
of the early 2000s  outages had indeed occurred previously  the outages were almost always triggered by unusually hot temperatures during the summer  which causes a surge in demand due to heavy use of   however  in 2004  taped conversations of
traders became public  showing that traders were purposely manipulating the supply of electricity to raise energy prices 
on 13 december 2003  shortly before leaving office  governor
officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on 17 january 2001  the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies  the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants  during that time  california issued licenses to 38 new power plants  amounting to the addition of 14,365 megawatts of electricity production when completed
