european policy-makers originally increased the eu s capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem 
and competitive distortions in the common market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state  in subsequent years  the environment became a formal policy area  with its own policy actors  principles and procedures  the legal basis for eu environmental policy was established with the introduction of the single european act in 1987

further information 
political system of the european union
the classification of the eu in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated  it began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a
of states  however  since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a   such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual and majority voting in the decision-making process of the general level of government  without becoming a federation per se  scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation  being an instance of neither political structure  for this reason  the organisation is termed
 incomparable  one of a kind   although some argue that this designation is no longer valid 
the organisation has traditionally used the terms  community  and later  union  to describe itself  the difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law  where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations  and
 where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations   they can also be seen in the light of differing european and american constitutional traditions  especially in terms of the european tradition  the term federation is equated with a sovereign
in international law  so the eu cannot be called a federation  at least  not without qualification  it is  however  described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature  and so it may be appropriate to consider it a   a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state  the german constitutional court refers to the eu as a   an intermediate structure between the staatenbund  confederation of states  and the bundesstaat  federal state   consistent with this concept  this may be a long-lived political form  professor andrew moravcsik claims that the eu is unlikely to develop further into a federal state  but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system

competences
eu member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the european union  in some areas the eu enjoys exclusive competence  these are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation  in other areas the eu and its member states share the competence to legislate  while both can legislate  member states can only legislate to the extent to which the eu has not  in other policy areas the eu can only co-ordinate  support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws 
that a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what
is used for enacting legislation within that policy area  different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence  and even with the same policy area 
the distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided in the following three categories 
as outlined in
exclusive competence
shared competence
supporting competence
 the union has exclusive competence to make directives and conclude international agreements when provided for in a union legislative act

the   seated in  
the eu is based on a series of   these first established the european community and the eu  and then made amendments to those founding treaties  these are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals  these legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants  the eu has   with the right to sign agreements and international treaties 
under the principle of   national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified  and thus the laws enacted under them  even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law  and  within limits  even constitutional provisions 
courts of justice
the
of the euformally called the consists of three courts  the   the   and the   together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the eu 
the court of justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states  the institutions  and
by the courts of member states  the general court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the eu s courts  and the european union civil service tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the european union and   decisions from the general court can be appealed to the court of justice but only on a point of law 
fundamental rights
the ceremony of the 1990
awarded to
by   inside the parliament s strasbourg hemicycle  in 2013 
the treaties declare that the eu itself is  founded on the values of respect for     democracy    the
and respect for human rights  including the rights of persons belonging to     in a society in which pluralism  non-discrimination  tolerance  justice  solidarity and equality between women and men prevail  
in 2009 the
gave legal effect to the   the charter is a codified catalogue of
against which the eu s legal acts can be judged  it consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the court of justice and derived from the  constitutional traditions common to the member states   the court of justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has  on occasion  invalidated eu legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights 
although signing the
 echr  is a condition for eu membership  previously  the eu itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state nor had the competence to accede  the lisbon treaty and protocol 14 to the echr have changed this  the former binds the eu to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it 
although  the eu is independent from council of europe  they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law  human rights and democracy  further
and   the
of
are created by council of europe  the eu also promoted human rights issues in the wider world  the eu opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition  abolition of the death penalty is a condition for eu membership 
acts
the main legal acts of the eu come in three forms      and   regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force  without the requirement for any implementing measures  and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions  directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result  the details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states  when the time limit for implementing directives passes  they may  under certain conditions  have
in national law against member states 
decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation  they are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals  companies or a particular member state  they are most often used in   or on rulings on state aid  but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions  regulations  directives  and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy 
area of freedom  security and justice
further information 
the borders inside the
between germany and austria
since the creation of the eu in 1993  it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom  security and justice  initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism  to this end  agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions 
for co-operation of police forces 
for co-operation between prosecutors  and
for co-operation between border control authorities  the eu also operates the
which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities  this co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the
and the associated cross border crime 
furthermore  the union has legislated in areas such as   family law  asylum law  and criminal justice  prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties  in more recent years  these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race  religion  disability  age  and sexual orientation  by virtue of these powers  the eu has enacted legislation on

main articles      and

which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies  it was not  however  until 1987 when european political cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the   epc was renamed as the
 cfsp  by the  
 
the aims of the cfsp are to promote both the eu s own interests and those of the
as a whole  including the furtherance of international co-operation  respect for human rights  democracy  and the rule of law  the cfsp requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue  the unanimity and difficult issues treated under the cfsp sometimes lead to disagreements  such as those which occurred over the  
the coordinator and representative of the cfsp within the eu is the
who speaks on behalf of the eu in foreign policy and defence matters  and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment  the high representative heads up the
 eeas   a unique eu department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 december 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the   the eeas will serve as a foreign ministry and
for the european union 
besides the emerging international policy of the european union  the international influence of the eu is also felt through   the perceived benefits of becoming a member of the eu act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the eu s accession criteria  and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of european formerly communist countries  762 this influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as     as opposed to military  hard power

the policy s

of products bought up by the community to maintain minimum price levels  to dispose of surplus stores  they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below community guaranteed prices  or farmers were offered subsidies  amounting to the difference between the community and world prices  to export their products outside the community  this system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside europe  especially those in the   supporters of cap argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living

health care in the eu is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level  the systems are primarily
through taxation  universal health care   private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private  non-subsidised  health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance   
all eu and many other european countries offer their citizens a free
