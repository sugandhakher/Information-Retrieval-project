fork trucks  
a hice forklift or hice lift truck is a hydrogen fueled  -powered industrial
used for lifting and
materials  the first production hice forklift truck based on the linde x39 diesel was presented at an exposition in
on may 27  2008  it used a 2.0 litre  43kw  58hp  diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and  
a
 also called a fuel cell lift truck or a fuel cell forklift  is a fuel cell powered industrial forklift truck  in 2013 there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in
in the us  only 500 of these received funding from
in 2012  the global market is 1 million fork lifts per year  as of 2013  fuel cell fleets are being operated by several of companies  including sysco foods  fedex freight  genco  at wegmans  coca-cola  kimberly clark  and whole foods   and h-e-b grocers  a total of 30 fuel cell forklifts with hylift were demonstrated in europe and extended it with hylift-europe to 200 units  with other projects in france and   pike research stated in 2011 that fuel-cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020 
most companies in europe and the us do not use petroleum powered forklifts  as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts  fuel-cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery powered forklifts as they can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes  fuel cell-powered forklifts can be used in refrigerated warehouses  as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures  the fc units are often designed as drop-in replacements 
rockets  
many large
use
as fuel  with
as an oxidizer  an advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high
compared to   or   engines  according to the   a rocket with higher exhaust velocity needs less propellant mass to achieve a given change of speed  before combustion  the hydrogen runs through cooling pipes around the
to protect the nozzle from damage by the hot exhaust gases  also the energy content or
of hydrogen calculated from weight is the best compared to any other chemical energy storage  in combination with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen  liquid hydrogen yields the highest specific impulse  or efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed  of any known rocket propellant 
a disadvantage of lh2 lox engines are the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen  which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed  this increases the rocket s structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly  another disadvantage is the poor storability of lh2 lox-powered rockets  due to the constant hydrogen boil-off  the rocket can only be fueled shortly before launch  which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for
and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations 
overall  the delta-v of a hydrogen stage is typically not much different from that of a dense fuelled stage  however  the weight of a hydrogen stage is much less  which makes it particularly effective for upper stages  since they are carried by the lower stages  for first stages  dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage  due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag 
liquid hydrogen and oxygen were also used in the
to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems  the byproduct of the fuel cell is water  which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space 
internal combustion vehicle  
main articles 
and
hydrogen internal combustion engine cars are different from hydrogen fuel cell cars  the
is a slightly modified version of the traditional gasoline
car  these hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do  the main difference is the exhaust product  gasoline combustion results in

fuel cell cost  
hydrogen fuel cells are relatively expensive to produce  as their designs require rare substances such as
as a   in 2014  toyota said it would introduce its
in japan for less than  70,000 in 2015  former european parliament president
estimates that toyota will initially lose about  100,000 on each mirai sold 
freezing conditions  
the problems in early fuel cell designs at low temperatures concerning range and cold start capabilities have been addressed so that they  cannot be seen as show-stoppers anymore   users in 2014 said that their fuel cell vehicles perform flawlessly in temperatures below zero  even with the heaters blasting  without significantly reducing range 
service life  
the service life of fuel cells is comparable to that of other vehicles  pem
is 7,300 hours under cycling conditions 
hydrogen  
hydrogen does not come as a pre-existing source of
like   but is first produced and then stored as a carrier  much like a   a suggested benefit of large-scale deployment of hydrogen vehicles is that it could lead to decreased emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone precursors  however  as of 2014  95  of hydrogen is made from methane  it can be produced using renewable sources  but that is an expensive process  integrated wind-to-hydrogen    plants  using   are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough  and quantities great enough  to compete with traditional energy sources 
according to ford motor company   when fcvs are run on hydrogen reformed from natural gas using this process  they do not provide significant environmental benefits on a well-to-wheels basis  due to ghg emissions from the natural gas reformation process    while methods of hydrogen production that do not use fossil fuel would be more sustainable  currently renewable energy represents only a small percentage of energy generated  and power produced from renewable sources can be used in electric vehicles and for non-vehicle applications 
the challenges facing the use of hydrogen in vehicles include production  storage  transport and distribution  the well-to-wheel efficiency for hydrogen is less than 25   a study sponsored by the u s  department of energy said in 2004 that the well-to-wheel efficiency of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles is even less 
production  
for more details on this topic  see  
the molecular hydrogen needed as an on-board fuel for hydrogen vehicles can be obtained through many thermochemical methods utilizing  
 by a process known as coal gasification    
    by a process called   or as a microbial waste product called
or   95  of hydrogen is produced using natural gas  and 85  of hydrogen produced is used to remove sulfur from gasoline  hydrogen can also be produced from
by
at working efficiencies in the 5060  range for the smaller electrolysers and around 6570  for the larger plants  hydrogen can also be made by chemical reduction using chemical hydrides or aluminum  current technologies for manufacturing hydrogen use energy in various forms  totaling between 25 and 50 percent of the
of the hydrogen fuel  used to produce  compress or liquefy  and transmit the hydrogen by pipeline or truck 
environmental consequences of the production of hydrogen from fossil energy resources include the emission of   a consequence that would also result from the on-board reforming of methanol into hydrogen  analyses comparing the environmental consequences of hydrogen production and use in fuel-cell vehicles to the refining of petroleum and combustion in conventional automobile engines do not agree on whether a net reduction of ozone and greenhouse gases would result  hydrogen production using renewable energy resources would not create such emissions  but the scale of renewable energy production would need to be expanded to be used in producing hydrogen for a significant part of transportation needs  as of 2015  33 percent of u s  electricity was produced from renewable sources  including 7  from hydro and 20  from nuclear   in a few countries  renewable sources are being used more widely to produce energy and hydrogen  for example

or dedicated onsite production 
according to gm  70  of the u s  population lives near a hydrogen-generating facility but has little access to hydrogen  despite its wide availability for commercial use  the distribution of hydrogen fuel for vehicles throughout the u s  would require new hydrogen stations that would cost  by some estimates approximately 20 billion dollars and 4.6 billion in the eu  other estimates place the cost as high as half trillion dollars in the united states alone 
as of 2016  there are 23 publicly accessible

codes and standards  
  as well as codes and technical standards for
and the   have been identified as an institutional barrier to deploying
and developing a   to enable the commercialization of hydrogen in consumer products  new codes and standards must be developed and adopted by federal  state and local governments 
official support  
us initiatives  
in 2003 
announced an initiative to promote hydrogen powered vehicles  in 2009  president obama and his department of energy secretary
stripped the funding of fuel cell technology due to their belief that the technology was still decades away  under heavy criticism  the funding was partially restored  in 2014 the obama administration announced they want to speed up production and development of hydrogen powered vehicles  the press release states that  by partnering with a private sector  the obama administration thinks that it can create success stories and help speed up the process  the department of energy is spreading a  7.2 million investment to the states of georgia  kansas  pennsylvania  and tennessee to support projects that fuel vehicles and support power systems  companies like the center for transportation and the environment  fed ex express  air products and chemicals  and sprint are invested in the development of these fuel cells  fuel cells could also be used in handling equipment such as forklifts as well as telecommunications infrastructure 
senator byron l  dorgan stated in 2013  the energy and water appropriations bill makes investments in our nations efforts to develop safe  homegrown energy sources that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil  and  because ongoing research and development is necessary to develop game-changing technologies  this bill also restores funding for hydrogen energy research  much work has been done in developing these fuel cell cars  the u s  department of energy supports next generation fuel cell systems and they are the nations lead innovative clean energy technologies  in june 2013 the doe gave 9 million dollars in grants to speed up the technology and another 4.5 million for advanced fuel cell membranes   3 million for minnesota-based 3m to work on membranes with improved durability and performance  and 1.5 million for the colorado school of mines for work on simpler and more affordable fuel cell membranes

norway plans a series of hydrogen refueling stations along the main roads 
criticism  
critics claim the time frame for overcoming the technical and economic challenges to implementing wide-scale use of hydrogen cars is likely to last for at least several decades  and hydrogen vehicles may never become broadly available  they claim that the focus on the use of the hydrogen car is a dangerous detour from more readily available solutions to reducing the use of fossil fuels in vehicles  in may 2008 
reported that  experts say it will be 40 years or more before hydrogen has any meaningful impact on gasoline consumption or global warming  and we can t afford to wait that long  in the meantime  fuel cells are diverting resources from more immediate solutions  
k  g  duleep commented that  a strong case exists for continuing
improvements from conventional technology at relatively low cost   critiques of hydrogen vehicles are presented in the 2006 documentary    according to former
official    a hydrogen car is one of the least efficient  most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases   asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available  romm replied   not in our lifetime  and very possibly never   the los angeles times wrote  in february 2009   hydrogen fuel-cell technology won t work in cars      any way you look at it  hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars  
magazine  in september 2008  quoted   the author of   as saying   hydrogen is  just about the worst possible vehicle fuel    the magazine noted the withdrawal of california from earlier goals   in march  2008  the   an agency of california s state government and a bellwether for state governments across america  changed its requirement for the number of
 zevs  to be built and sold in california between 2012 and 2014  the revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles   the magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation  which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today s gasoline cars  on the other hand  if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy   it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles  
asked in november 2009   but why would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor  when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over america and stored in auto batteries    a december 2009 study at   published in the journal of power sources  found that  over their lifetimes  hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles  this agrees with a 2014 analysis 
stated in 2013 that  there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles  for hydrogen cars  relating to transportation  storage  and  most importantly  production  
volkswagen s rudolf krebs said in 2013 that  no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves  the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency  the most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity   he elaborated   hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy   but     you need to convert it first into hydrogen  with low efficiencies  where  you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy   you then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks  which uses more energy   and then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss   krebs continued   in the end  from your original 100 percent of electric energy  you end up with 30 to 40 percent  
commented 
pure hydrogen can be industrially derived  but it takes energy  if that energy does not come from renewable sources  then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem      another challenge is the lack of infrastructure  gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before fcevs become practical  and it s unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today      compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology  fuel cells are  still very  very expensive  
in 2014  joseph romm devoted three articles to updating his critiques of hydrogen vehicles  he states that fcvs still have not overcome the following issues  high cost of the vehicles  high fueling cost  and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure   it would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades   most importantly  he says   fcvs aren t green  because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced  as 95  of it is  using the steam reforming process  he concludes that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an fcv fleet  either now or in the future    s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014  in 2015  clean technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles  so did   another clean technica writer concluded   while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage  especially seasonal storage   it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles

main article 
a 2008 technology review article stated   electric carsand plug-in hybrid carshave an enormous advantage over hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in utilizing low-carbon electricity  that is because of the inherent inefficiency of the entire hydrogen fueling process  from generating the hydrogen with that electricity to transporting this diffuse gas long distances  getting the hydrogen in the car  and then running it through a fuel cellall for the purpose of converting the hydrogen back into electricity to drive the same exact electric motor you ll find in an electric car   thermodynamically  each additional step in the conversion process decreases the overall efficiency of the process 
a 2013 comparison of hydrogen and
agreed with the 25  figure from ulf bossel in 2006 and stated that the cost of an
 is rapidly coming down  and the gap will widen further   while there is little  existing infrastructure to transport  store and deliver hydrogen to vehicles and would cost billions of dollars to put into place  everyone s household power sockets are  electric vehicle refueling  station and the  cost of electricity  depending on the source  is at least 75  cheaper than hydrogen   in 2013 the
and doe stated that even under optimistic conditions by 2030 the price for the battery is not expected to go below  17,000   200 250 kwh  on 300 miles of range  in 2013 matthew mench  from the
stated  if we are sitting around waiting for a battery breakthrough that will give us four times the range than we have now  we are going to be waiting for a long time   navigant research   formerly pike research   on the other hand  forecasts that lithium-ion costs  which are tipping the scales at about  500 per kilowatt hour now  could fall to  300 by 2015 and to  180 by 2020  in 2013 takeshi uchiyamada  a designer of the
stated   because of its shortcomings  driving range  cost and recharging time  the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars  
many
designs offer limited driving range causing   for example  the 2013

has an estimated range of 115mi  185km  and the
has a range of up to 265mi  426km   however  most us commutes are 3040 miles  4864km  miles per day round trip and in europe most commutes are around 20 kilometres  12mi  round-trip
in 2013  the new york times stated that there are only 10 publicly accessible hydrogen filling stations in the u s   eight of which are in southern california  and that bevs  cost-per-mile expense in 2013 is one-third as much as hydrogen cars  when comparing electricity from the grid and hydrogen at a filling station  the times commented   by the time toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan  there will be about a half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the united states  and tens of thousands of e v  charging stations   in 2013 john swanton of the   who sees them as complementary technologies  stated that evs have the jump on fuel-cell autos  which  are like electric vehicles were 10 years ago  evs are for real consumers  no strings attached  with evs you have a lot of infrastructure in place    in 2013 commented that if the energy to produce hydrogen  does not come from renewable sources  then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem      gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before fcevs become practical  and it s unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today      compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology  fuel cells are  still very  very expensive   even compared to battery-powered evs
