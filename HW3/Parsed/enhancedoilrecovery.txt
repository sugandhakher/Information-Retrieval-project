injection well used for enhanced oil recovery
enhanced oil recovery  abbreviated eor  is the implementation of various techniques for increasing the amount of
that can be extracted from an   enhanced oil recovery is also called improved oil recovery or tertiary recovery  as opposed to primary and secondary recovery   according to the us department of energy  there are three primary techniques for eor  thermal recovery  gas injection  and chemical injection  sometimes the term quaternary recovery is used to refer to more advanced  speculative  eor techniques  using eor  30 to 60 percent  or more  of the reservoir s original oil can be extracted  compared with 20 to 40 percent using

techniques  
there are three primary techniques of eor  gas injection  thermal injection  and chemical injection  gas injection  which uses gases such as     or
 co2   accounts for nearly 60 percent of eor production in the united states  thermal injection  which involves the introduction of heat  accounts for 40 percent of eor production in the united states  with most of it occurring in california  chemical injection  which can involve the use of long-chained molecules called
to increase the effectiveness of waterfloods  accounts for about one percent of eor production in the united states  in 2013  a technique called plasma-pulse technology was introduced into the united states from russia  this technique can result in another 50 percent of improvement in existing well production 
gas injection  
gas injection or miscible flooding is presently the most-commonly used approach in enhanced oil recovery  miscible flooding is a general term for injection processes that introduce miscible gases into the reservoir  a miscible displacement process maintains reservoir pressure and improves oil displacement because the interfacial tension between oil and water is reduced  this refers to removing the interface between the two interacting fluids  this allows for total displacement efficiency  gases used include  
or   the fluid most commonly used for miscible displacement is carbon dioxide because it reduces the oil
and is less expensive than liquefied petroleum gas  oil displacement by
relies on the phase behavior of the mixtures of that gas and the crude  which are strongly dependent on reservoir temperature  pressure and crude oil composition 
thermal injection  
main article 
the steam flooding technique
in this approach  various methods are used to heat the crude oil in the formation to reduce its viscosity and or vaporize part of the oil and thus decrease the mobility ratio  the increased heat reduces the surface tension and increases the permeability of the oil  the heated oil may also vaporize and then condense forming improved oil  methods include  
and combustion  these methods improve the sweep efficiency and the displacement efficiency  steam injection has been used commercially since the 1960s in california fields  in 2011
projects were started in california and   this method is similar to thermal eor but uses a solar array to produce the steam 
in july 2015 
and
announced that they signed a  600 million agreement to build a 1 gwth solar field on the amal oilfield  the project  named   will be the world s largest solar field measured by peak thermal capacity 
steam flooding  
steam flooding  see sketch  is one means of introducing heat to the reservoir by pumping steam into the well with a pattern similar to that of water injection  eventually the steam condenses to hot water  in the steam zone the oil evaporates  and in the hot water zone the oil expands  as a result  the oil expands  the viscosity drops  and the permeability increases  to ensure success the process has to be cyclical  this is the principal enhanced oil recovery program in use today 
is a form of steam flooding that uses
to concentrate the suns energy to heat water and generate steam  solar eor is proving to be a viable alternative to gas-fired steam production for the  
solar enhanced oil recovery site
fire flooding  
fire flooding works best when the oil saturation and porosity are high  combustion generates the heat within the reservoir itself  continuous injection of air or other gas mixture with high oxygen content will maintain the flame front  as the fire burns  it moves through the reservoir toward production wells  heat from the fire reduces oil viscosity and helps vaporize reservoir water to steam  the steam  hot water  combustion gas and a bank of distilled solvent all act to drive oil in front of the fire toward production wells 
there are three methods of combustion  dry forward  reverse and wet combustion  dry forward uses an igniter to set fire to the oil  as the fire progresses the oil is pushed away from the fire toward the producing well  in reverse the air injection and the ignition occur from opposite directions  in wet combustion water is injected just behind the front and turned into steam by the hot rock  this quenches the fire and spreads the heat more evenly 
chemical injection  
the injection of various chemicals  usually as dilute solutions  have been used to aid mobility and the reduction in   injection of
or
solutions into reservoirs with oil that have
naturally occurring in the oil will result in the production of
that may lower the
enough to increase production  injection of a dilute solution of a water-soluble
to increase the
of the injected water can increase the amount of oil recovered in some formations  dilute solutions of
such as petroleum
or
such as
may be injected to lower the
or
that impedes oil droplets from moving through a reservoir  special formulations of oil  water and surfactant    can be particularly effective in this  application of these methods is usually limited by the cost of the chemicals and their adsorption and loss onto the rock of the oil containing formation  in all of these methods the chemicals are injected into several wells and the production occurs in other nearby wells 
polymer flooding  
polymer flooding consists in mixing long chain polymer molecules with the injected water in order to increase the water viscosity  this method improves the vertical and areal sweep efficiency as a consequence of improving the water oil mobility ratio 
surfactants may be used in conjunction with polymers  they decrease the surface tension between the oil and water  this reduces the residual oil saturation and improves the macroscopic efficiency of the process 
primary surfactants usually have co-surfactants  activity boosters  and co-solvents added to them to improve stability of the formulation 
caustic flooding is the addition of
to injection water  it does this by lowering the surface tension  reversing the rock wettability 
of the oil  mobilization of the oil and helps in drawing the oil out of the rock 
is a newly proposed method of chemical enhanced oil recovery  ceor  method  at present  the method is controversial and remains to be proven 
microbial injection  
this section relies too much on
to   please improve this section by adding    october 2012    
microbial injection is part of
and is rarely used because of its higher cost and because the
is not widely accepted  these
function either by partially digesting long
molecules  by generating   or by emitting carbon dioxide  which then functions as described in gas injection above  
three approaches have been used to achieve microbial injection  in the first approach  bacterial cultures mixed with a food source  a carbohydrate such as
is commonly used  are injected into the oil field  in the second approach  used since 1985  nutrients are injected into the ground to nurture existing microbial bodies  these nutrients cause the bacteria to increase production of the natural surfactants they normally use to metabolize crude oil underground  after the injected nutrients are consumed  the microbes go into near-shutdown mode  their exteriors become   and they migrate to the oil-water interface area  where they cause oil droplets to form from the larger oil mass  making the droplets more likely to migrate to the wellhead  this approach has been used in oilfields near the
and in the
in  
the third approach is used to address the problem of
components of the crude oil  which tend to precipitate as the crude flows to the surface  since the earth s surface is considerably cooler than the petroleum deposits  a temperature drop of 9-10-14c per thousand feet of depth is usual  
liquid carbon dioxide superfluids  
main article 
carbon dioxide is particularly effective in reservoirs deeper than 2,000ft   where co2 will be in a
state  in high pressure applications with lighter oils 
is miscible with the oil  with resultant swelling of the oil  and reduction in viscosity  and possibly also with a reduction in the surface tension with the reservoir rock  in the case of low pressure reservoirs or heavy oils 
will form an immiscible fluid  or will only partially mix with the oil  some oil swelling may occur  and oil viscosity can still be significantly reduced 
in these applications  between one-half and two-thirds of the injected co2 returns with the produced oil and is usually re-injected into the reservoir to minimize operating costs  the remainder is trapped in the oil reservoir by various means  carbon dioxide as a solvent has the benefit of being more economical than other similarly miscible fluids such as
and  
plasma-pulse  
plasma-pulse technology is the newest technique used in the usa as of 2013    the technology originated in the russian federation at the st  petersburg state mining university with funding and assistance from the   the development team in russia and deployment teams across russia  europe and now the usa have tested this technology in vertical wells with nearly 90  of wells showing positive effects   
the plasma-pulse oil well eor uses low energy emissions to create the same effect that many other technologies can produce except without negative ecological impact    in nearly every case the volume of water pulled with the oil is actually reduced from pre-eor treatment instead of increased    current clients and users of the new technology include      
and    
it is based in the same technology as the russian
which was used on two space ships and is currently being advanced for use in horizontal wells   
economic costs and benefits  
adding oil recovery methods adds to the cost of oil in the case of co2 typically between 0.5-8.0 us  per tonne of co2  the increased extraction of oil on the other hand  is an economic benefit with the revenue depending on prevailing   onshore eor has paid in the range of a net 10-16 us  per tonne of co2 injected for oil prices of 15-20 us    prevailing prices depend on many factors but can determine the economic suitability of any procedure  with more procedures and more expensive procedures being economically viable at higher prices  example  with oil prices at around 90 us  barrel  the economic benefit is about 70 us  per tonne co2  the
estimates that 20 billion tons of captured co2 could produce 67 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil 
it is believed that the use of captured    derived from the exploitation of
coal reserves  to drive
and support eor from existing and future oil and gas wells offers a multifaceted solution to u s  energy  environmental  and economic challenges  there is no doubt that
and oil resources are finite  the u s  is in a strong position to leverage such traditional energy sources to supply future power needs while other sources are being explored and developed  for the   co2 eor creates a market for coal
and reduces the costs associated with  
co2 eor projects  
boundary dam  canada  
saskpower s boundary dam project retrofitted its coal-fired power station in 2014 with
 ccs  technology  the plant will capture 1 million tonnes of co2 annually  which it will sell to
for enhanced oil recovery at its weyburn oil field  the project is expected to inject a net 18 million ton co2 and recover an additional 130 million barrels  21,000,000m3  of oil  extending the life of the oil field by 25 years    there is a projected 26  million tonnes  net of production  of co2 to be stored in weyburn  plus another 8.5 million tonnes  net of production  stored at the   resulting in a net reduction in atmospheric co2 by
in the oilfield   that s the equivalent of taking nearly 7 million cars off the road for a year  since co2 injection began in late 2000  the eor project has performed largely as predicted  currently  some 1600 m3  10,063 barrels  per day of incremental oil is being produced from the field 
kemper project  united states  
 s kemper county energy facility  or   is a first-of-its-kind plant in the u s  and is expected to be online in 2015  the
subsidiary has worked with the
and other partners to develop cleaner  less expensive  more reliable methods for producing electricity with coal that also support eor production  for the   rather than burning
directly to make electricity 
technology breaks down the
into   removes
before it is fired  avoids certain emissions  and takes gases that result from this chemical breakdown to fuel the
power plant  this plant  along with others like it  are more efficient and therefore cleaner than traditional coal-fired power plants  additionally  the unique location of the   and its proximity to   makes it an ideal candidate for enhanced oil recovery 
co2 eor in the united states  
the united states has been using co2 eor for several decades  for over 30 years  oil fields in the permian basin have implemented co2 eor using naturally sourced co2 from new mexico and colorado  the department of energy  doe  has estimated that full use of  next generation  co2-eor in united states could generate an additional 240 billion barrels  38km3  of recoverable oil resources  developing this potential would depend on the availability of commercial co2 in large volumes  which could be made possible by widespread use of   for comparison  the total undeveloped us domestic oil resources still in the ground total more than 1 trillion barrels  160km3   most of it remaining unrecoverable  the doe estimates that if the eor potential were to be fully realized  state and local treasuries would gain  280 billion in revenues from future     and state income taxes on oil production  aside from other economic benefits 
the main barrier to taking further advantage of co2 eor in the united states has been an insufficient supply of affordable co2  currently  there is a cost gap between what an oilfield operate could afford to pay for co2 under normal market conditions and the cost to capture and transport co2 from power plants and industrial sources  so most co2 comes from natural sources  however  using co2 from power plants or industrial sources could reduce the carbon footprint  if the co2 is stored underground   for some industrial sources  such as natural gas processing or fertilizer and ethanol production  the cost gap is small  potentially  1020 tonne co2   for other man-made sources of co2  including power generation and a variety of industrial processes  capture costs are greater  and the cost gap becomes much larger  potentially  3050 tonne co2   the enhanced oil recovery initiative has brought together leaders from industry  the environmental community  labor  and state governments to advance co2 eor in the united states and close the price gap 
environmental impacts  
enhanced oil recovery wells typically pump large quantities of
to the surface  this water contains
and may also contain
heavy metals and   this can be very damaging to
sources and the environment generally if not properly controlled  disposal wells are used to prevent surface contamination of soil and water by injecting the produced water deep underground 
in the united states 
activity is regulated by the
 epa  and state governments under the   epa has issued underground injection control  uic  regulations in order to protect drinking water sources  enhanced oil recovery wells are regulated as  class ii  wells by the epa  the regulations require well operators to reinject the brine used for recovery deep underground in class ii disposal wells
