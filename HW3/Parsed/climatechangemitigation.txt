climate change mitigation consists of actions to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term   climate change mitigation generally involves reductions in human    emissions of
 ghgs   mitigation may also be achieved by increasing the capacity of   e g   through   mitigation policies can substantially reduce the risks associated with human-induced global warming 
 mitigation is a public good  climate change is a case of the      effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent  individual  institution or country  acts independently in its own selfish interest  see
and    suggesting the need for collective action  some adaptation actions  on the other hand  have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals  regions  or countries that undertake them  at least in the short term  nevertheless  financing such adaptive activities remains an issue  particularly for poor individuals and countries  
examples of mitigation include
by switching to
sources  such as
and   and expanding forests and other  sinks  to remove greater amounts of
from the atmosphere 
may also play a role  for example  through improving the   another approach to climate change mitigation is  
most countries are parties to the
 unfccc   the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of ghgs at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system  scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change  but deciding which impacts are dangerous requires value judgments 
in 2010  parties to the unfccc agreed that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0c  3.6f  relative to the pre- level  with the
of 2015 this was confirmed  but was revised with a new target laying down  parties will do the best  to achieve warming below 1.5c  the current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2c  other mitigation policies have been proposed  some of which are more stringent or modest than the 2c limit

greenhouse gas concentrations and stabilization

stabilizing co2 emissions at their present level would not stabilize its concentration in the atmosphere 
stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of co2 at a constant level would require emissions to be effectively eliminated 
one of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere  the
 unfccc  has the ultimate objective of   as is stated in article 2 of the convention  this requires that greenhouse gas  ghg  concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where
can adapt naturally to climate change 
is not threatened  and
can proceed in a sustainable fashion 
there are a number of anthropogenic greenhouse gases  these include
   co2

 n
2o   and a group of gases referred to as   the emissions reductions necessary to stabilize the atmospheric concentrations of these gases varies  co2 is the most important of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases  see   
there is a difference between stabilizing co2 emissions and stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of co2  stabilizing emissions of co2 at current levels would not lead to a stabilization in the atmospheric concentration of co2  in fact  stabilizing emissions at current levels would result in the atmospheric concentration of co2 continuing to rise over the 21st century and beyond  see the graphs opposite  
the reason for this is that human activities are adding co2 to the atmosphere far faster than natural processes can remove it  see
for a more complete explanation   this is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub  so long as the tap runs water  analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide  into the tub faster than water escapes through the plughole  the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere   then the level of water in the tub  analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  will continue to rise 
according to some studies  stabilizing atmospheric co2 concentrations would require anthropogenic co2 emissions to be reduced by 80  relative to the peak emissions level  an 80  reduction in emissions would stabilize co2 concentrations for around a century  but even greater reductions would be required beyond this  other research has found that  after leaving room for emissions for food production for 9 billion people and to keep the global temperature rise below 2c  emissions from energy production and transport will have to peak almost immediately in the developed world and decline at ca  10  per annum until zero emissions are reached around 2030  in developing countries energy and transport emissions would have to peak by 2025 and then decline similarly 
stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gases humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere  and how fast the ghgs are removed  stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on  
projections
projections of future greenhouse gas emissions are highly uncertain  in the absence of policies to mitigate climate change  ghg emissions could rise significantly over the 21st century 
numerous assessments have considered how atmospheric ghg concentrations could be stabilized  the lower the desired stabilization level  the sooner global ghg emissions must peak and decline  ghg concentrations are unlikely to stabilize this century without major policy changes

this graph shows the projected contribution of various energy sources to world primary electricity consumption  pec   it is based on a climate change mitigation scenario  in which ghg emissions are substantially reduced over the 21st century  in the scenario  emission reductions are achieved using a portfolio of energy sources  as well as reductions in energy demand  also available in  
assessments often suggest that ghg emissions can be reduced using a portfolio of low-carbon technologies  at the core of most proposals is the reduction of
 ghg  emissions through reducing energy waste and switching to
sources of energy  as the cost of reducing ghg emissions in the
sector appears to be lower than in other sectors  such as in the
sector  the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy 
 economic tools can be useful in designing climate change mitigation policies    while the limitations of economics and social welfare analysis  including costbenefit analysis  are widely documented  economics nevertheless provides useful tools for assessing the pros and cons of taking  or not taking  action on climate change mitigation  as well as of adaptation measures  in achieving competing societal goals  understanding these pros and cons can help in making policy decisions on climate change mitigation and can influence the actions taken by countries  institutions and individuals

sources such as             and  the use of   and   for example  pacala and socolow of princeton have proposed a 15 part program to reduce co2 emissions by 1 billion metric tons per year  or 25 billion tons over the 50-year period using today s technologies as a type of  
another consideration is how future
proceeds  development choices  or  pathways   can lead differences in ghg emissions  political and social attitudes may affect how easy or difficult it is to implement effective policies to reduce emissions

has grown much faster than anyone anticipated  the
 ipcc  has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply 
as of 2012  renewable energy accounts for almost half of new electricity capacity installed and costs are continuing to fall 
and political leadership helps to  level the playing field  and drive the wider acceptance of renewable energy technologies  as of 2011  118 countries have targets for their own renewable energy futures  and have enacted wide-ranging

technologies  nuclear power will continue to play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions  historically  nuclear power usage is estimated to have prevented the atmospheric emission of 64 giga of
as of 2013  public concerns about nuclear power include the         and   of these concerns  nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive fuel  waste  have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide  although generally unaware of it  both of these glaring public concerns are greatly diminished by present
designs  the experimentally proven   melt-down proof    future   and the use of conventional and more advanced fuel  waste    with the latter recycling or
not presently being commonplace as it is often considered to be cheaper to use a once-through

  with a 10.6  share of world electricity production as of 2013  is second only to hydroelectricity as the largest source of low-carbon power  over 400 reactors generate electricity in 31 countries 
a
review published in the journal of industrial ecology analyzing co2  lca  emissions from nuclear power   determined that   the collective lca literature indicates that life cycle
emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies   while some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future ghg emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the   in a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development  as it could be effected by a decreasing global
of average ore grade  the analysis determined that depending on conditions  median life cycle nuclear power ghg emissions could be between 9 and 110 g co2-eq kwh by 2050  with the latter high figure being derived from a  worst-case scenario  that is not  considered very robust  by the authors of the paper  as the  ore grade  in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes 
although this future analyses primarily deals with extrapolations for present
technology  the same paper also summarizes the literature on  fbrs    of which two are in operation as of 2014 with the newest being the   for these reactors it states that the  median life cycle ghg emissions     are  similar to or lower than  present light water reactors

value of 12 g co2-eq kwh  which is the lowest global warming forcing of all
power sources  with comparable low carbon power baseload sources  such as hydropower and biomass  producing substantially more global warming forcing 24 and 230 g co2-eq kwh respectively 
in 2014 
published the net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies which states  after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis  that  the net benefits of new nuclear  hydro  and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants   with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power 
during his
campaign 
stated   nuclear power represents more than 70  of our noncarbon generated electricity  it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option  
this graph illustrates nuclear power is the united states s largest contributor of non-greenhouse-gas-emitting electric power generation  comprising nearly three-quarters of the non-emitting sources 
analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of environmental sustainability
and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely  from the electric grid of the world  has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in france and sweden during each nation s building programs in the 1980s  within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely   allow ing  the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets    in a similar analysis  brook had earlier determined that 50  of all   that is not solely electricity  but transportation
etc  could be generated within approximately 30 years  if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation s already proven decadal rates in units of installed  
per year  per unit of global  gw year    
this is in contrast to the completely conceptual paper-studies for a
world  which would require an
more costly global investment per year  an investment rate that has no historical precedent  having never been attempted due to its prohibitive cost  and with far greater land area that would be required to be devoted to the wind  wave and solar projects  along with the inherent assumption that humanity will use less  and not more  energy in the future  as brook notes the  principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical  economic or fuel-related  but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance  fiscal and political inertia  and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing  the other  low-carbon alternatives  
nuclear power may be uncompetitive compared with fossil fuel energy sources in countries without a
program  and in comparison to a fossil fuel plant of the same power output  nuclear power plants take a longer amount of time to construct 
two new  first of their kind 
reactors under construction in finland and france have been delayed and are running over-budget  however learning from experience  two further epr reactors under construction in china are on  and ahead  of schedule respectively  as of 2013  according to the
and the   worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries  china has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction  as of 2013  with plans to build many more  while in the us the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60years  and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration  there are also a considerable number of new reactors being built in south korea  india  and russia  at least 100 older and smaller reactors will  most probably be closed over the next 1015 years   this is probable only if one does not factor in the ongoing   created to permit the extension of the life span of the usa s 104 nuclear reactors to 60 years  the licenses of almost half of the usa s reactors have been extended to 60years as of 2008  two new   
reactors are  as of 2013  being constructed at  
public opinion about nuclear power varies widely between countries  a poll by gallup international  2011  assessed public opinion in 47 countries  the poll was conducted following a
which caused an
at the fukushima nuclear power plant in japan  49  stated that they held favourable views about nuclear energy  while 43  held an unfavourable view  another global survey by ipsos  2011  assessed public opinion in 24 countries  respondents to this survey showed a clear preference for renewable energy sources over coal and nuclear energy  refer to graph opposite   ipsos  2012  found that solar and wind were viewed by the public as being more environmentally friendly and more viable long-term energy sources relative to nuclear power and natural gas  however  solar and wind were viewed as being less reliable relative to nuclear power and natural gas  in 2012 a poll done in the uk found that 63  of those surveyed support nuclear power  and with opposition to nuclear power at 11   in germany  strong
sentiment led to eight of the seventeen operating reactors being permanently shut down following the march 2011  
research  in the form of the
is underway  fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable  as fission power had been  however  the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and
led to projections being extended by several decades  in 2010  more than 60 years after the first attempts  commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050  although rather than an either  or  issue economical
could be built before any attempt at this more demanding commercial     reactor takes place

natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases  i e  co2 and methanech4  than coal when burned at power plants  but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain 
a study performed by the environmental protection agency  epa  and the gas research institute  gri  in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas  predominantly methane  use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions  the study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions  more recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study  with researchers from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  reconfirming findings of high rates of methane  ch4  leakage from natural gas fields 
a 2011 study by noted climate research scientist  tom wigley  found that while carbon dioxide  co2  emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy  it also found that additional methane  ch4  from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system  offsetting the reduction in co2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas  the study looked at methane leakage from coal mining  changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols  and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation  on balance  these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced co2 emissions  when gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0   and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10   the overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century  however  are small  petron et al   2013  and alvarez et al   2012  note that estimated that leakage from gas infrastructure is likely to be underestimated  these studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a  cleaner  fuel is questionable  a 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale  the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage 
heat pump  
main article 
outside unit of an air-source heat pump 
a heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a  heat sink   heat pumps are designed to move
opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one  a heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink 
while
and
are familiar examples of heat pumps  the term  heat pump  is more general and applies to many
 heating  ventilating  and air conditioning  devices used for space heating or space cooling  when a heat pump is used for heating  it employs the same basic
used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator  but in the opposite directionreleasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment  in this use  heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground  in heating mode  heat pumps are three to four times
in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters 
it has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market  with a market share of 30  and  potentially  clean electricity  heat pumps could reduce global co2 emissions by 8  annually  using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60  of the
demand and 90  of co2 emissions in europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier  using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion 
with significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production  demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases  without a high share of low-carbon electricity  a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas

energy efficiency and conservation  
main articles 
and
a spiral-type integrated   use has grown among north american consumers since its introduction in the mid-1990s 
efficient energy use  sometimes simply called  energy efficiency   is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services  for example 
allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature  installing
or natural
reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional  
use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights 
energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing   for example  the state of
began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s  including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements  during the following years  california s energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national u s  consumption doubled  as part of its strategy  california implemented a  loading order  for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first  renewable electricity supplies second  and new fossil-fired power plants last 
is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy service  for example through behavioural change  as well as encompassing energy efficiency  examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter  driving less  or working in a less brightly lit room  as with other definitions  the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy  but both are important in environmental and economic terms  this is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels 
reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions  according to the   improved energy efficiency in   industrial processes and
could reduce the world s energy needs in 2050 by one third  and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases 
demand side switching sources  
fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service  to meet deep decarbonization goals  like the 80  reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in california and the european union  many primary energy changes are needed  energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals  switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions  progressively coal  oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced  for an equivalent amount of heat  burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning   there are various ways in which this could happen  and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations  while the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat  the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric
has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates  this is possible because of the very efficient
of heat pumps 
at the beginning of this century 70  of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels  and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix  replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit  in areas like norway 
and
that have abundant hydroelectricity  electric heat and hot water is common 
the economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating  will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment  the eia annual energy outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades  electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in   since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage  electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid 
alternatives to electrification  include decarbonizing pipeline gas through     or other   a 2015 study by energy environmental economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas  electrification  and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in southern california 
demand side grid management  
expanding intermittent electrical sources such as   creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations  some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental
costing billions of dollars  however instead of building for more power there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side  designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy  power failures and peak demands  having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a  
metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption  for instance  running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed  reduces electricity costs 
plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid  this method may work very well with thermostats  when power on the grid sags a small amount  a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid  for instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations  consumers would need to have a
in order for the utility to calculate credits 
devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid  the message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand  to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid  or notifications about the current and expected prices for power  this would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day  the
suggestion would use a car s battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily 
lifestyle and behavior  
the
emphasises that behaviour  lifestyle and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors  particularly when complementing technological and structural change  20 in general  higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact  overall  food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based ghg emissions with nearly 20  of the global carbon footprint  followed by housing  mobility  services  manufactured products  and construction  food and services are more significant in poor countries  while mobility and manufactured goods are more significant in rich countries  327

avoided desertification  
managed grazing methods are argued to be able to restore grasslands  thereby significantly decreasing atmospheric co2 levels 
restoring grasslands store co2 from the air into plant material  grazing livestock  usually not left to wander  would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth  however  grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds  preventing them from photosynthesizing and the dying plant would stay in place  a method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day a two in order to mimick natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally  additionally  when part of leaf matter is consumed by a herding animal  a corresponding amount of root matter is sloughed off too as it would not be able to sustain the previous amount of root matter and while most of the lost root matter would rot and enter the atmosphere  part of the carbon is sequestered into the soil  it is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the worlds 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland by 1  would offset nearly 12 years of co2 emissions    as part of   claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification  prehistoric lands supported large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the united states are still desertifying

main article 
carbon capture and storage  ccs  is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing
 co2  from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere  the intergovernmental panel on climate change says ccs could contribute between 10  and 55  of the cumulative worldwide carbon-mitigation effort over the next 90 years  the international energy agency says ccs is  the most important single new technology for co2 savings  in power generation and industry  though it requires up to 40  more energy to run a ccs coal power plant than a regular coal plant  ccs could potentially capture about 90  of all the carbon emitted by the plant  norway  which first began storing co2  has cut its emissions by almost a million tons a year  or about 3  of the country s 1990 levels  as of late 2011  the total co2 storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year  this is broadly equivalent to preventing the emissions from more than six million cars from entering the atmosphere each year

non-co2 greenhouse gases  
co2 is not the only ghg relevant to mitigation  and governments have acted to regulate the emissions of other ghgs emitted by human activities   ghgs   the emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the

stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic ghgs requires an understanding of their different physical properties  stabilization depends both on how quickly ghgs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed  the rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the ghg in question  see the
for a list   here  the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the ghg in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37  of its initial amount  methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years  while n2o s lifetime is about 110 years  for methane  a reduction of about 30  below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration  while for n2o  an emissions reduction of more than 50  would be required 
is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than
in the amount of heat it can trap  especially in the short term  burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide  indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source  reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact  as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane  in terms of prevention  vaccines are being developed in australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from
released by livestock via

costs and benefits  
main article 
costs  
the
proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm co2e by 2050  the review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels  the review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range 1.0 to  3.5  of world    i e     with an average estimate of approximately 1   stern has since revised his estimate to 2  of gwp  for comparison  the gross world product  gwp  at
was estimated at  74.5 trillion in 2010  thus 2  is approximately  1.5 trillion  the review emphasises that these costs are contingent on steady reductions in the cost of low-carbon technologies  mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut  early  well-planned action will minimise the costs 
one way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes  policy makers can compare the
of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time  the marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country  by sector  and over time 
benefits  
total extreme weather cost and number of events costing more than  1 billion in the united states from 1980 to 2011 
yohe et al   2007  assessed the literature on sustainability and climate change  with high confidence  they suggested that up to the year 2050  an effort to cap greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions at 550ppm would benefit developing countries significantly  this was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation  by 2100  however  it was still judged likely that there would be significant   this was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced  
sharing  
one of the aspects of mitigation is how to share the costs and benefits of mitigation policies  there is no scientific consensus over how to share these costs and benefits  toth et al   2001   in terms of the politics of mitigation  the unfccc s ultimate objective is to stabilize concentrations of ghg in the atmosphere at a level that would

ghg emissions are an important correlate of wealth  at least at present  banuri et al   1996  pp 9192   wealth  as measured by per capita income  i e   income per head of population   varies widely between different countries  activities of the poor that involve emissions of ghgs are often associated with basic needs  such as
to stay tolerably warm  in richer countries  emissions tend to be associated with things like     etc  the impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human
according to wealth 
distributing emissions abatement costs  
there have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions  banuri et al   1996  pp 103105  
  this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource  i e   polluting the atmosphere 
basic needs  this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs  as defined according to a minimum level of   consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights  from this viewpoint  developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime 
proportionality and polluter-pays principle  proportionality reflects the ancient
principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in  and pay in proportion to the damages they cause  this has a potential relationship with the  polluter-pays principle   which can be interpreted in a number of ways 
historical responsibilities  this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions  two-thirds of the stock of ghgs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries  goldemberg et al   1996  p 29  
comparable burdens and ability to pay  with this approach  countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction  ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population  as well as other  more complex measures  like the  s  
  with this approach  countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions 
specific proposals  
ad hoc  lashof  1992  and cline  1992   referred to by banuri et al   1996  p 106   for example  suggested that allocations based partly on
could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions  this is because gnp and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions 
equal per capita entitlements  this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs  and is derived from egalitarianism  banuri et al   1996  pp 106107   this approach can be divided into two categories  in the first category  emissions are allocated according to national population  in the second category  emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical  cumulative  emissions 
status quo  with this approach  historical emissions are ignored  and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit  banuri et al   1996  p 107   an analogy for this approach can be made with   which is a common  limited resource  the analogy would be with the atmosphere  which can be viewed as an exhaustible

  28 november 2015
many countries  both developing and developed  are aiming to use cleaner technologies  world bank  2010  p 192   use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in co2 emissions  policies include targets for emissions reductions  increased use of renewable energy  and increased energy efficiency  it is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations  where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist  the
is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons  countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling  if their gas taxes are high  if they do not subsidize the fishing industry  if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita  and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber 
kyoto protocol  
main article 
the main current international agreement on combating climate change is the   which came into force on 16 february 2005  the kyoto protocol is an
to the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  
have committed to reduce their emissions of
and five other greenhouse gases  or engage in
if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases 
temperature targets  
the graph on the right shows three  pathways  to meet the unfccc s 2c target  labelled  global technology    decentralised solutions   and  consumption change   each pathway shows how various measures  e g   improved energy efficiency  increased use of renewable energy  could contribute to emissions reductions  image credit  pbl  
actions to mitigate climate change are sometimes based on the goal of achieving a particular temperature target  one of the targets that has been suggested is to limit the future increase in global mean temperature  global warming  to below 2c  relative to the pre-industrial level  the 2c target was adopted in 2010 by parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change  most countries of the world are parties to the unfccc  the target had been adopted in 1996 by the  
feasibility of 2c
temperatures have increased by 0.8c compared to the pre-industrial level  and another 0.50.7c is already   the 2c rise is typically associated in
with a
concentration of 400500
by volume  the current  january 2015  level of carbon dioxide alone is 400 ppm by volume  and rising at 13 ppm annually  hence  to avoid a very likely breach of the 2c target  co2 levels would have to be stabilised very soon  this is generally regarded as unlikely  based on current programs in place to date  the importance of change is illustrated by the fact that world economic energy efficiency is improving at only half the rate of world  
views in the literature
there is disagreement among experts over whether or not the 2c target can be met  for example  according to anderson and bows  2011    there is little to no chance  of meeting the target  on the other hand  according to alcamo et al   2013  
policies adopted by parties to the unfccc are too weak to meet a 2 or 1.5c target  however  these targets might still be achievable if more stringent mitigation policies are adopted immediately 
cost-effective 2c scenarios project annual global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before the year 2020  with deep cuts in emissions thereafter  leading to a reduction in 2050 of 41  compared to 1990 levels 
discussion on other targets
scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies  such as reducing ghg emissions  however  deciding what policies are best requires value judgements  for example  limiting global warming to 1c relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2c limit  however  a 1c limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2c limit 
according to some analysts  the 2c  guardrail  is inadequate for the needed degree and timeliness of mitigation  on the other hand  some economic studies suggest more modest mitigation policies  for example  the emissions reductions proposed by nordhaus  2010  might lead to global warming  in the year 2100  of around 3c  relative to pre-industrial levels 
official long-term target of 1.5c
in 2015  two official unfccc scientific expert bodies came to the conclusion that   in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems  high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5c   this expert position was  together with the strong diplomatic voice of the poorest countries and the island nations in the pacific  the driving force leading to the decision of the
2015  to lay down this 1.5c long-term target on top of the existing 2c goal 
encouraging use changes  
emissions tax  
see also      and
an emissions tax on greenhouse gas emissions requires individual emitters to pay a fee  charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere  most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in oecd countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles  rather than on co2 emissions directly 
emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective  difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity  and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction  emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes  in developing countries  institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources 
subsidies  
according to   a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100  renewable power by 2030  jacobson  and his colleague mark delucchi  suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour  in 2007 dollars  for wind  about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric  from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal  and 8 cents per kwh for solar  fossil  and nuclear power

implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions  a lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation  funding is often provided by nations  groups of nations and increasingly ngo and private sources  these funds are often channelled through the global environmental facility  gef   this is an environmental funding mechanism in the world bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues  the gef was originally designed to tackle four main areas  biological diversity  climate change  international waters and ozone layer depletion  to which land degradation and persistent organic pollutant were added  the gef funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the gefs implementing agencies 
problems  
there are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation  it has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are  uncertainty  fragmentation  institutional void  short time horizon of policies and politicians and missing motives and willingness to start adapting  the relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation  when information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed  context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier  institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place  calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes  the short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues  statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made  missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation 
the issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation  such as   could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as apposed to one overall enforcement agency 
occurrence  
despite a perceived lack of occurrence  evidence of implementation is emerging internationally  some examples of this are the initiation of napas and of joint implementation  many developing nations have made national adaptation programs of action  napas  which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs  the implementation of many of these is supported by gef agencies  many developed countries are implementing first generation institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale  there has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the unfcc as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved

efforts to reduce
include
which encourage efficiency through programs like     and the   on 12 november 1998  vice president
symbolically signed the kyoto protocol  but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the  
in 2007  transportation secretary   with white house approval  urged governors and dozens of members of the house of representatives to block californias first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks  according to e-mails obtained by congress  the
is a group of about twenty federal agencies and us cabinet departments  all working together to address global warming 
the
pressured american scientists to suppress discussion of global warming  according to the testimony of the union of concerned scientists to the oversight and government reform committee of the u s  house of representatives   high-quality science  was  struggling to get out   as the bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the bush administration s skepticism  in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist   nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words  climate change    global warming  or other similar terms from a variety of communications   similarly  according to the testimony of senior officers of the   the white house attempted to bury the report  national assessment of the potential consequences of climate variability and change   produced by u s  scientists pursuant to u s  law  some u s  scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to white house pressure to underreport global warming 
in the absence of substantial federal action  state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the
in the northeast and the
in california 
developing countries  
in order to reconcile
with mitigating carbon emissions 
need particular support  both financial and technical  one of the means of achieving this is the kyoto protocol s
 cdm   the  s prototype carbon fund is a
that operates within the cdm 
an important point of contention  however  is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation  one of the outcomes of the unfcc
was the   in which developed countries promised to provide us  30million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources  yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the
has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional  and researchers at the
have found four main understandings 
climate finance classified as aid  but additional to  over and above  the  
increase on previous year s
 oda  spent on climate change mitigation 
rising oda levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage  and
increase in climate finance not connected to oda 
the main point being that there is a conflict between the
states budget deficit cuts  the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important  
however  none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries  this is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions  critics   of mitigation often argue that  the developing countries  drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming  critics   also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet 
in an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies 
and
urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the
 which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services  
non-governmental approaches  
while many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding  legislation and regulatory action  individuals and
can also play a part in the mitigation effort 
choices in personal actions and business operations  
environmental groups encourage   often aimed at the   common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage  burning less gasoline  supporting renewable   buying local products to reduce transportation  turning off unused devices  and various others 
a
at
has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation  suggesting the use of communications technologies such as
to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights 
air travel and shipment  
in 2008  climate scientist
raised concern about the growing effect of rapidly increasing global air transport on the climate in a paper  and a presentation  suggesting that reversing this trend is necessary to reduce emissions 
part of the difficulty is that when
are made at high altitude  the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise  others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing
of individuals  whether traveling for business or pleasure  involving frequent and often long distance air travel  as well as air shipment of goods 
business opportunities and risks  
main article 
on 9 may 2005   the
of
 ge   announced plans to reduce ge s global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012   ge said that given its projected growth  those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action  
on 21 june 2005 a group of leading  
and
pledged to work together to reduce the negative   including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving
and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels  the group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005  and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the  s carbon emission trading scheme 
investor response  
main article 
climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings  sri    funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high esg  environmental  social  governance  standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals 
can be used to draft guidelines for
that take these concerns into account 
legal action  
see also 
in some countries  those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers  attempts at litigation have been initiated by entire peoples such as palau and the inuit  as well as non-governmental organizations such as the sierra club  although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible  methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming 
for a legal action for
 or similar  to succeed   plaintiffs     must show that  more probably than not  their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question  as opposed to any other cause  this has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two   another route  though with little legal bite  is the   if it can be shown that climate change is affecting
like  
besides countries suing one another  there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government  legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the
to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the   and against the
and
for failing to assess environmental impacts  including global warming impacts  under    
in the netherlands and belgium  organisations as
and the
in belgium have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren t meeting the emission reductions they agreed to  urgenda has all ready won their case against the dutch government 
according to a 2004 study commissioned by  
and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world s man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002  the group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action 
in 2015    received a subpoena  according to the washington post and confirmed by the company  the attorney general of new york    opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had mislead the public and investors about the risks of climate change
