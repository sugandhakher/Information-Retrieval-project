a clothes line or washing line is any type of   cord  or
that has been stretched between two points  e g  two sticks   outside or indoors  above the level of the ground 
that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry  using clothes pegs or   washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall  and are frequently located in   or on   longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing 
more elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape  with multiple lines being used  such as the

in   many
buildings have a  drying green   which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines  it may also be used as a recreational space - as well as a
connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather

laundry items stay softer to the touch  mechanical clothes dryers tend to remove short  soft  fine fibers   and may be less wrinkled
laundry items often do not need ironing if line dried in a breeze
avoids the potential of airborne lint and reduced air quality
eliminates the noise from a mechanical clothes dryer

for a simple line drying arrangement  rope and clothes pins  the repair and replacement costs are about  20.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 2 cents per load  for non-commercial mechanical clothes drying the repair and replacement costs  including labor expenses  are about  200.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 20 cents per load 
disadvantages  
putting laundry on a line usually takes more time than putting it into a mechanical dryer  as laundry items have to be hung up and fixed one by one  
laundry items need to be hung indoors during rainy weather  or may get wet if the weather changes 
neighbours may find it aesthetically unpleasant
exposing dirty laundry can lessen privacy  showing information about inhabitants  living habits 
risk of theft or vandalism of clothes
environmental contaminants such as soil  dust  smoke  automotive or industrial pollutants  pollen and bird and animal droppings can come in contact with clothing 
clothespins can leave imprints  including rust from the spring  on the clothes 
drying laundry indoors  
clothes drying indoors
laundry may be dried indoors rather than outdoors for a variety of reasons including 
inclement weather
physical disability
lack of space for a line
reduce the damage to fabrics from sun s uv rays
legal restrictions
to raise the humidity level indoors  and lower the air temperature indoors
convenience
to preserve privacy
several types of devices are available for indoor drying  a
or
can help save space in an   or clothes lines can be strung in the
during the winter  small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower curtain pole  the drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying because of the lack of direct
and the
assistance of the wind 
the
of the moisture from the clothes will cool the indoor air and increase the humidity level  which may or may not be desirable  in cold  dry weather  moderate increases in humidity make most people feel more comfortable  in warm weather  increased humidity makes most people feel even hotter  increased humidity can also increase growth of fungi  which can cause health problems 
an average-sized wash load will convert approximately 4965 kilojoules of ambient heat into latent heat that is stored in the evaporated water  as follows  a typical 4kg load of laundry can contain 2.2kg of water  after being spun in a laundry machine  to determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry  weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried  the difference is the weight of the water that was evaporated from them  multiply that weight in
by 2,257 kj kg    to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water  or multiply by 0.6250 kwh kg to get    note  if the moisture later
inside the house  the latent heat will be converted back into ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly  
to obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation  the process can be traced on a  
factors that determine the drying duration  
various factors determine the duration of drying and can help to decide rather to use a drier or a clothes line
the environmental
- increase of temperature decreases the drying duration
the environmental
- decrease of humidity will decrease the drying duration
velocity - sometimes people put a
near the clothes when drying them indoors
direct sun - usually only the external line will be exposed to direct sun  so usually people put the thickest clothes on the most external line

drying laundry in freezing conditions  
laundry may be dried outdoors when the temperature is well below the freezing point  first  the moisture in the laundry items will freeze and the clothing will become stiff  then the frost on the clothes will sublimate into the air  leaving the items dry  it takes a long time and it is usually much quicker to dry them indoors  however  indoor drying removes heat from the air so it is a trade-off between speed and energy efficiency 
controversy in north america  
controversy surrounding the use of clothes lines has prompted many governments to pass  right-to-dry  laws allowing their use  according to ian urbina  a reporter for    the majority of the 60 million people who now live in the countrys roughly 300,000 private communities  are forbidden from using outdoor clothes lines 
as of august 2013  the states of florida  colorado  hawaii  arizona  california  illinois  indiana  louisiana  maine  maryland  massachusetts  nevada  new mexico  north carolina  oregon  texas  vermont  virginia  and wisconsin had passed laws forbidding bans on clothes lines  with utah allowing local jurisdictions to forbid such bans  at least eight states restrict homeowners  associations from forbidding the installation of solar-energy systems  and lawyers have debated whether or not those laws might apply to clothes lines  a british filmmaker  steven lake  was planning to release a documentary in 2011 titled drying for freedom about the clothes-line controversy in the united states 
in canada  the province of nova scotia s first ndp government passed an act to prevent prohibitions on the use of clotheslines on december 10  2010 to allow all homeowners in the province to use clotheslines  regardless of restrictive covenants  the province of ontario lifted bans on clothes lines in 2008 
some other affluent suburban municipalities such as
or
also prohibit clotheslines
