passive solar building design
in passive solar building design  windows  walls  and floors are made to collect  store  and distribute
in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer  this is called passive solar design because  unlike active
systems  it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices 
the key to design a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local
performing an accurate   elements to be considered include window placement and size  and
type      and shading  passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings  but existing buildings can be adapted or  retrofitted

on the -side of a building 
is the use of the same design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements 
some passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers  shutters  night insulation  and other devices that enhance solar energy collection  storage  and use  and reduce undesirable

more widely  passive solar technologies include the
and   but these typically require some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers  and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use   low-grade  energy needs  such as space and water heating  have proven  over time  to be better applications for passive use of solar energy 
as a science  
the
basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of  
 particularly       and       passive movement of air and water without the use of electricity  fans or pumps   and human
based on  
and
control for buildings to be inhabited by humans or animals    solariums  and
for raising plants 
specific attention is divided into  the site  location and solar orientation of the building  local   the prevailing level of
  sunshine clouds    design and construction quality materials  placement size type of windows and walls  and incorporation of solar-energy-storing
with  
while these considerations may be directed toward any building  achieving an ideal optimized cost performance solution requires careful   
of these scientific principles 
through computer modeling  such as the comprehensive u s  department of energy  energy plus 
software   and application of decades of lessons learned  since the 1970s energy crisis  can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage  without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics  in fact  passive-solar design features such as a greenhouse sunroom solarium can greatly enhance the livability  daylight  views  and value of a home  at a low cost per unit of space 
much has been learned about passive solar building design since the 1970s energy crisis  many unscientific  intuition-based expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve
- the total elimination of heating-and-cooling energy bills 
passive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive  using off-the-shelf existing materials and technology   but the scientific passive solar building design is a non-trivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counter-intuitive lessons learned  and time to enter  evaluate  and iteratively refine the
input and output 
one of the most useful post-construction evaluation tools has been the use of
using digital
for a formal quantitative scientific   thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day 
the scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive
computer software systems  like u s  doe energy plus  
scientific passive solar building design with quantitative
is not easy for a novice  the level of complexity has resulted in ongoing bad-architecture  and many intuition-based  unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideas   
the economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant  if it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in 1980  based on 1970s lessons learned   america could be saving over  250,000,000 per year on expensive energy and related pollution today   
since 1979  passive solar building design has been a critical element of achieving
by educational institution experiments  and governments around the world  including the u s  department of energy  and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades  the
was established decades ago  but
into architecture  construction trades  and building-owner
has been very slow and difficult to change   
the new terms  architectural science  and  architectural technology  are being added to some schools of architecture  with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energy-engineering principles   
the solar path in passive design

and
the ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the sun s path throughout the day 
this occurs as a result of the
of the earth s axis of rotation in relation to its   the

in northern hemisphere non-tropical latitudes farther than 23.5 degrees from the equator 
the sun will reach its
toward the south  in the direction of the equator 
as winter
approaches  the
at which the sun
and
progressively moves further toward the south and the daylight hours will become shorter
the opposite is noted in summer where the sun will rise and set further toward the north and the daylight hours will lengthen
the converse is observed in the southern hemisphere  but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in 
in equatorial regions at less than 23.5 degrees  the position of the sun at
will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year 
in regions closer than 23.5 degrees from either north-or-south pole  during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later  during the height of winter 
the 47-degree difference in the altitude of the sun at
between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design  this information is combined with local climatic data    heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for   and when it should be blocked with shading  by strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices  the percent of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year 
one
sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before  and six weeks after  the solstice  due to  thermal lag  from the
of the earth  the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice  movable shutters  shades  shade screens  or window quilts can accommodate day-to-day and hour-to-hour solar gain and insulation requirements 
careful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design  a common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side  a

through roof  walls  floor and windows 
convective heat transfer  
can be beneficial or detrimental  uncontrolled air infiltration from poor
  weatherstripping   draft-proofing can contribute up to 40  of heat loss during winter  however  strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection  cross-ventilation  and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and   filtered
systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity  dust  pollen  and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air 
natural convection causing
warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat  this may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space  serve as a method of venting hot air  or be designed in as a natural-convection air-flow loop for
heat distribution and temperature equalization  natural human cooling by

radiative heat transfer

also degrade its insulation properties  when shading windows  external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal  
western and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting  but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded  in contrast  the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter  but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall  the amount of radiant heat received is related to the location       and seasonal   hourly

key passive solar building design concepts  
there are six primary passive solar energy configurations 
direct
indirect solar gain
isolated solar gain
heat storage
insulation and glazing
direct solar gain  
direct gain attempts to control the amount of direct
reaching the living space  this direct solar gain is a critical part of passive solar house designation as it imparts to a direct gain 
the cost effectiveness of these configurations are currently being investigated in great detail and are demonstrating promising results 
indirect solar gain  
indirect gain attempts to control solar radiation reaching an area adjacent but not part of the living space  heat enters the building through windows and is captured and stored in
 e g  water tank  masonry wall  and slowly transmitted indirectly to the building through
and   efficiency can suffer from slow response  thermal lag  and heat losses at night  other issues include the cost of
and developing effective systems to redistribute heat throughout the living area 
isolated solar gain  
isolated gain involves utilizing solar energy to passively move heat from or to the living space using a fluid  such as water or air by natural convection or forced   heat gain can occur through a sunspace 
or solar closet  these areas may also be employed usefully as a greenhouse or drying cabinet  an equator-side sun room may have its exterior windows higher than the windows between the sun room and the interior living space  to allow the low winter sun to penetrate to the cold side of adjacent rooms  glass placement and overhangs prevent solar gain during the summer 
or other
techniques can keep a solarium cool in the summer 
measures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night e g  window coverings or movable window insulation 
examples 
thermal buffer zone
system
heat storage  
the sun doesn t shine all the time  heat storage  or   keeps the building warm when the sun can t heat it 
in diurnal solar houses  the storage is designed for one or a few days  the usual method is a custom-constructed thermal mass  this includes a   a ventilated concrete floor  a cistern  water wall or roof pond  it is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself  either as-is or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium 
in subarctic areas  or areas that have long terms without solar gain  e g  weeks of freezing fog   purpose-built thermal mass is very expensive  don stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage  his designs run an isolated thermosiphon 3m under a house  and insulate the ground with a 6m waterproof skirt 
insulation  
main article 
or
 type  placement and amount  reduces unwanted leakage of heat  some passive buildings are actually  
special glazing systems and window coverings  
main articles 
and
the effectiveness of direct
systems is significantly enhanced by insulative  e g     spectrally selective glazing     or movable window insulation  window quilts  bifold interior insulation shutters  shades  etc   
generally  equator-facing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain 
there is extensive use of super-insulated windows in the
standard  selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling
for the design location 
glazing selection  
equator-facing glass  
the requirement for vertical equator-facing glass is different from the other three sides of a building 
and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain  however  direct-gain systems are more dependent on
to reduce heat loss  indirect-gain and isolated-gain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only single-pane glazing  nevertheless  the optimal cost-effective solution is both location and system dependent 
roof-angle glass   skylights  
skylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare either horizontally  a flat roof  or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope  in some cases  horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation  and harsh glare   depending on the roof   when the winter sun is low on the horizon  most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass   the
is nearly parallel to roof-angled glass morning and afternoon    when the summer sun is high  it is nearly perpendicular to roof-angled glass  which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year  and acts like a solar furnace  skylights should be covered and well-insulated to reduce
  warm air rising   heat loss on cold winter nights  and intense solar heat gain during hot spring summer fall days 
the equator-facing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere  and north in the southern hemisphere  skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination  except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator side of the building  at some    skylights on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning  west-facing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day 
some skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain  while still allowing some visible light transmission  however  if visible light can pass through it  so can some radiant heat gain  they are both
waves  
you can partially reduce some of the unwanted roof-angled-glazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of
 leaf-shedding  trees  or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight  this would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer  if tree limbs hang over a roof  they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters  possibly cause roof-damaging   shorten roof life  and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic  leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing  difficult to clean  and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms 
 sawtooth roof glazing  with vertical-glass-only can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building  without the need for any roof-angled glass or skylights 
skylights provide daylight  the only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications  well-insulated
can bring daylight into northern rooms  without using a skylight  a passive-solar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equator-side of the building 
infrared
color thermal imaging cameras   used in formal
  can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day 
the u s  department of energy states   vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces   roof-angled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces 
the u s  doe explains drawbacks to roof-angled glazing  glass and plastic have little structural strength  when installed vertically  glass  or plastic  bears its own weight because only a small area  the top edge of the glazing  is subject to gravity  as the glass tilts off the vertical axis  however  an increased area  now the sloped cross-section  of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity  glass is also brittle  it does not flex much before breaking  to counteract this  you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing  both increase overall cost  and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace 
another common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather  it is difficult to maintain a good seal on roof-angled glass in intense sunlight  hail  sleet  snow  and wind may cause material failure  for occupant safety  regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass  laminated  or a combination thereof  which reduce solar gain potential  most of the roof-angled glass on the crowne plaza hotel orlando airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm  roof-angled glass increases construction cost  and can increase insurance premiums  vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roof-angled glass 
it is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day  skylights are the antithesis of
passive solar cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement 
angle of incident radiation  
the amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident  
striking glass within 20 degrees of
is mostly transmitted through the glass  whereas sunlight at more than 35 degrees from perpendicular is mostly

computer software can determine the impact of   and cooling-and-heating

operable shading and insulation devices  
a design with too much equator-facing glass can result in excessive winter  spring  or fall day heating  uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year  and excessive heat transfer on winter nights and summer days 
although the sun is at the same altitude 6-weeks before and after the solstice  the heating and cooling requirements before and after the solstice are significantly different  heat storage on the earth s surface causes  thermal lag   variable cloud cover influences solar gain potential  this means that latitude-specific fixed window overhangs  while important  are not a complete seasonal solar gain control solution 
control mechanisms  such as manual-or-motorized interior insulated drapes  shutters  exterior roll-down shade screens  or retractable awnings  can compensate for differences caused by thermal lag or cloud cover  and help control daily   hourly solar gain requirement variations 
systems that monitor temperature  sunlight  time of day  and room occupancy can precisely control motorized window-shading-and-insulation devices

other passive solar principles  
passive solar lighting  
main article 
techniques enhance taking advantage of
for interiors  and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems 
this can be achieved by careful building design  orientation  and placement of window sections to collect light  other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building  window sections should be adequately sized  and to avoid
can be shielded with a     well placed trees  glass coatings  and other passive and active devices 
another major issue for many
systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss  whilst high mounted
window and traditional
can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building  unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control  thus  energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating
systems to maintain  
various methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to  
and novel materials such as
semi-transparent insulation 
embedded in walls or roof  or  
reflecting elements  from active and
collectors  such as   lighter wall and floor colors 
wall sections  interior walls with upper glass panels  and clear or translucent glassed hinged
and
take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside  the light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar
or from
sources  in traditional
the
sliding panel doors  with translucent
screens  are an original precedent   
and
were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial  commercial  and residential applications 
passive solar water heating  
main article 
there are many ways to use
to heat water for domestic use  different active-and-passive
technologies have different location-specific economic
implications 
fundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical  it is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy sub-freezing  or very-cloudy  weather conditions  other active solar water heating technologies  etc  may be more appropriate for some locations 
it is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being  off grid  and qualifies as sustainable  this is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumps   
comparison to the passive house standard in europe  
main article 
there is growing momentum in europe for the approach espoused by the
 passivhaus in german  institute in germany  rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques  this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat  minimises energy usage  and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration  most of the buildings built to the passive house standard also incorporate an active
unit with or without a small  typically 1kw  incorporated heating component 
the energy design of passive house buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the passive house planning package  phpp  which is updated periodically  the current version is phpp2007  where 2007 is the year of issue  a building may be certified as a  passive house  when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria  the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed 15kwh m2a 
design tools  
traditionally a
was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year  in modern times  computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data  including site impacts such as
and physical obstructions  to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year  -based
applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device  these
provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions  design elements and orientation prior to construction  energy performance optimization normally requires an iterative-refinement design-and-evaluate process  there is no such thing as a  one-size-fits-all  universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations 
levels of application  
many detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance  comfort or usability  this is done using good siting and window positioning  small amounts of thermal mass  with good-but-conventional insulation  weatherization  and an occasional supplementary heat source  such as a central radiator connected to a  solar  water heater  sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its   this will then
heat into the building in the evening  external shading  or a radiant barrier plus air gap  may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain 
an extension of the  passive solar  approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling  these designs attempt to capture warm-season solar heat  and convey it to a
for use months later during the cold season   annualised passive solar    increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or   anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority  the approach also can move cooling into the warm season  examples

a  purely passive  solar-heated house would have no mechanical furnace unit  relying instead on energy captured from sunshine  only supplemented by  incidental  heat energy given off by lights  computers  and other task-specific appliances  such as those for cooking  entertainment  etc    showering  people and pets  the use of natural convection air currents  rather than mechanical devices such as fans  to circulate air is related  though not strictly solar design  passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers  insulating shutters  shades  awnings  or reflectors  some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow  a reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their   a heat pump might use 1 j for every 4 j it delivers giving a cop of 4  a system that only uses a 30 w fan to more-evenly distribute 10kw of solar heat through an entire house would have a cop of 300 
passive solar building design is often a foundational element of a cost-effective   although a zeb uses multiple passive solar building design concepts  a zeb is usually not purely passive  having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as          and other emerging alternative energy sources 
passive solar design on skyscrapers  
there has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency  because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments  yet require large amounts of energy to operate  there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques  one study  which analyzed the proposed
tower in london  found that a 35  energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains  by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration  usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building  and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain  indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness  from 20 to 30cm   using
on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss  dedicating 15-20  of floor area for thermal storage  and implementing a
to absorb heat entering the space  overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer  and allow it in the winter  and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months 
another study analyzed double-green skin facade  dgsf  on the outside of high rise buildings in hong kong  such a green facade  or vegetation covering the outer walls  can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly - as much as 80   as discovered by the researchers 
in more temperate climates  strategies such as glazing  adjustment of window-to-wall ratio  sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings  in the 30  to 60  range
