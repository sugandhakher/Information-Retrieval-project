history
main article 
the history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of   the first abstraction  which is shared by many animals  was probably that of   the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges  for example  have something in common  namely quantity of their members 
greek mathematician
 c  570  c  495 bc   commonly credited with discovering the
as evidenced by
found on bone  in addition to recognizing how to
physical objects 
peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities  like time days    years 
evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000bc  when the
and egyptians began using arithmetic  algebra and geometry for
and other financial calculations  for building and construction  and for   the earliest uses of mathematics were in    
and
patterns and the recording of time 
in
    
and   first appears in the archaeological record 
pre-dated
and
have been many and diverse  with the first known written numerals created by

texts such as the

began a systematic study of mathematics in its own right with  
persian mathematician

during the   especially during the 9th and 10th centuries  mathematics saw many important innovations building on greek mathematics  most of them include the contributions from persian mathematicians such as

mathematics has since been greatly extended  and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and   to the benefit of both  mathematical discoveries continue to be made today  according to mikhail b  sevryuk  in the january 2006 issue of the    the number of papers and books included in the
database since 1940  the first year of operation of mr  is now more than 1.9million  and more than 75thousand items are added to the database each year  the overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical
and their   
etymology
the word mathematics comes from the
  mthma   which  in the ancient greek language  means  that which is learnt    what one gets to know   hence also  study  and  science   and in modern greek just  lesson   the word mthma is derived from   manthano   while the modern greek equivalent is   mathaino   both of which mean  to learn   in greece  the word for  mathematics  came to have the narrower and more technical meaning  mathematical study  even in classical times  its adjective is   mathmatiks   meaning  related to learning  or  studious   which likewise further came to mean  mathematical   in particular     mathmatik tkhn     ars mathematica  meant  the mathematical art  
similarly  one of the two main schools of thought in
was known as the mathmatikoi    - which at the time meant  teachers  rather than  mathematicians  in the modern sense 
in latin  and in english until around 1700  the term mathematics more commonly meant  astrology   or sometimes  astronomy   rather than  mathematics   the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800  this has resulted in several mistranslations  a particularly notorious one is  s warning that christians should beware of mathematici meaning astrologers  which is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians 
the apparent plural form in english  like the french plural form les mathmatiques  and the less commonly used singular derivative la mathmatique   goes back to the latin neuter plural mathematica     based on the greek plural    ta mathmatik   used by
 384322bc   and meaning roughly  all things mathematical   although it is plausible that english borrowed only the adjective mathematic al  and formed the noun mathematics anew  after the pattern of
and   which were inherited from the greek  in english  the noun mathematics takes singular verb forms  it is often shortened to maths or  in english-speaking north america  math 
definitions of mathematics
main article 
  the
mathematician who established the hinduarabic numeral system to the western world
defined mathematics as  the science of quantity   and this definition prevailed until the 18th century  starting in the 19thcentury  when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as
and   which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement  mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions  some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics  some emphasize its abstractness  some emphasize certain topics within mathematics  today  no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails  even among professionals  there is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science  a great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics  or consider it undefinable  some just say   mathematics is what mathematicians do  
three leading types of definition of mathematics are called     and   each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought  all have severe problems  none has widespread acceptance  and no reconciliation seems possible 
an early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was  s  the science that draws necessary conclusions   1870   in the  
and
advanced the philosophical program known as   and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts  statements  and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of   a logicist definition of mathematics is russell s  all mathematics is symbolic logic   1903  
definitions  developing from the philosophy of mathematician   identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena  an example of an intuitionist definition is  mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other   a peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions  in particular  while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed  intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct 
definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them 
defined mathematics simply as  the science of formal systems   a
is a set of symbols  or tokens  and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas  in formal systems  the word axiom has a special meaning  different from the ordinary meaning of  a self-evident truth   in formal systems  an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system 
mathematics as science
  known as the prince of mathematicians
referred to mathematics as  the queen of the sciences   in the original latin regina scientiarum  as well as in
knigin der wissenschaften  the word corresponding to science means a  field of knowledge   and this was the original meaning of  science  in english  also  mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge  the specialization restricting the meaning of  science  to
follows the rise of   which contrasted  natural science  to   the
of inquiring from   the role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics  compared to natural sciences such as     or  
stated that  as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality  they are not certain  and as far as they are certain  they do not refer to reality   more recently 
has called mathematics  the queen of science    the main driving force behind scientific discovery  
many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally   and thus not a science according to the definition of   however  in the 1930s
convinced many mathematicians   that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone  and karl popper concluded that  most mathematical theories are  like those of
and   -  pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures  than it seemed even recently   other thinkers  notably   have applied a version of
to mathematics itself 
an alternative view is that certain scientific fields  such as   are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality  the theoretical physicist
proposed that science is public knowledge  and thus includes mathematics  mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences  notably the
of assumptions 
and
also play a role in the formulation of
in both mathematics and the  other  sciences 
continues to grow in importance within mathematics  and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics 
the opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied  many mathematicians   feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side  and its history in the traditional seven   others   feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and
has driven much development in mathematics  one way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created  as in art  or discovered  as in science   it is common to see
divided into sections that include a division of science and mathematics  indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide  in practice  mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels  this is one of many issues considered in the    
inspiration  pure and applied mathematics  and aesthetics

 right   developers of infinitesimal calculus
mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems  at first these were found in    
and later   today  all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians  and many problems arise within mathematics itself  for example  the
invented the
of
using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight  and today s   a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four   continues to inspire new mathematics 
some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it  and is applied to solve further problems in that area  but often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas  and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts  a distinction is often made between
and   however pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications  e g 
in   this remarkable fact  that even the  purest  mathematics often turns out to have practical applications  is what
has called     as in most areas of study  the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization  there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest
runs to 46pages  several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right  including     and  
for those who are mathematically inclined  there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics  many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics  its intrinsic
and inner  
and generality are valued  there is beauty in a simple and elegant   such as  s proof that there are infinitely many   and in an elegant
that speeds calculation  such as the  
in
expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are  in themselves  sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics  he identified criteria such as significance  unexpectedness  inevitability  and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic  mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant  proofs from  the book  of god according to   the popularity of
is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions 
notation  language  and rigor
main article 
  who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today
most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century  before that  mathematics was written out in words  limiting mathematical discovery 
 17071783  was responsible for many of the notations in use today  modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional  but beginners often find it daunting  it is compressed  a few symbols contain a great deal of information  like   modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way 
can be difficult to understand for beginners  common words such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech  moreover  words such as
and
have specialized mathematical meanings  technical terms such as
and
have precise meanings in mathematics  additionally  shorthand phrases such as iff for    belong to   there is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary  mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech  mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as  rigor  
is fundamentally a matter of   mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning  this is to avoid mistaken     based on fallible intuitions  of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject  the level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time  the greeks expected detailed arguments  but at the time of
the methods employed were less rigorous  problems inherent in the definitions used by newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19thcentury  misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics  today  mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about   since large computations are hard to verify  such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous 
in traditional thought were  self-evident truths   but that conception is problematic  at a formal level  an axiom is just a string of symbols  which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an   it was the goal of
to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis  but according to
every  sufficiently powerful  axiomatic system has
formulas  and so a final
of mathematics is impossible  nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be  as far as its formal content  nothing but
in some axiomatization  in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory

structure
many mathematical objects  such as

or
that are defined on the set  mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure  for instance
studies properties of the set of
that can be expressed in terms of
operations  moreover  it frequently happens that different such structured sets  or   exhibit similar properties  which makes it possible  by a further step of   to state
for a class of structures  and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms  thus one can study    
and other abstract systems  together such studies  for structures defined by algebraic operations  constitute the domain of  
by its great generality  abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems  for instance a number of ancient problems concerning
were finally solved using   which involves field theory and group theory  another example of an algebraic theory is   which is the general study of   whose elements called
have both quantity and direction  and can be used to model  relations between  points in space  this is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of

specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems  as a profession focused on practical problems  applied mathematics focuses on the  formulation  study  and use of mathematical models  in     and other areas of mathematical practice 
in the past  practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories  which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics  where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake  thus  the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in  
statistics and other decision sciences
