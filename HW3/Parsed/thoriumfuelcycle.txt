history  
concerns about the
motivated initial interest in the thorium fuel cycle  it was envisioned that as uranium reserves were depleted  thorium would supplement uranium as a fertile material  however  for most countries uranium was relatively abundant and research in thorium fuel cycles waned  a notable exception was   in the twenty-first century thorium s potential for improving proliferation resistance and
characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle 
at
in the 1960s  the
used 233u as the fissile fuel as an experiment to demonstrate a part of the molten salt breeder reactor that was designed to operate on the thorium fuel cycle 
 msr  experiments assessed thorium s feasibility  using
dissolved in a
fluid that eliminated the need to fabricate fuel elements  the msr program was defunded in 1976 after its patron
was fired 
in 2006 
proposed the concept of an
or  accelerator driven system   ads   which he saw as a novel and safe way to produce nuclear energy that exploited existing accelerator technologies  rubbia s proposal offered the potential to incinerate high-activity nuclear waste and produce energy from natural
and depleted  
  former nasa scientist and chief nuclear technologist at   has been a long-time promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly
 lftrs   he first researched thorium reactors while working at   while evaluating power plant designs suitable for lunar colonies  in 2006 sorensen started  energyfromthorium com  to promote and make information available about this technology 
a 2011 mit study concluded that although there is little in the way of barriers to a thorium fuel cycle  with current or near term light-water reactor designs there is also little incentive for any significant market penetration to occur  as such they conclude there is little chance of thorium cycles replacing conventional uranium cycles in the current nuclear power market  despite the potential benefits 
nuclear reactions with thorium  
 thorium is like wet wood  it  needs to be turned into fissile uranium just as wet wood needs to be
in a furnace

fission product wastes  
produces radioactive
which can have half-lives from
to   according to some toxicity studies  the thorium cycle can fully recycle actinide wastes and only emit fission product wastes  and after a few hundred years  the waste from a thorium reactor can be less toxic than the
that would have been used to produce
fuel for a
of the same power  other studies assume some actinide losses and find that actinide wastes dominate thorium cycle waste radioactivity at some future periods 
actinide wastes  
in a reactor  when a neutron hits a fissile atom  such as certain isotopes of uranium   it either splits the nucleus or is captured and transmutes the atom  in the case of 233u  the transmutations tend to produce useful nuclear fuels rather than
wastes  when 233u absorbs a neutron  it either fissions or becomes   the chance of fissioning on absorption of a
is about 92   the capture-to-fission ratio of 233u  therefore  is about 1 12  which is better than the corresponding capture vs  fission ratios of
 about 1 6   or 239pu or
 both about 1 3   the result is less
waste than in a reactor using the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle

thorium-cycle fuels produce hard   which damage electronics  limiting their use in military bomb triggers  232u cannot be chemically separated from 233u from   however  chemical separation of thorium from uranium removes the decay product 228th and the radiation from the rest of the decay chain  which gradually build up as 228th reaccumulates  the hard gamma emissions also create a radiological hazard which requires remote handling during reprocessing 
nuclear fuel  
as a fertile material thorium is similar to 238u  the major part of natural and depleted uranium  the thermal neutron absorption
 a  and
 average of neutron cross sections over intermediate neutron energies  for 232th are about three and one third times those of the respective values for 238u 
advantages  
thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in earth s crust  although present knowledge of
is limited  current demand for thorium has been satisfied as a by-product of
extraction from
sands 
although the thermal neutron fission cross section  f  of the resulting 233u is comparable to 235u and 239pu  it has a much lower capture cross section    than the latter two fissile isotopes  providing fewer non-fissile neutron absorptions and improved   finally  the ratio of neutrons released per neutron absorbed    in 233u is greater than two over a wide range of energies  including the thermal spectrum  as a result  thorium-based fuels can be the basis for a   a breeding reactor in the uranium - plutonium cycle needs to use a fast neutron spectrum  because in the thermal spectrum one neutron absorbed by 239pu on average leads to less than two neutrons 
thorium-based fuels also display favorable physical and chemical properties that improve reactor and
performance  compared to the predominant reactor fuel

and  unlike uranium dioxide  does not further  
because the 233u produced in thorium fuels is significantly contaminated with 232u in proposed power reactor designs  thorium-based
possesses inherent
resistance  232u cannot be
from 233u and has several
that emit high-energy   these high-energy photons are a
that necessitate the use of
of separated uranium and aid in the passive
of such materials 
the long-term  on the order of roughly 7003100000000000000103 to 7013315576000000000106years  radiological hazard of conventional uranium-based used nuclear fuel is dominated by plutonium and other   after which
become significant contributors again  a single neutron capture in 238u is sufficient to produce   whereas five captures are generally necessary to do so from 232th  9899  of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either 233u or 235u  so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced  because of this  thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in
to minimize the generation of transuranics and maximize the destruction of plutonium 
disadvantages  
there are several challenges to the application of thorium as a nuclear fuel  particularly for solid fuel reactors 
in contrast to uranium  naturally occurring thorium is effectively
and contains no fissile isotopes  fissile material  generally 233u  235u or plutonium  must be added to achieve   this  along with the high
temperature necessary to make thorium-dioxide fuel  complicates fuel fabrication 
experimented with
as fuel in a
from 19641969  which was expected to be easier to process and separate from contaminants that slow or stop the chain reaction 
in an
 i e  utilizing 233u in situ   higher
is necessary to achieve a favorable   although thorium dioxide performed well at burnups of 170,000 mwd t and 150,000 mwd t at
and
respectively  challenges complicate achieving this in
 lwr   which compose the vast majority of existing power reactors 
in a once-through thorium fuel cycle the residual 233u is a long-lived radioactive isotope in the waste 
another challenge associated with the thorium fuel cycle is the comparatively long interval over which 232th breeds to 233u  the
of 233pa is about 27 days  which is an order of magnitude longer than the half-life of   as a result  substantial 233pa develops in thorium-based fuels  233pa is a significant
and  although it eventually
into fissile 235u  this requires two more neutron absorptions  which degrades
and increases the likelihood of
production 
alternatively  if solid thorium is used in a
in which 233u is  
is necessary for fuel fabrication because of the high radiation levels resulting from the
of 232u  this is also true of recycled thorium because of the presence of 228th  which is part of the 232u decay sequence  further  unlike proven uranium fuel recycling technology  e g     recycling technology for thorium  e g  thorex  is only under development 
although the presence of 232u complicates matters  there are public documents showing that 233u has been used once in a
test  the united states tested a composite 233u-plutonium bomb core in the met  military effects test  blast during
in 1955  though with much lower yield than expected 
though thorium-based fuels produce far less long-lived
than uranium-based fuels  some long-lived
products constitute a long-term radiological impact  especially 231pa 
advocates for liquid core and
such as
claim that these technologies negate thorium s disadvantages present in solid fueled reactors  as only two liquid-core fluoride salt reactors have been built  the ornl
and   and neither have used thorium  it is hard to validate the exact benefits
