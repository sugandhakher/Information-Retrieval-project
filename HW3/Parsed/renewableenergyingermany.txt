the german government reported  in 2011  renewable energy  mainly wind turbines and biomass plants  generated more than 123twh of electricity  providing nearly 20  of the 603twh of electricity supplied 
in 2012  all renewable energy accounted for 21.9  of electricity  with wind turbines and photovoltaic providing 11.9  of the total 
chancellor   along with a vast majority of her compatriots  believes   as the first big industrialized nation  we can achieve such a transformation toward efficient and renewable energies  with all the opportunities that brings for exports  developing new technologies and jobs  
as of 2014  renewable sources account for 30.8  of the net electricity production  first half-year   compared to the same period of 2013  energy production from wind  solar and biomass increased by 9.9 twh  while it decreased from fossil fuels by 14.8 twh  and remained almost unchanged for nuclear and hydro power

as of the end of 2014  renewable energy sources  such as biomass  biogas  biofuels  hydro  wind and solar  accounted for 11.1  of the country s primary energy consumption  a more than doubling compared to 2004  when renewables only contributed 4.5   renewable contribute most to the electricity sector with 27.8   gross-generation   followed by the heat and transportation sector with 9.9  and 5.4   respectively  5
although the terms  energy  and  electricity  are often used interchangeably  they should not be confused with one another  as electricity is only one form of energy and does not account for the energy consumed by combustion engines and heat boilers  used in transportation by vehicles and for the heating of buildings

in 2013  wind power generated a total of 53.4 twh of electricity and more than 3.2 gw of new capacity was added to the grid  in 2011  the country s installed capacity of wind power reached 29,075
 mw   about 8  of the overall capacity  according to   in a normal wind year  installed wind capacity in germany will meet 10.6  at end 2011 and 9.3  at end 2010 of the german electricity needs 
more than 21,607 wind turbines are located in the german federal area and the country has plans to build more  as of 2011  germany s federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization  with a particular focus on   a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany  in 2016  germany decided to replace feed-in tariffs with auctions from 2017 
biomass  
the key provider of biomass supply in germany is supposed to be agriculture  moreover  40  of german wood production is also used as a biomass feedstock  the german federal research centre for forestry and forest products claims that there are also reserves which may assist in enlarging the part of forestry in biomass production  agriculture is the main source of rapeseed oil  which is used for the production of biodiesel and making substrates for the production of biogas 
used for the production of
and
are some of germany s most important sources of renewable energy  in 2010  biomass accounted for 30  of renewable electricity generation and for 70  of all renewable energy  mostly wood

solar power  installed capacity in mw  20002014 
solar photovoltaic  pv  technology generates electricity from sunlight  and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications  they were first mass-produced in the year 2000  when german environmentalists and
have succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program  in july 2012  a cumulative installed total solar pv power of 29.7 gw was in place  solar pv provided 18twh in 2011  3  of the total electricity demand  as solar power installations rise quickly  in first half of 2012  about 5.3  of the total electricity demand was covered by solar power  on saturday may 25  2012  solar power broke a new record high  feeding 22 gw into the power grid  or as much as 20 nuclear power stations  this jump above the 20 gw level was due to increased capacity and excellent weather conditions countrywide  and made up for half of the nation s electricity demand at midday  germany was also the biggest expanding market for solar pv 2012  with 7.6 gw of newly connected systems  some market analysts expect the solar electricity share could reach 25  by 2050  price of pv systems has decreased more than 50  in 5years since 2006 
hydroelectricity  
the total installed
capacity in germany at the end of 2006 was 4.7 gw  hydropower meets 3.5  of the electricity demand  latest estimates show  in germany in 2007  about 9,400 people were employed in the hydropower sector which generated a total turnover of 1.23 billion 
geothermal power  
main article 
geothermal power in germany is expected to grow  mainly because of a law that benefits the production of
and guarantees a   but after a renewable energy law that introduced a tariff scheme of 0.15  us 0.23  per
 kwh  for electricity produced from geothermal sources came into effect that year  a construction boom was sparked and the new power plants are now starting to come online

germany s renewable energy sector is among the most innovative and successful worldwide      repower systems    and fuhrlnder are wind-power companies based in germany      and
are solar-power companies based in germany  these companies dominate   the world market  every third solar panel and every second wind rotor in germany are german  and german turbines and generators used in hydro energy generation are among the most popular worldwide 
nearly 800,000 people work in the german environment technology sector  an estimated 214,000 people work with renewables in germany  up from 157,000 in 2004  an increase of 36  
siemens chief executive peter lscher believes germanys target of generating 35  of its energy from renewables by 2020 is achievable  and  most probably  profitable for europes largest engineering company  its environmental solutions portfolio  which is firmly focused on renewables  is already generating more than 27 billion a year  35 per cent of siemens total revenue  and the plan is to grow this to 40 billion by 2015  ending its involvement in nuclear industry will boost the credibility of siemens as a purveyor of green technology

government policy  
the renewable energy sector benefited when the
party joined the
between 1998 and 2005  support for renewable energy continued under all following governments  regardless of composition  including the current cdu csu and spd coalition government starting in 2013  the renewable energy sector was aided especially by the renewable energy sources act that promotes renewable energy mainly by stipulating
and recently also market premiums that grid operators must pay for renewable energy fed into the power grid  people who produce renewable energy can sell their  product  at fixed prices for a period of 20 or 15years  this has created a surge in the production of renewable energy  in 2012 
estimated the total cost of renewable energy would come to at least 1.4trillion  us 1.8trillion  by 2030 
for the 20112014 period  the federal government set aside 3.5billion
for scientific research in the country  additionally  in 2001 a law was passed requiring the closing of all nuclear power plants within a period of 32years  the shutdown time was extended to 2040 by a new government in 2010  after the fukushima incident  the law was abrogated and the end of
was set to 2022  after the 2013 federal elections  the new cdu csu and spd coalition in important areas continued the energiewende of the previous government  but also agreed on a major revision of the eeg 
the german energy policy is framed within the european union  and the march 2007
in
approved a mandatory energy plan that requires a 20  reduction of carbon dioxide emissions before the year 2020 and the consumption of renewable energies to be 20  of total eu consumption  compared to 7  in 2006   the accord indirectly acknowledged the role of
 which is   but
 in the reduction of the emission of   allowing each member state to decide whether or not to use nuclear-generated electricity 
also  a compromise was reached to achieve a minimum quota of 10

the policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables  particularly wind power  germany s share of renewables has increased from around 5  in 1999 to 22.9  in 2012  reaching close to the oecd average of 18  usage of renewables  producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years  guaranteeing a fixed income  energy co-operatives have been created  and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits  the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market  nuclear power plants were closed  and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned  in 2022 
in may 2013  the
commended germany for its commitment to developing a comprehensive energy transition strategy  ambitious renewable energy goals  and plans to increase efficient energy use and supported this approach  nevertheless  the scale of germanys energy policy ambitions  coupled with the large size and energy intensity of its economy  and its central location in europes energy system  mean further policy measures must be developed if the countrys ambitious energy transition is to maintain a workable balance between sustainability  affordability  and competitiveness 
subsidies aimed at stimulating the growth of renewables have driven up consumer energy prices by 12.5  in 2013  to date  german consumers have absorbed the costs of the energiewende  but the iea says the debate over the social and economic impacts of the new approach has become more prominent as the share of renewable energy has continued to grow alongside rising electricity prices  the transition to a low-carbon energy sector requires public acceptance  and  therefore  retail electricity prices must remain at an affordable level  presently  german electricity prices are among the highest in europe  despite relatively low wholesale prices  at the same time  the iea said the new energy policy is based on long-term investment decisions  and a strong policy consensus in germany in favour of large-scale renewable energy commercialisation exists 
ownership  
in germany  almost half of renewable power capacity was citizen-owned as of 2013  and about 20 million germans lived in so-called 100  renewable energy regions
