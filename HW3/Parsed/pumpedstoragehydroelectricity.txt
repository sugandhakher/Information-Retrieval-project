pumped-storage hydroelectricity  psh   or pumped hydroelectric energy storage  phes   is a type of
used by
for   the method stores energy in the form of
of water  pumped from a lower elevation
to a higher elevation  low-cost off-peak electric power is used to run the pumps  during periods of high electrical demand  the stored water is released through
to produce electric power  although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall  the system increases
by selling more electricity during periods of   when electricity prices are highest  pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from time-inflexible sources  such as     and   to be saved for periods of higher demand 
pumped storage is the largest-capacity form of
available  and  as of march 2012  the
 epri  reports that psh accounts for more than 99  of bulk production capacity worldwide  representing around 127   with storage capacity at 740     typically  the round-trip
of psh varies in practice between 70  and 80   with some claiming up to 87   the main disadvantage of phs is the specialist nature of the site required  needing both geographical height and water availability  suitable sites are therefore likely to be in hilly or mountainous regions  and potentially in areas of outstanding natural beauty  and therefore there are also social and ecological issues to overcome

overview  
power distribution  over a day  of a pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility  green represents power consumed in pumping  red is power generated 
at times of low electrical demand  excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir  when there is higher demand  water is released back into the lower reservoir through a   generating electricity  reversible turbine generator assemblies act as pump and turbine  usually a
design   nearly all facilities use the height difference between two natural bodies of water or artificial reservoirs  pure pumped-storage plants just shift the water between reservoirs  while the  pump-back  approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional
that use natural stream-flow  plants that do not use pumped-storage are referred to as conventional hydroelectric plants  conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the
as pumped storage  by deferring output until needed 
taking into account evaporation losses from the exposed water surface and conversion losses  energy recovery of 80  or more can be regained  the technique is currently the most cost-effective means of storing large amounts of electrical energy on an operating basis  but capital costs and the presence of appropriate geography are critical decision factors 
the relatively low energy density of pumped storage systems requires either large flows or a large differences in height  the only way to store a significant amount of energy is by having a large body of water located relatively near  but as high above as possible  a second body of water  in some places this occurs naturally  in others one or both bodies of water were man-made  projects in which both reservoirs are artificial and in which no natural waterways are involved are commonly referred to as  closed loop  
this system may be economical because it flattens out load variations on the power grid  permitting thermal power stations such as
and
that provide base-load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency     while reducing the need for  peaking  power plants that use the same fuels as many base-load thermal plants  gas and oil  but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal thermal efficiency  hence pumped storage systems are crucial when   however  capital costs for purpose-built hydrostorage are relatively high 
along with energy management  pumped storage systems help control electrical network
and provide reserve generation  thermal plants are much less able to respond to sudden changes in electrical demand  potentially causing frequency and
instability  pumped storage plants  like other hydroelectric plants  can respond to load changes within seconds 
the upper reservoir  llyn stwlan  and dam of the
in north   the lower power station has four water turbines which generate 360 mw of electricity within 60 seconds of the need arising 
the first use of pumped storage was in the 1890s in
and   in the 1930s reversible hydroelectric turbines became available  these turbines could operate as both turbine-generators and in reverse as electric motor driven pumps  the latest in large-scale engineering technology are variable speed machines for greater efficiency  these machines generate in synchronization with the network frequency  but operate
 independent of the network frequency  as motor-pumps 
the first use of pumped-storage in the united states was in 1930 by the connecticut electric and power company  using a large reservoir located near new milford  connecticut  pumping water from the housatonic river to the storage reservoir 230 feet above 
the important use for pumped storage is to level the fluctuating output of   the pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand  enabling additional system peak capacity  in certain jurisdictions 
may be close to zero or occasionally negative   in early september  2006   on occasions that there is more electrical generation than load available to absorb it  although at present this is rarely due to
alone  increased wind generation may increase the likelihood of such occurrences  it is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large scale
generation

in 2009  world pumped storage generating capacity was 104   while other sources claim 127 gw  which comprises the vast majority of all types of utility grade electric storage  the
had 38.3 gw net capacity  36.8  of world capacity  out of a total of 140 gw of hydropower and representing 5  of total net electrical capacity in the eu 
had 25.5 gw net capacity  24.5  of world capacity  
in 2010 the united states had 21.5
of pumped storage generating capacity  20.6  of world capacity   phs generated  net  -5.501 gwh of energy in 2010 in the us because more energy is consumed in pumping than is generated

 mwh  is a different intrinsic property and can not be derived from the above given figures 
potential technologies  
sea water  
one can use pumped
to store the energy  the 30 mw
in okinawa was the first demonstration of seawater pumped storage  a 300 mw seawater-based project has recently been proposed on lanai  hawaii  and several seawater-based projects have recently been proposed in
and   another potential example of this could be used in a
or tidal lagoon  a potential benefit of this arises if seawater is allowed to flow behind the barrage or into the lagoon at high tide when the water level is roughly equal either side of the barrier  when the potential energy difference is close to zero  then water is released at low tide when a
of water has been built up behind the barrier  when there is a far greater potential energy difference between the two bodies of water  the result being that when the energy used to pump the water is recovered  it will have multiplied to a degree depending on the head of water built up  a further enhancement is to pump more water at high tide further increasing the head with for example intermittent renewables  two downsides are that the generator must be below sea level  and that marine organisms would tend to grow on the equipment and disrupt operation  this is not a major problem for the edf

direct pumping  
a new concept is to use
or
to drive water pumps directly  in effect an  energy storing wind or solar dam   this could provide a more efficient process and usefully smooth out the variability of energy captured from the wind or sun    in northern   the espejo de tarapac project is a power project of   that combines solar and hydroelectric resources  the project takes advantage of the unique geographic characteristics of the atacama desert in order to build a 300 mw pumped storage hydroelectric plant that uses the pacific ocean as its lower reservoir and an existing natural concavity as its upper reservoir  and a 600 mw-ac solar photovoltaic plant that is located in the region with the highest solar irradiation in the world  the above characteristics minimize the environmental impact and the cost of the plant  which is usd 400 mm for the pumped storage and usd 900 mm for the solar power plant 
underground reservoirs  
the use of underground reservoirs has been investigated  recent examples include the proposed summit project in   the proposed maysville project in kentucky  underground limestone mine   and the mount hope project in new jersey  which was to have used a former iron mine as the lower reservoir  several new underground pumped storage projects have been proposed  cost-per-kilowatt estimates for these projects can be lower than for surface projects if they use existing underground mine space  there are limited opportunities involving suitable underground space  but the number of underground pumped storage opportunities may increase if abandoned coal mines prove suitable 
decentralised systems  
small pumped-storage hydropower plants can be built on streams and within infrastructures  such as drinking water networks and artificial snow making infrastructures  such plants provide distributed
and distributed flexible
and can contribute to the decentralized integration of
technologies  such as
and   reservoirs that can be used for small pumped-storage hydropower plants could include natural or artificial lakes  reservoirs within other structures such as irrigation  or unused portions of mines or underground military installations  in
one study suggested that the total installed capacity of small pumped-storage hydropower plants in 2011 could be increased by 3 to 9 times by providing adequate
