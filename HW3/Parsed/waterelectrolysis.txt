simple setup for demonstration of electrolysis of water at home
electrolysis of water is the
 h2o  into
 o2  and
gas  h2  due to an
being passed through the water  the reaction has a standard potential of 1.23 v  meaning it ideally requires a potential difference of 1.23 volts to split water 
this technique can be used to make
 hydrogen gas  and breathable oxygen  though currently most industrial methods make hydrogen fuel from
instead

history  
device invented by
to develop the electrolysis of water
jan rudolph deiman and adriaan paets van troostwijk used  in 1789  an electrostatic machine to produce electricity which was discharged on gold electrodes in a
with water  in 1800
invented the   and a few weeks later
and
used it for the electrolysis of water  when
invented the
in 1869 electrolysis of water became a cheap method for the production of hydrogen  a method of industrial synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis was developed by
in 1888 
principle  
a dc electrical power source is connected to two   or two plates  typically made from some inert metal such as  
or   which are placed in the water  hydrogen will appear at the
 where
enter the water   and oxygen will appear at the   assuming ideal   the
of hydrogen generated is twice the amount of oxygen  and both are
to the total
conducted by the solution  however  in many cells
occur  resulting in different products and less than ideal faradaic efficiency 
of pure water requires excess energy in the form of
to overcome various activation barriers  without the excess energy the electrolysis of pure water occurs very slowly or not at all  this is in part due to the limited   pure water has an
about one millionth that of seawater  many
may also lack the requisite   the efficiency of electrolysis is increased through the addition of an
 such as a   an
or a   and the use of  
currently the
is rarely used in industrial applications since hydrogen can currently be produced more affordably from  
equations  
diagram showing the overall  
in pure water at the negatively charged cathode  a
reaction takes place  with electrons  e  from the cathode being given to hydrogen cations to form hydrogen gas  the half reaction balanced with acid  
reduction at cathode  2 h      2e  h2  
at the positively charged anode  an
reaction occurs  generating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the circuit 
oxidation at anode  2 h2o    o2 g    4 h  aq    4e
the same half reactions can also be balanced with base as listed below  not all half reactions must be balanced with acid or base  many do  like the oxidation or reduction of water listed here  to add half reactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base 
cathode  reduction   2 h2o l    2e  h2 g    2 oh aq 
anode  oxidation   4 oh aq   o2 g    2 h2o l    4 e
combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen 
overall reaction  2 h2o l   2 h2 g    o2 g 
the number of hydrogen molecules produced is thus twice the number of oxygen molecules  assuming equal temperature and pressure for both gases  the produced hydrogen gas has therefore twice the volume of the produced oxygen gas  the number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number of generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated oxygen molecules 
thermodynamics  
decomposition of pure water into hydrogen and oxygen at
is not favorable in
terms 
anode  oxidation   2 h2o l   o2 g    4 h  aq    4e eo
ox   -1.23 v  eo
red   1.23   
cathode  reduction   2 h  aq    2e  h2 g  eo
red   0.00 v
thus  the standard potential of the water electrolysis cell is 1.23 v at 25c at ph 0   h     1.0 m   at 25c with ph 7   h     1.0107 m   the potential is unchanged based on the   the thermodynamic standard cell potential can be obtained from standard-state free energy calculations to find g and then using the equation  g  -nfe where e is the cell potential   in practice when an electrochemical cell is  driven  toward completion by applying reasonable potential  it is kinetically controlled  therefore  activation energy  ion mobility  diffusion  and concentration  wire resistance  surface hindrance including bubble formation  causes electrode area blockage   and entropy  require a greater applied potential to overcome these factors 
electrolyte selection  
connected to a
if the above described processes occur in pure water  h 
will accumulate at the cathode and oh
will accumulate at the anode  this can be verified by adding a
to the water  the water near the cathode is acidic while the water near the anode is basic  the negative hydroxide ions that approach the anode mostly combine with the positive hydronium ions  h3o   to form water  the positive hydronium ions that approach the cathode mostly combine with negative hydroxide ions to form water  relatively few hydronium hydroxide ions reach the cathode anode  this can cause a concentration overpotential at both electrodes 
pure water is a fairly good insulator since it has a low   kw   1.01014 at room temperature and thus pure water conducts current poorly  0.055 scm1  unless a very large potential is applied to cause an increase in the autoionization of water the electrolysis of pure water proceeds very slowly limited by the overall conductivity 
if a water-soluble electrolyte is added  the conductivity of the water rises considerably  the electrolyte disassociates into
and anions  the anions rush towards the anode and neutralize the buildup of positively charged h  there  similarly  the cations rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of negatively charged oh there  this allows the continued flow of electricity 
care must be taken in choosing an electrolyte  since an anion from the electrolyte is in competition with the hydroxide ions to give up an   an electrolyte anion with less
than hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide  and no oxygen gas will be produced  a
with a greater
than a hydrogen ion will be reduced in its stead  and no hydrogen gas will be produced 
the following
have lower
than h  and are therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cations              2   2   2      and 2  
and
are frequently used  as they form inexpensive  soluble salts 
if an
is used as the electrolyte  the cation is h   and there is no competitor for the h  created by disassociating water  the most commonly used anion is
 so2
4   as it is very difficult to oxidize  with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the
ion being 2.05 volts 
strong acids such as
 h2so4   and strong bases such as
 koh   and
 naoh  are frequently used as electrolytes due to their strong conducting abilities 
a solid polymer electrolyte can also be used such as
and when applied with a special catalyst on each side of the membrane can efficiently split the water molecule with as little as 1.5 volts  there are also a number of other solid electrolyte systems that have been trialled and developed with a number of electrolysis systems now available commercially that use solid electrolytes 
techniques  
main article 
fundamental demonstration  
two   running from the terminals of a battery  are placed in a cup of water with a quantity of electrolyte to establish conductivity in the solution  using nacl  table salt  in an electrolyte solution results in
gas rather than oxygen due to a   with the correct electrodes and correct electrolyte  such as baking soda     hydrogen and oxygen gases will stream from the oppositely charged   oxygen will collect at the positively charged electrode    and hydrogen will collect at the negatively charged electrode     note that hydrogen is positively charged in the h2o molecule  so it ends up at the negative electrode   and vice versa for oxygen  
note that an aqueous solution of water with chloride ions  when electrolysed  will result in either oh if the concentration of cl is low  or in chlorine gas being preferentially discharged if the concentration of cl is greater than 25  by mass in the solution 
match test used to detect the presence of hydrogen gas
hofmann voltameter  
main article 
the hofmann voltameter is often used as a small-scale electrolytic cell  it consists of three joined upright cylinders  the inner cylinder is open at the top to allow the addition of water and the electrolyte  a
electrode is placed at the bottom of each of the two side cylinders  connected to the positive and negative terminals of a source of   when current is run through the hofmann voltameter  gaseous oxygen forms at the
 positive  and gaseous hydrogen at the
 negative   each gas displaces water and collects at the top of the two outer tubes  where it can be drawn off with a stopcock 
industrial  
many industrial electrolysis cells are very similar to   with complex platinum plates or honeycombs as electrodes  generally the only time hydrogen is intentionally produced from electrolysis is for specific point of use application such as is the case with
torches or when extremely
or oxygen is desired  the vast majority of hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons and as a result contains trace amounts of
among other impurities  the carbon monoxide impurity can be detrimental to various systems including many  
high pressure  
main article 
high pressure electrolysis is the electrolysis of water with a
output around 120200
 17402900    by pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser  the need for an external
is eliminated  the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3  
high-temperature  
main article 
high-temperature electrolysis  also hte or steam electrolysis  is a method currently being investigated for water electrolysis with a   high temperature electrolysis may be preferable to traditional room-temperature electrolysis because some of the energy is supplied as heat  which is cheaper than electricity  and because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures

nickel iron  
in 2014  researchers announced an electrolysis system made of inexpensive  abundant nickel and iron rather than precious metal catalysts  such as platinum or iridium  the nickel-metal nickel-oxide structure is more active than pure nickel metal or pure nickel oxide alone  the catalyst significantly lowers the required  
applications  
about five percent of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is created by electrolysis  the majority of this hydrogen produced through electrolysis is a side product in the production of
and   this is a prime example of a  
2nacl   2h2o  cl2   h2   2naoh
the electrolysis of
 saltwater   a water sodium chloride mixture  is only half the electrolysis of water since the
ions are oxidized to
rather than water being oxidized to oxygen  the hydrogen produced from this process is either burned  converting it back to water   used for the production of   or various other small-scale applications 
water electrolysis is also used to generate oxygen for the  
hydrogen may later be used in a
as a storage method of energy and water 
efficiency  
industrial output  
efficiency of modern hydrogen generators is measured by energy consumed per standard volume of hydrogen  mj m3   assuming
of the h2  the lower the energy used by a generator  the higher would be its efficiency  a 100 -efficient electrolyser would consume 39.4 kilowatt-hours per kilogram  142mj kg  of   12,749 joules per litre  12.75mj m3   practical electrolysis  using a rotating electrolyser at 15 bar pressure  may consume 50 kilowatt-hours per kilogram  180mj kg   and a further 15 kilowatt-hours  54mj  if the hydrogen is compressed for use in hydrogen cars 
electrolyser vendors provide efficiencies based on   to assess the claimed efficiency of an electrolyser it is important to establish how it was defined by the vendor  i e  what enthalpy value  what current density  etc   
there are two main technologies available on the market  alkaline and
 pem  electrolysers  alkaline electrolysers are cheaper in terms of investment  they generally use nickel catalysts   but less efficient  pem electrolysers  conversely  are more expensive  they generally use expensive platinum-group metal catalysts  but are more efficient and can operate at higher current densities  and can therefore be possibly cheaper if the hydrogen production is large enough 
reported working efficiencies were for alkaline in 1996 lying in the 5060  range for the smaller electrolysers and around 6570  for the larger plants  theorical efficiency for pem electrolysers are predicted up to 94   ranges in 2014 were 4367  for the alkaline and 4067  for the pem  they should progress in 2030 to 5370  for the alkaline and 6274  for the pem 
overpotential  
real water electrolysers require higher voltages for the reaction to proceed  the part that exceeds 1.23 v is called
or overvoltage  and represents any kind of loss and nonideality in the electrochemical process 
for a well designed cell the largest
is the
for the four-electron oxidation of water to oxygen at the anode 
can facilitate this reaction  and
alloys are the state of the art for this oxidation  developing a cheap  effective electrocatalyst for this reaction would be a great advance  and is a topic of current research  there are many approaches  among them a 30-year-old recipe for         and nickel nickel-oxide  the simpler two-electron reaction to produce hydrogen at the cathode can be electrocatalyzed with almost no overpotential by platinum  or in theory a   if other  less effective  materials are used for the cathode  e g     large overpotentials will appear 
thermodynamics  
the electrolysis of water in standard conditions requires a theoretical minimum of 237 kj of electrical energy input to dissociate each mole of water  which is the standard
of formation of water  it also requires energy to overcome the change in entropy of the reaction  therefore  the process cannot proceed below 286 kj per mol if no external heat energy is added 
since each mole of water requires two moles of   and given that the
f represents the charge of a mole of electrons  96485 c mol   it follows that the minimum voltage necessary for electrolysis is about 1.23 v  if electrolysis is carried out at high temperature  this voltage reduces  this effectively allows the electrolyser to operate at more than 100  electrical efficiency  in electrochemical systems this means that heat must be supplied to the reactor to sustain the reaction  in this way thermal energy can be used for part of the electrolysis energy requirement  in a similar way the required voltage can be reduced  below 1 v  if fuels  such as carbon  alcohol  biomass  are reacted with water  pem based electrolyzer in low temperature  or oxygen ions  solid oxide electrolyte based electrolyzer in high temperature   this results in some of the fuel s energy being used to  assist  the electrolysis process and can reduce the overall cost of hydrogen produced 
however  observing the entropy component  and other losses   voltages over 1.48 v are required for the reaction to proceed at practical current densities  the thermoneutral voltage  
in the case of water electrolysis  gibbs free energy represents the minimum work necessary for the reaction to proceed  and the reaction enthalpy is the amount of energy  both work and heat  that has to be provided so the reaction products are at the same temperature as the reactant  i e  standard temperature for the values given above   potentially  an electrolyser operating at 1.48 v would be 100  efficient
