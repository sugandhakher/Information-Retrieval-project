and   found primarily on moist
in cold and

sealh  related to the
word salix  willow   some willows  particularly

description  
at the base of the petiole a pair of stipules form  these may fall in spring  or last for much of the summer or even for more than one year    
willows all have abundant watery
  which is heavily charged with   soft  usually pliant  tough   slender branches  and large  fibrous  often
  the roots are remarkable for their toughness  size  and tenacity to life  and roots readily sprout from aerial parts of the plant 
the
are typically elongated  but may also be round to oval  frequently with serrated edges  most species are   semi willows with
leaves are rare  e g  salix micans and s  australior in the eastern   all the buds are lateral  no absolutely terminal bud is ever formed  the buds are covered by a single scale  usually  the bud scale is fused into a cap-like shape  but in some species it wraps around and the edges overlap  the leaves are simple  feather-veined  and typically linear-lanceolate  usually they are serrate  rounded at base  acute or acuminate  the leaf
are short  the
often very conspicuous  resembling tiny  round leaves  and sometimes remaining for half the summer  on some species  however  they are small  inconspicuous  and caducous  soon falling   in color  the leaves show a great variety of greens  ranging from yellowish to bluish 
flowers  
young male catkin
willows are   with male and female
appearing as
on separate plants  the catkins are produced early in the spring  often before the leaves 
the staminate  male  flowers are without either
or   they consist simply of stamens  varying in number from two to 10  accompanied by a nectariferous gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is itself borne on the rachis of a drooping raceme called a catkin  or ament  this scale is square  entire  and very hairy  the anthers are rose-colored in the bud  but orange or purple after the flower opens  they are two-celled and the cells open longitudinally  the filaments are threadlike  usually pale brown  and often bald 
the pistillate  female  flowers are also without calyx or corolla  and consist of a single ovary accompanied by a small  flat nectar gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is likewise borne on the rachis of a catkin  the ovary is one-celled  the style two-lobed  and the ovules numerous 
cultivation  
almost all willows take root very readily from
or where broken branches lie on the ground  the few exceptions include the goat willow    and peachleaf willow     one famous example of such growth from cuttings involves the poet   who begged a twig from a parcel tied with twigs sent from spain to   this twig was planted and thrived  and legend has it that all of england s weeping willows are descended from this first one 
willows are often planted on the borders of streams so their interlacing roots may protect the bank against the action of the water  frequently  the roots are much larger than the stem which grows from them 
hybrids  
willows are very cross-compatible  and numerous
occur  both naturally and in cultivation  a well-known
example is the
 salix  sepulcralis   which is a hybrid of peking willow    from china and white willow    from europe 
the hybrid
 boydii  has gained the  s

a small number of willow species were widely planted in australia  notably as -control measures along watercourses  they are now regarded as invasive   and many catchment management authorities are removing and replacing them with native trees 
willow roots spread widely and are very aggressive in seeking out moisture  for this reason  they can become problematic when planted in residential areas  where the roots are notorious for clogging           and   particularly older    newer 
are much less leaky at the joints  and are therefore less susceptible to problems from willow roots  the same is true of
piping 
pests and diseases  
willow species are hosts to more than a hundred
species  belonging to chaitophorus and other genera  forming large colonies to feed on plant juices  on the underside of leaves in particular    the willow lace bug  is a bug species in the family tingidae found on willows in north america
