history
in  
is the site of early
of several food crops  including
 an ancestor of maize  
most historians believe maize was domesticated in the
of   recent research modified this view somewhat  scholars now indicate the adjacent
valley of south-central mexico as the center of domestication 
the
and
cultivated maize in numerous varieties throughout mesoamerica  cooked  ground or processed through   beginning about 2500 bc  the crop spread through much of the   the region developed a trade network based on surplus and varieties of maize crops 
nevertheless  recent data indicates that the spread of maize took place even earlier  according to piperno 
 a large corpus of data indicates that it  maize  was dispersed into lower central america by 7600 bp  5600 bc  and had moved into the inter-andean valleys of colombia between 7000 and 6000 bp  5000-4000 bc   
since then  even earlier dates have been published 
after european contact with the americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries  explorers and traders
and introduced it to other countries  maize spread to the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates  sugar-rich varieties called
are usually grown for human consumption as kernels  while
varieties are used for animal feed  various corn-based human food uses  including grinding into
or   pressing into   and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like    and as chemical feedstocks 
an influential 2002 study by matsuoka et al  has demonstrated that  rather than the multiple independent domestications model  all maize arose from a single domestication in southern mexico about 9,000 years ago  the study also demonstrated that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the mexican highlands  later  maize spread from this region over the americas along two major paths  this is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of mexico before spreading to the lowlands 
before they were domesticated  maize plants only grew small  25 millimetres  1in  long corn cobs  and only one per plant  many centuries of artificial selection by the indigenous people of the americas resulted in the development of maize plants capable of growing several cobs per plant that were usually several centimetres inches long each 
maize is the most widely grown grain
throughout the americas  with 332 million
grown annually in the united states alone  approximately 40  of the crop130 million tonsis used for corn  
made up 85  of the maize planted in the united states in 2009 
names
many small male flowers make up the male inflorescence  called the tassel 
the word maize derives from the spanish form of the indigenous
word for the plant  mahiz  it is known by other names around the world 
the word  corn  outside north america  australia  and new zealand refers to any
crop  its meaning understood to vary geographically to refer to the local   in the united states  canada  australia  and new zealand    corn primarily means maize  this usage started as a shortening of  indian corn    indian corn  primarily means maize  the staple grain of    but can refer more specifically to multicolored    used for decoration 
in places outside north america  australia  and new zealand  corn often refers to maize in culinary contexts  the narrower meaning is usually indicated by some additional word  as in   sweetcorn      the puffed confection known as
and the breakfast cereal known as  
in southern africa  maize is commonly called mielie    or mealie     words derived from the portuguese word for maize  milho 
maize is preferred in formal  scientific  and international usage because it refers specifically to this one grain  unlike corn  which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region  maize is used by agricultural bodies and
such as the
and   national agricultural and industry associations often include the word maize in their name even in english-speaking countries where the local  informal word is something other than maize  for example  the maize association of australia  the indian maize development association  the kenya maize consortium and maize breeders network  the national maize association of nigeria  the zimbabwe seed maize association  however  in commodities trading  corn consistently refers to maize and not other grains   
structure and physiology
the maize plant is often 3m  10ft  in height  though some natural strains can grow 12m  39ft   the stem is commonly composed of 20
of 18cm  7.1in  length  a leaf  which grows from each node  is generally 9cm  4in  in width and 120cm  4ft  in length 
ears develop above a few of the leaves in the midsection of the plant  between the stem and leaf sheath  elongating by  3mm day  to a length of 18cm  7in 
with 60cm  24in  being the maximum alleged in the subspecies  they are female   tightly enveloped by several layers of ear leaves commonly called husks  certain varieties of maize have been bred to produce many additional developed ears  these are the source of the    used as a vegetable in

 dispersed by wind   and because of its large settling velocity  most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel 
elongated   called   emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear  they are often pale yellow and 18cm  7in  in length  like tufts of hair in appearance  at the end of each is a carpel  which may develop into a  kernel  if fertilized by a pollen grain  the
of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as     typical of the   and the entire kernel is often referred to as the     the cob is close to a
in structure  except that the individual fruits  the kernels  never fuse into a single mass  the grains are about the size of   and adhere in regular rows around a white  pithy substance  which forms the ear  the maximum size of kernels is reputedly 2.5cm  1in   an ear commonly holds 600 kernels  they are of various colors  blackish      green  red  white and yellow  when ground into   maize yields more flour with much less

planting density affects multiple aspects of maize  modern farming techniques in

maize are yet denser  and achieve a lower percentage of ears and more plant matter

  10c  50f  in the environment to which it is adapted  the magnitude of the influence that long nights have on the number of days that must pass before maize
is genetically prescribed and regulated by the
system 
can be eccentric in tropical
such that the long days characteristic of higher latitudes allow the plants to grow so tall that they do not have enough time to produce seed before being killed by frost  these attributes  however  may prove useful in using tropical maize for  
immature maize shoots accumulate a powerful antibiotic substance  2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one     dimboa is a member of a group of
 also known as benzoxazinoids  that serve as a natural defense against a wide range of pests  including insects 
fungi and   dimboa is also found in related grasses  particularly wheat  a maize mutant  bx  lacking dimboa is highly susceptible to attack by
and   dimboa is also responsible for the relative resistance of immature maize to the
 family    as maize matures  dimboa levels and resistance to the corn borer decline 
because of its shallow roots  maize is susceptible to droughts  intolerant of nutrient-deficient soils  and prone to be uprooted by severe winds

breeding

maize reproduces sexually each year  this randomly selects half the genes from a given plant to propagate to the next generation  meaning that desirable traits found in the crop  like high yield or good nutrition  can be lost in subsequent generations unless certain techniques are used 
maize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears  modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers  james l  reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing reid s yellow dent in the 1860s  these early efforts were based on   later breeding efforts included ear to row selection   c  g  hopkins ca  1896   hybrids made from selected

maize is the domesticated variant of   the two plants have dissimilar appearance  maize having a single tall stalk with multiple leaves and teosinte being a short  bushy plant  the difference between the two is largely controlled by differences in just two genes 
several theories had been proposed about the specific origin of maize in mesoamerica 
it is a direct
of a
annual   zea mays ssp  parviglumis  native to the
valley in south-eastern   with up to 12  of its
obtained from zea mays ssp  mexicana through   this theory was further confirmed by the 2002 study of matsuoka et al 
it has been derived from hybridization between a small domesticated maize  a slightly changed form of a wild maize  and a teosinte of section luxuriantes  either z  luxurians or  
it has undergone two or more domestications either of a wild maize or of a teosinte   the term  teosinte  describes all
and subspecies in the genus zea  excluding zea mays ssp  mays  
it has evolved from a hybridization of z  diploperennis by  
in the late 1930s  paul mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of   a related genus  this theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern   which refutes mangelsdorf s model and the fourth listed above  40
the teosinte origin theory was proposed by the russian botanist
in 1931 and the later american -winner
in 1932  10 it is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants  genomes  teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring  a number of questions remain concerning the species  among them 
how the immense diversity of the species of sect  zea originated 
how the tiny archaeological specimens of 35002700 bc could have been selected from a teosinte  and
how domestication could have proceeded without leaving remains of teosinte or maize with teosintoid traits earlier than the earliest known until recently  dating from ca  1100 bc 
the
of maize is of particular interest to researchers      geographers  etc  the process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago  research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of
and   because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known at the time were found there

genetic studies led by
identified zea mays ssp  parviglumis  native to the
valley in mexico s southwestern highlands  and also known as balsas teosinte  as being the
teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize  this has been confirmed by further more recent studies  which refined this hypothesis somewhat  archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the middle part of the balsas river valley as the more likely location of early domestication  this river is not very long  so these locations are not very distant  stone milling tools with maize residue have been found in an 8,700-years old layer of deposits in a cave not far from  
also  doebley was part of the team that is credited with first finding  back in 2002  that maize had been domesticated only once  about 9000 years ago  and then spread throughout the americas 
a primitive corn was being grown in southern mexico  central america  and northern south america 7,000 years ago  archaeological remains of early maize ears  found at
in the   date back roughly 6,250 years  the oldest ears from caves near   puebla  date ca  3,450 bc 
maize pollen dated to 7300 cal b p  from   on the caribbean coast has also been recovered 
as maize was introduced to new cultures  new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations  maize was the staple food  or a major staple  along with   andean region       and
 of most
north american  mesoamerican  south american  and caribbean cultures  the mesoamerican civilization  in particular  was deeply interrelated with maize  its traditions and rituals involved all aspects of maize cultivation  from the planting to the food preparation  maize formed the mesoamerican people s identity 
  the aztec deity of maize
it is unknown what precipitated its domestication  because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly  as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bivalve shell  it is possible that  early on  teosinte may have been gathered as preferred feed for domestic animals 
also  back in 1939  george beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily  popped  for human consumption  like modern popcorn  some have argued it would have taken too many generations of
to produce large  compressed ears for efficient cultivation  however  studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing teosinte and modern maize suggest this objection is not well founded 
spreading to the north
around 2500 bc  maize began to spread to the north  it was first cultivated in what is now the united states at several sites in new mexico and arizona  about 2100 bc 
during the first millennium ad  maize cultivation spread more widely in the areas north  in particular  the large-scale adoption of maize agriculture and consumption in eastern north america took place about a d  900  native americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop 
in 2005  research by the
suggested that the rise in maize cultivation 500 to 1,000 years ago in what is now the southeastern united states corresponded with a decline of freshwater   which are very sensitive to environmental changes

and   maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence  when the flowers are ready for pollination  in the united states  a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize were  knee-high by the    although modern

regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent   although it is grown mainly in wet  hot climates  it has been said to thrive in cold  hot  dry or wet conditions  meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop 
mature plants showing ears
maize was planted by the
in hills  in a complex system known to some as the   maize provided support for   and the beans provided nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixing
bacteria which live on the roots of beans and other   and
provided ground cover to stop weeds and inhibit evaporation by providing shade over the soil  this method was replaced by single species hill planting where each hill 60120cm  2.03.9ft  apart was planted with three or four seeds  a method still used by home gardeners  a later technique was  checked maize   where hills were placed 40in  1.0m  apart in each direction  allowing cultivators to run through the field in two directions  in more arid lands  this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of 1012cm  3.94.7in  deep furrows to collect water  modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young  although the hill technique is still used in the maize fields of some native american reservations  when maize is planted in rows  it also allows for planting of other crops between these rows to make more efficient use of land space 
in north america  fields are often planted in a two- with a

in cooler climates and
in regions with longer summers  sometimes a third crop    is added to the rotation

in midwestern united states  low-till or
techniques are usually used  in low-till  fields are covered once  maybe twice  with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest  the fields are planted and   weeds are controlled through the use of   and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season  this technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil  and thus provides more moisture for the crop  the technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming  weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients  making them undesirable 
mature field maize ears
before   most maize in north america was harvested by hand  this involves a large numbers of workers and associated social events  husking or shucking    some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use  but the maize
was not adopted until after the war  by hand or mechanical picker  the entire ear is harvested  which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear  whole ears of maize were often stored in   and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use  few modern farms store maize in this manner  most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins  the combine with a corn head  with points and snap rolls instead of a reel  does not cut the stalk  it simply pulls the stalk down  the stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground  the ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away  leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery  the combine separates out the husk and the cob  keeping only the kernels 
for storing grain in bins  the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling  if the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high 
are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain  this can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases   or   and electricity to power the blowers

the brazilian dessert
is made by boiling maize kernels in sweetened milk  maize can also be harvested and consumed in the unripe state  when the kernels are fully grown but still soft  unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable  this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob    a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch  is usually consumed in the unripe state  such
is a common dish in the united states  canada  united kingdom    some parts of south america  and the balkans  but virtually unheard of in some european countries  corn on the cob was hawked on the streets of early 19th-century new york city by poor  barefoot   girls   who were thus the precursors of  
wagons  and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today  the cooked  unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a
in side dishes      etc  alternatively  the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes  such as maize             etc 
maize is a major source of  
 maize flour  is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products  maize is also a major source of
   and of maize gluten  maize starch can be
and enzymatically treated to produce syrups  particularly   a sweetener  and also fermented and distilled to produce   grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of   maize is sometimes used as the starch source for   within the united states  the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country  in the united states and canada  maize is mostly grown to feed   as forage 
 made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks   or grain  maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products  such as

fuel source  maize is relatively cheap and home-heating furnaces have been developed which use maize kernels as a fuel  they feature a large hopper that feeds the uniformly sized maize kernels  or wood pellets or
pits  into the fire 
maize is increasingly used as a feedstock for the production of     ethanol is mixed with gasoline to decrease the amount of pollutants emitted when used to fuel motor vehicles  high fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol  which in turn led to higher prices paid to farmers for maize  this led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers  because of the relationship between fuel and maize  prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil   
the price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production  the cost of transportation  production  and marketing are a large portion  80   of the price of food in the united states  higher energy costs affect these costs  especially transportation  the increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost  the effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect  use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand  and therefore price of maize  this  in turn  results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production  this reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices

has increased this debate  considering the bad labor conditions of workers in the fields  and mainly the fact that nafta  opened the doors to the import of maize from the united states  where the farmers who grow it receive multimillion dollar subsidies and other government supports        according to oxfam uk  after nafta went into effect  the price of maize in mexico fell 70  between 1994 and 2001  the number of farm jobs dropped as well  from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002  many of those who found themselves without work were small-scale maize growers     however  introduction in the northern latitudes of the us of   and not for human or animal consumption  may potentially alleviate this 
as a result of the
announcing its production target of 35billion us gallons  130,000,000m3  of biofuels by 2017  ethanol production will grow to 7billion us gallons  26,000,000m3  by 2010  up from 4.5 billion in 2006  boosting ethanol s share of maize demand in the us from 22.6 percent to 36.1 percent

in 1993  traditional mazes are most commonly grown using
  but these take several years to mature  the rapid growth of a field of maize allows a maze to be laid out using
at the start of a growing season and for the maize to grow tall enough to obstruct a visitor s line of sight by the start of the summer  in canada and the us  these are popular in many farming communities

in the us since 2009/2010  maize feedstock use for ethanol production has somewhat exceeded direct use for livestock feed  maize use for fuel ethanol was 5,130 million bushels  130 million tonnes  in the 2013/2014 marketing year 
a fraction of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as ddgs  dried distillers grains with solubles   in the 2010/2011 marketing year  about 29.1 million tonnes of ddgs were fed to us livestock and poultry  because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue  the feed value per kg of ddgs  with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein  exceeds that of the grain  feed value for monogastric animals  such as swine and poultry  is somewhat lower than for ruminants

main article 
when maize was first introduced into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-american peoples  it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity  however  a widespread problem of malnutrition soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a   this was a mystery  since these types of malnutrition were not normally seen among the indigenous americans  for whom maize was the principal staple food 
it was eventually discovered that the indigenous americans had learned to soak maize in -watermade with ashes and lime    since at least 12001500 bc by
and north americanswhich liberates the b-vitamin   the lack of which was the underlying cause of the condition known as  
maize was introduced into the diet of nonindigenous americans without the necessary cultural knowledge acquired over thousands of years in the americas  in the late 19th century  pellagra reached epidemic proportions in parts of the southern us  as medical researchers debated two theories for its origin  the deficiency theory  which was eventually shown to be true  said that pellagra was due to a deficiency of some nutrient  and the germ theory said that pellagra was caused by a germ transmitted by stable flies  a third theory  promoted by the eugenicist   held that people only contracted pellagra if they were susceptible to it due to certain  constitutional  inheritable  traits of the affected individual 
once alkali processing and dietary variety were understood and applied  pellagra disappeared in the developed world  the development of high lysine maize and the promotion of a more balanced diet have also contributed to its demise  pellagra still exists today in food-poor areas and refugee camps where people survive on donated maize 
allergy
maize contains   an indigestible protein that survives cooking  this protein has been linked to a rare and understudied
to maize in humans  the allergic reaction can cause skin rash  swelling or itching of   diarrhea  vomiting 
and  in severe cases    it is unclear how common this allergy is in the general population

maize has been an essential crop in the
since the   the
culture from northern
made ceramics from earth  water  and fire  this pottery was a sacred substance  formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes  maize represented anthropomorphically as well as naturally 
in the united states  maize ears along with tobacco leaves are carved into the capitals of columns in the
building  maize itself is sometimes used for temporary architectural detailing when the intent is to celebrate the fall season  local agricultural productivity and culture  bundles of dried maize stalks are often displayed often along with pumpkins  gourds and straw in autumnal displays outside homes and businesses  a well-known example of architectural use is the
in mitchell  south dakota  which uses cobs and ears of colored maize to implement a mural design that is recycled annually 
a maize stalk with two ripe ears is depicted on the
of the croatian 1
coin  minted since 1993
