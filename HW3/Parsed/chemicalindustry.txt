history  
although chemicals were made and used throughout history  the birth of the heavy chemical industry  production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses  coincided with the beginnings of the
in general 
industrial revolution  
one of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial process was   in 1736  the pharmacist
developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter  allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water  it was the first practical production of sulfuric acid on a large scale 
and
were the first to establish a large-scale factory in   in 1749  which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid 
 s st  rollox chemical works in 1831  then the biggest chemical enterprise in the world 
in the early 18th century  cloth was bleached by treating it with stale
or
and exposing it to
for long periods of time  which created a severe bottleneck in production  sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as
by the middle of the century  but it was the discovery of
by
that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise  his powder was made by reacting
with dry
and proved to be a cheap and successful product  he opened a factory in   north of   and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later 
was used since ancient times in the production of       and   and the source of the
had traditionally been
ashes in   by the 18th century  this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation  and the
offered a prize of 2400
for a method to produce alkali from sea salt     the
was patented in 1791 by
who then built a leblanc plant at   he was denied his prize money because of the  
however  it was in britain that the leblanc process really took off 
built the first soda works in britain at the
works on the
in 1816  but it remained on a small scale due to large
on salt production until 1824  when these tariffs were repealed  the british soda industry was able to rapidly expand   s chemical works in
and charles tennant s complex near
became the largest chemical production centres anywhere  by the 1870s  the british soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined 
  patented an improved industrial method for the manufacture of  
these huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the
matured  originally  large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda  provoking one of the
to be passed in 1863  this provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution  methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali 
the
was developed by the
industrial chemist
in 1861  in 1864  solvay and his brother alfred constructed a plant in the belgian town of
and in 1874  they expanded into a larger plant in   france  the new process proved more economical and less polluting than the leblanc method  and its use spread  in the same year 
visited solvay to acquire the rights to use his process  and he and
formed the firm of   and built a solvay plant at   england  mond was instrumental in making the solvay process a commercial success  he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process 
expansion and maturation  
the late 19th century saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured  large chemical industries also took shape in germany and later in the united states 
the factories of the german firm   in 1866 
production of artificial manufactured
for
was pioneered by sir
at his purpose-built
facility  in the 1840s he established large works near
for the manufacture of   processes for the
were patented by
in the united states and
in england in the 1840s  the first synthetic dye was discovered by
in   he partly transformed
into a crude mixture which  when extracted with alcohol  produced a substance with an intense purple colour  he also developed the first synthetic perfumes  however  it was german industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes  the three major firms  
and
produced several hundred different dyes  and by 1913  the german industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad  in the united states 
use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from
was a commercial success that helped to promote the country s chemical industry 
the
industry can be traced back to the oil works of
in scotland and
in canada  the first plastic was invented by   an english   in 1856  he patented   a
based on
treated with a variety of solvents  this material  exhibited at the 1862 london international exhibition  anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics  the industrial production of
from vegetable oils was started by
and his brother
in 1885 in
based on a modern chemical process invented by william hough watson that used
and  
by the 1920s  chemical firms consolidated into large  
in germany 
in france and
in britain 
became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in america 
currently chemical production is a high-tech industry  where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost 
products  
polymers and plastics  especially        
and
comprise about 80  of the industrys output worldwide    these materials are often converted to
tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials  chemicals are used to make a wide variety of consumer goods  as well as thousands of inputs to agriculture  manufacturing  construction  and service industries  the chemical industry itself consumes 26 percent of its own output    major industrial customers include rubber and
products    apparel  petroleum refining    and primary metals  chemicals are nearly a  3 trillion global enterprise  and the eu and u s  chemical companies are the world s largest producers   
sales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories  including basic chemicals  about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output   life sciences  30 percent   specialty chemicals  20 to 25 percent  and consumer products  about 10 percent  
basic chemicals   commodity chemicals to polymers and speciality chemicals

oil refinery    slovakia 
basic chemicals  or  commodity chemicals  are a broad chemical category including polymers  bulk petrochemicals and intermediates  other derivatives and basic industrials    and   typical growth rates for basic chemicals are about 0.5 to 0.7 times gdp    product prices are generally less than fifty cents per pound   
polymers  the largest revenue segment at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value  includes all categories of
and man-made fibers    the major markets for plastics are   followed by home construction  containers  appliances  pipe  transportation  toys  and games 
the largest-volume polymer product 
 pe   is used mainly in packaging films and other markets such as milk bottles  containers  and pipe 
 pvc   another large-volume product  is principally used to make pipe for construction markets as well as siding and  to a much smaller extent  transportation and packaging materials 
 pp   similar in volume to pvc  is used in markets ranging from packaging  appliances  and containers to clothing and carpeting 
 ps   another large-volume plastic  is used principally for appliances and packaging as well as toys and recreation 
the leading
include     polypropylene  and   with applications including apparel  home furnishings  and other industrial and consumer use 
the principal raw materials for polymers are bulk petrochemicals   
chemicals in the bulk
and intermediates are primarily made from
 lpg     and   their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicals    typical large-volume products include            
 vcm       and   these basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many
and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made for use in the
category  see below  
other derivatives and basic industrials include    
and           and rubber products and contribute about 20 percent of the basic chemicals  external sales 
 about 12 percent of the revenue output  make up the oldest of the chemical categories  products include         acids  such as     and      and  
are the smallest category  about 6 percent  and include     and
chemicals 
life sciences  
life sciences  about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business  include differentiated chemical and biological substances    diagnostics      and   while much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors  their products tend to have very high pricesover ten dollars per poundgrowth rates of 1.5 to 6 times gdp  and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales  life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the food and drug administration  pesticides  also called  crop protection chemicals   are about 10 percent of this category and include     and    
specialty chemicals  
are a category of relatively high valued  rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets  typical growth rates are one to three times gdp with prices over a dollar per pound  they are generally characterized by their innovative aspects  products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain  products include electronic chemicals    adhesives and sealants as well as coatings  industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals  and catalysts  in 2012  excluding fine chemicals  the  546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33  paints  coating and surface treatments  27  advanced polymer  14  adhesives and sealants  13  additives and 13  pigments and inks 
are sold as effect or performance chemicals  sometimes they are mixtures of formulations  unlike     which are almost always single-molecule products 
consumer products  
consumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as     and   typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times gdp 
consumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives  such as in plastics  cleaning materials  cosmetics  paints   coatings  electronic gadgets  automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes  these speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as     electronic chemicals    construction chemicals  industrial cleaners 
and   speciality coatings  printing inks  water-soluble polymers      oil field chemicals  plastic adhesives 
and         textile chemicals  chemical companies rarely supply these products directly to the consumer

technology  
this is a process diagram of a turbine generator  engineers working to produce a sustainable process for use in the chemical industry need to know how to design a sustainable process in which the system can withstand or manipulate process-halting conditions such as heat  friction  pressure  emissions  and contaminants 
from the perspective of chemical engineers  the chemical industry involves the use of
such as
and
methods to produce a wide variety of solid  liquid  and gaseous materials  most of these products serve to
other items  although a smaller number go directly to consumers          and
provide a few examples of product used by consumers 
the industry includes manufacturers of - and -industrial chemicals  ceramic products  petrochemicals  agrochemicals  polymers and rubber  elastomers   oleochemicals  oils  fats  and waxes   explosives  fragrances and flavors  examples of these products are shown in the table below

although the
industry is often considered   a chemical industry   it has many different characteristics that puts it in a separate category  other closely related industries include             and
manufacturers 
chemical processes such as chemical reactions operate in
to form new substances in various types of reaction vessels  in many cases the reactions take place in special corrosion-resistant equipment at elevated temperatures and pressures with the use of   the products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including
especially             and  
the processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site
to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required   more organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and
standards  the products are packaged and delivered by many methods  including pipelines  tank-cars  and tank-trucks  for both solids and liquids   cylinders  drums  bottles  and boxes  chemical companies often have a
laboratory for developing and testing products and processes  these facilities may include pilot plants  and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plant s  
world chemical production  
distillation columns
the scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume   and    to   and the smallest   
the petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants  not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location  but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material  energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale 
those chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world  for example in
and
along the
of the   on
in the
in the   and in
in the   the large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as     road and rail terminals  to demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above  some 50  of the united kingdom s petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the
on  
specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes  these manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks 
continents and countries  
in the u s  there are 170 major chemical companies    they operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the u s  and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating  the u s  chemical output is  750 billion a year  the u s  industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the united states alone  the chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over  5 billion annually on pollution abatement 
in europe the chemical  plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectors    together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies  since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 2/3 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the eu 
in 2012 the chemical sector accounted for 12  of the eu manufacturing industry s added value  europe remains worlds biggest chemical trading region with 43  of the worlds exports and 37 of the worlds imports  although the latest data shows that asia is catching up with 34  of the exports and 37  of imports  even so  europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except japan and china where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance  europes trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion euros 
over the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the european chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion euros to 539 billion euros a picture of constant growth  despite this the european industrys share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36  to 20   this has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like india and china  the data suggest that 95  of this impact is from china alone  in 2012 the data from the european chemical industry council  cefic shows that 5 european countries account for 71  of the eu s chemicals sales  these are germany  france  united kingdom  italy and the netherlands 
the chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years    the fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic
used as  
and   historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world  western europe  north america and japan  the triad   the european community remains the largest producer area followed by the us and japan 
the traditional dominance of chemical production by the triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price  labour cost  energy cost  differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures  instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in china  india  korea  the middle east  south east asia  nigeria  and brazil 
just as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry  we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank  with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export  though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope  the bulk of the worlds  3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations  the united states alone produced  689 billion  18.6 percent of the total world chemical output in 2008
