industrial gases are
materials that are
for use in   the principal gases provided are          
and   although a huge variety of gases and mixtures are available in gas cylinders  the industry producing these gases is known as the industrial gases industry  which is seen as also encompassing the supply of equipment and technology to produce and use the gases  their production is a part of the wider
 where industrial gases are often seen as     
industrial gases are used in a wide range of industries  which include                              
and   industrial gas is sold to other industrial enterprises  typically comprising large orders to
industrial clients  covering a size range from building a process facility or pipeline down to cylinder gas supply 
some
scale business is done  typically through tied
who are supplied   this business covers the
or
of gas cylinders and associated equipment to
and occasionally the general public  this includes products such as
  dispensing gases for   welding gases and welding equipment  lpg and  
sales of small scale gas supply are not confined to just the industrial gas companies or their agents  a wide variety of hand-carried small gas containers  which may be called cylinders  bottles  cartridges  capsules or canisters are available to supply lpg  butane  propane  carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide  examples are

early history of gases  
a   circa 1922
the first gas from the
used by man was almost certainly
when it was discovered that blowing on or fanning a
made it burn brighter  man also used the

food 
from boiling water has also been used by man in
foods 
has been known from ancient times as the byproduct of   particularly for   which was first documented dating from 70006600 bce in    
was used by the chinese in about 500 b c  when they discovered the potential to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil sea water 
was used by the romans in winemaking when it was discovered that burning candles made of sulfur inside empty wine vessels would keep them fresh and prevent them gaining a vinegar smell

early understanding consisted of
and the
of   however with the advent of
and the
of   these gases became positively identified and understood  the
tells us that a number of gases were identified and either discovered or first made in relatively pure form during the
of the 18th and 19th centuries by notable
in their   the timeline of attributed discovery for various gases are carbon dioxide  1754   hydrogen  1766   nitrogen  1772   nitrous oxide  1772 
  oxygen  1773 
  ammonia  1774   chlorine  1774   methane  1776   hydrogen sulfide  1777   carbon monoxide  1800   hydrogen chloride  1810   acetylene  1836   helium  1868 
fluorine  1886   argon  1894   krypton  neon and xenon  1898 
and radon  1899  
carbon dioxide  hydrogen  nitrous oxide  oxygen  ammonia  chlorine  sulfur dioxide and
were already being used during the 19th century  and mainly had uses in       and for
and   for example 
was being made from 1772 and commercially from 1783  chlorine was first used to bleach textiles in 1785
and
was first used for dentistry anaethesia in 1844  at this time gases were often generated for immediate use by   a notable example of a generator is
which was invented in 1844
and could be used to generate gases such as hydrogen    chlorine  acetylene and carbon dioxide by simple   acetylene was manufactured commercially from 1893 and acetylene generators were used from about 1898 to produce gas for
and   however electricity took over as more practical for lighting and once lpg was produced commercially from 1912  the use of acetylene for cooking declined 
once gases had been discovered and produced in modest quantities  the process of
spurred on
and
of
to produce larger quantities of these gases  notable developments in the industrial production of gases include the
to produce hydrogen  in 1869  and oxygen  from 1888   the
for oxygen production which was invented in the 1884  the
to produce chlorine in 1892 and the
to produce ammonia in 1908 
the development of uses in refrigeration also enabled advances in
and the liquefaction of gases  carbon dioxide was first liquefied in 1823  the first
cycle using ether was invented in 1834 and a similar cycle using
was invented in 1873 and another with sulfur dioxide in 1876 
and
were both first made in 1883 
was first made in 1898 and
in 1908 
was first made in 1910  a patent for
was filed in 1914 with the first commercial production in 1917 
although no one event marks the beginning of the industrial gas industry  many would take it to be the 1880s with the construction of the first high pressure   initially cylinders were mostly used for carbon dioxide in
or dispensing of beverages  in 1895 refrigeration compression cycles were further developed to enable   most notably by
allowing larger quantities of oxygen production and in 1896 the discovery that large quantities of acetylene could be dissolved in
and rendered nonexplosive allowed the safe bottling of acetylene 
a particularly important use was the development of
and metal cutting done with oxygen and acetylene from the early 1900s  as production processes for other gases were developed many more gases came to be sold in cylinders without the need for a

libraries in all fields of their business  but particularly in cryogenics

in addition to the major gases produced by air separation and syngas reforming  the industry provides many other gases  some gases are simply byproducts from other industries and others are sometimes bought from other larger chemical producers  refined and repackaged  although a few have their own production processes  examples are hydrogen chloride produced by burning hydrogen in chlorine  nitrous oxide produced by

related services and technology can be supplied such as   which is often provided in hospital gas systems 
  or   another unusual system is the   some industrial gas companies may also supply related   particularly liquids such as

gas distribution  
mode of gas supply  
tube trailer
most materials that are gaseous at ambient temperature and pressure are supplied as compressed gas  a
is used to compress the gas into storage
 such as   gas cylinders or   through
systems  gas cylinders are by far the most common gas storage
and large numbers are produced at a  cylinder fill  facility 
however a few gases are
that can be liquefied at
under
alone  so they can also be supplied as a liquid in an appropriate container  this
also makes these gases useful as ambient
and the most significant industrial gases with this property are
 r717  
 r290  
 r600   and
 r764   chlorine also has this property but is too toxic  corrosive and reactive to ever have been used as a refrigerant  some other gases exhibit this phase change if the ambient temperature is low enough  this includes
 r1150  
 r744  
 r170  
 r744a   and   however  these can only be liquefied under pressure if kept below their
which are 9c for c2h4  31c for co2  32c for c2h6  36c for n2o  45c for sf6 
all of these substances are also be provided as a gas  not a vapor  at the 200
pressure in a gas cylinder because that pressure is above their   other gases can only be supplied as liquid if also cooled  all gases can potentially be used as a refrigerant around the temperatures at which they are liquid  for example nitrogen  r728  and methane  r50  are used as refrigerant at cryogenic temperatures 
exceptionally
can be produced as a cold
known as   which
as it warms in ambient conditions  the properties of carbon dioxide are such that it cannot be liquid at a pressure below its
of 5.1 bar 
acetylene is also supplied differently  since it is so unstable and explosive  this is supplied as a gas dissolved in acetone within a
in a cylinder  acetylene is also the only other common industrial gas that sublimes at atmospheric pressure 
gas delivery  
photos gas cabinet inventory
the major industrial gases can be produced in bulk and delivered to customers by   but can also be packaged and transported 
most gases are sold in
and some sold as liquid in appropriate containers  e g    or as
delivered by truck  the industry originally supplied gases in cylinders to avoid the need for local gas generation  but for large customers such as
or   a large gas production plant may be built nearby  typically called an  on-site  facility  to avoid using large numbers of cylinders   alternatively  an industrial gas company may supply the
to produce the gas rather than the gas itself  an industrial gas company may also offer to act as
under an
contract for a gases facility for a customer  since it usually has the experience of running such facilities for the production or handling of gases for itself 
some materials are dangerous to use as a gas  for example  fluorine is highly reactive and industrial chemistry requiring fluorine often uses
 or   instead  another approach to overcoming gas reactivity is to generate the gas as and when required  which is done  for example  with  
the delivery options are therefore local gas generation    bulk transport         and
in gas cylinders or other containers 
bulk liquid gases are often transferred to end user   gas cylinders  and liquid gas containing vessels  are often used by end users for their own small scale distribution systems  toxic or flammable gas cylinders are often stored by end users in
for protection from external fire or from any leak 
what defines an industrial gas  
industrial gas is a group of materials that are specifically manufactured for use in
and are also gaseous at ambient temperature and pressure  they are
which can be an
or a
that is either
or   and tend to be low
molecules  they could also be a
of individual gases  they have value as a chemical  whether as a   in process enhancement  as a useful end product  or for a particular use  as opposed to having value as a  simple   
the term industrial gases
is sometimes narrowly defined as just the major gases sold  which are  nitrogen  oxygen  carbon dioxide  argon  hydrogen  acetylene and helium  many names are given to gases outside of this main list by the different industrial gas companies  but generally the gases fall into the categories  specialty gases      or   however gases can also be known by their uses or industries that they serve  hence  welding gases  or     etc   or by their source  as in  air gases   or by their mode of supply as in  packaged gases   the major gases might also be termed  bulk gases  or  tonnage gases  
in principle any gas or gas mixture sold by the  industrial gases industry  probably has some industrial use and might be termed an  industrial gas   in practice   industrial gases  are likely to be a pure compound or a mixture of precise   packaged or in small quantities  but with high
or tailored to a specific use  e g     lists of the more significant gases are listed in  the gases  below 
there are cases when a gas is not usually termed an  industrial gas   principally where the gas is processed for later use of its
rather than manufactured for use as a chemical substance or preparation 
the
industry is seen as distinct  so  whilst it is true that natural gas is a  gas  used in  industry  - often as a fuel  sometimes as a feedstock  and in this generic sense is an  industrial gas   this term is not generally used by industrial enterprises for
produced by the
directly from
or in an   materials such as lpg and lng are complex mixtures often without precise chemical composition that often also changes whilst stored 
the
industry is also seen as distinct  so petrochemicals  chemicals derived from   such as
are also generally not described as  industrial gases  
sometimes the chemical industry is thought of as distinct from industrial gases  so materials such as ammonia and chlorine might be considered     especially if supplied as a liquid  instead of or sometimes as well as  industrial gases  
small scale gas supply of hand-carried containers is sometimes not considered to be industrial gas as the use is considered personal rather than industrial  and suppliers are not always gas specialists 
these demarcations are based on perceived boundaries of these industries  although in practice there is some overlap   and an exact scientific definition is difficult  to illustrate  overlap  between industries 
manufactured
 such as   would historically have been considered an industrial gas 
is often considered to be a petrochemical  although its production is a core industrial gases technology  similarly  projects harnessing
or  
schemes  as well as hydrogen production all exhibit overlapping technologies 
helium is an industrial gas  even though its source is from natural gas processing 
any gas is likely to be considered an industrial gas if it is put in a gas cylinder  except perhaps if it is used as a fuel 
propane would be considered an industrial gas when used as a refrigerant  but not when used as a refrigerant in lng production  even though this is an overlapping technology

elemental gases  
elemental gases in the periodic table
the known
which are  or can be obtained from
and which are gaseous are hydrogen  nitrogen  oxygen  fluorine  chlorine  plus the noble gases  and are collectively referred to by chemists as the  elemental gases   these elements are all

fluorine  f2  and chlorine  cl2   the

in the industrial gases industry the term  elemental gases   or sometimes less accurately  molecular gases   is used to distinguish these gases from molecules that are also   these elements are all  
radon is chemically stable  but it is

of 3.8 days  its uses are due to its radioactivity rather than its chemistry and it requires specialist handling outside of industrial gas industry norms  it can however be produced as a by-product of
processing  radon is a trace
