sanger  andrew  2011   m n  schmitt  louise arimatsu  tim mccormack  eds    yearbook of international humanitarian law 2010  springer science   business media  13  429       israel claims it no longer occupies the gaza strip  maintaining that it is neither a stale nor a territory occupied or controlled by israel  but rather it has  sui generis  status  pursuant to the disengagement plan  israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in gaza and there is no longer a permanent israeli military or civilian presence in the territory  however the plan also provided that israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the gaza strip  will continue to maintain exclusive authority in gaza air space  and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the gaza strip as well as maintaining an israeli military presence on the egyptian-gaza border  and reserving the right to reenter gaza at will 
israel continues to control six of gaza s seven land crossings  its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory  egypt controls one of gaza s land crossings  troops from the israeli defence force regularly enter pans of the territory and or deploy missile attacks  drones and sonic bombs into gaza  israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into gaza  if gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight  gaza is also dependent on israel for inter alia electricity  currency  telephone networks  issuing ids  and permits to enter and leave the territory  israel also has sole control of the palestinian population registry through which the israeli army regulates who is classified as a palestinian and who is a gazan or west banker  since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions israel has refused to add people to the palestinian population registry 
it is this direct external control over gaza and indirect control over life within gaza that has led the united nations  the un general assembly  the un fact finding mission to gaza  international human rights organisations  us government websites  the uk foreign and commonwealth office and a significant number of legal commentators  to reject the argument that gaza is no longer occupied  cs1 maint  uses editors parameter   
 
 2012   elizabeth wilmshurst  ed    oxford university press  p 295    even after the accession to power of hamas  israel s claim that it no longer occupies gaza has not been accepted by un bodies  most states  nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the rafah crossing until at least may 2011  its control of gaza s maritime zones and airspace which constitute what aronson terms the  security envelope  around gaza  as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in gaza 
  gawerc  michelle  2012     lexington books  p 44    while israel withdrew from the immediate territory  israel still controlled all access to and from gaza through the border crossings  as well as through the coastline and the airspace  ln addition  gaza was dependent upon israel for water electricity sewage communication networks and for its trade  gisha 2007  dowty 2008   ln other words  while israel maintained that its occupation of gaza ended with its unilateral disengagement palestinians  as well as many human right organizations and international bodies  argued that gaza was by all intents and purposes still occupied

  alexandrowicz  ra anan  24 january 2012     the new york times  israel is the only modern state that has held territories under military occupation for over four decades
  weill  sharon  2014     oxford university press  p 22    although the basic philosophy behind the law of military occupation is that it is a temporary situation modem occupations have well demonstrated that rien ne dure comme le provisoire a significant number of post-1945 occupations have lasted more than two decades such as the occupations of namibia by south africa and of east timor by indonesia as well as the ongoing occupations of northern cyprus by turkey and of western sahara by morocco  the israeli occupation of the palestinian territories  which is the longest in all occupation s history has already entered its fifth decade

charbit  denis  2014    israel s self-restrained secularism from the 1947 status quo letter to the present   in berlinerblau  jacques  fainberg  sarah  nou  aurora    new york  palgrave macmillan  pp 167169    the compromise  therefore  was to choose constructive ambiguity  as surprising as it may seem  there is no law that declares judaism the official religion of israel  however  there is no other law that declares israel s neutrality toward all confessions  judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state  and even though the jewish  muslim and christian clergy receive their salaries from the state  this fact does not make israel a neutral state  this apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters     it is important to note that from a multicultural point of view  this self-restrained secularism allows muslim law to be practiced in israel for personal matters of the muslim community  as surprising as it seems  if not paradoxical for a state in war  israel is the only western democratic country in which sharia enjoys such an official status
