a biofuel is a
that is produced through contemporary biological processes  such as agriculture and   rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of   such as coal and petroleum  from prehistoric biological matter  biofuels can be derived directly from plants  or indirectly from agricultural  commercial  domestic  and or industrial wastes  renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary   such as those that occur in
or
through the process of   other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of
 referring to recently living organisms  most often referring to
or plant-derived materials   this biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways  thermal conversion  chemical conversion  and biochemical conversion  this biomass conversion can result in fuel in     or
form  this new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels 
bioethanol is an

or
crops such as     or     derived from non-food sources  such as trees and grasses  is also being developed as a
for ethanol production  ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form  but it is usually used as a
to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions  bioethanol is widely used in the
and in   current plant design does not provide for converting the
portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation 
can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form  but it is usually used as a
additive to reduce levels of particulates    and
from diesel-powered vehicles  biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using
and is the most common biofuel in europe 
in 2010  worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters  28 billion gallons us   up 17  from 2009  and biofuels provided 2.7  of the world s fuels for road transport  global
production reached 86 billion liters  23 billion gallons us  in 2010  with the united states and brazil as the world s top producers  accounting together for 90  of global production  the world s largest biodiesel producer is the   accounting for 53  of all biodiesel production in 2010  as of 2011  mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces  the
has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal  the production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry  where by 2010  79  of all cars produced in brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of bioethanol and gasoline

most transportation fuels are liquids  because vehicles usually require high   this occurs naturally in liquids and solids  high energy density can also be provided by an   these engines require clean-burning fuels  the fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases  thus  liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning  in addition  liquids  and gases  can be pumped  which means handling is easily mechanized  and thus less laborious

and   are produced by the action of
and
through the fermentation of sugars or starches  easiest   or cellulose  which is more difficult  
 also called biogasoline  is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline  because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine

is the most common biofuel worldwide  particularly  
are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from        
and any sugar or starch from which
such as   can be made  such as
and
waste  etc    the ethanol production methods used are
 to release sugars from stored starches   fermentation of the sugars 
and drying  the distillation process requires significant energy input for heat  sometimes unsustainable
fossil fuel  but cellulosic biomass such as   the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice  is the most common fuel in brazil  while pellets  wood chips and also waste heat are more common in europe  - where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid 
ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline  it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage  most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15  bioethanol with petroleum gasoline  ethanol has a smaller
than that of gasoline  this means it takes more fuel  volume and mass  to produce the same amount of work  an advantage of ethanol  ch
3ch
2oh  is that it has a higher
than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations  which allows an increase of an engine s
for increased   in high-altitude  thin air  locations  some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter
to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions 
ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol   as they do not require a chimney and are  flueless   bioethanol fires are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue  the downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires  and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning 
corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of   according to a joint research agenda conducted through the us department of energy  the fossil energy ratios    for cellulosic ethanol  corn ethanol  and gasoline are 10.3  1.36  and 0.81  respectively 
ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline  this is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol  in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km  the best project found ffv vehicles to be 1-26  more energy efficient than petrol cars    but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30   so more fuel stops are required 
with current subsidies  ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the united states 
biodiesel  
main articles 
and
is the most common biofuel in europe  it is produced from oils or fats using
and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil mineral diesel  chemically  it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl  or ethyl  esters     feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats  vegetable oils                     
and   pure biodiesel  b100  currently reduces emissions with up to 60  compared to diesel  
biodiesel can be used in any
when mixed with mineral diesel  in some countries  manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for b100 use  although
of   for example  asks drivers to check by telephone with the vw environmental services department before switching to b100  b100 may become more
at lower temperatures  depending on the feedstock used  in most cases  biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards  which use     by   synthetic rubber in their mechanical
systems  note however  that no vehicles are certified for using neat biodiesel before 2014  as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date 
electronically controlled    and    type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel  these engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel  many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on b100 without altering the engine itself  although this depends on the
design  since biodiesel is an effective
and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel 
may need to be replaced more often  as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes  it also effectively cleans the engine
of carbon deposits  helping to maintain efficiency  in many european countries  a 5  biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations  biodiesel is also an   meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel  this improves the
of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon  however  using neat biodiesel may increase nox-emissions   possibly the new emission standards euro vi epa 10 will lead to reduced nox-levels also when using b100 
biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and   and has a high
of about 300f  148c  compared to petroleum diesel fuel  which has a flash point of 125f  52c  
in the usa  more than 80  of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel  the emerging us biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200  from 2004 to 2005   by the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold  from 2004  to more than  1billion us gallons  3,800,000m3  
in france  biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8  in the fuel used by all french diesel vehicles

researchers engineered a new metabolic pathway to bypass
and increase the rate of conversion of sugars into biofuel  while
researchers developed a strain capable of producing short-chain alkanes  free fatty acids  fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl  acyl carrier protein  acp   to fatty acid to fatty acyl-coa pathway in vivo  it is believed that in the future it will be possible to  tweak  the genes to make gasoline from straw or animal manure

main article 
straight unmodified
vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel  but lower-quality oil can and has been used for this purpose  used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel  or  more rarely  cleaned of water and particulates and used as a fuel 
as with 100  biodiesel  b100   to ensure the
atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion 
must be heated to reduce its
to that of diesel  either by electric coils or heat exchangers  this is easier in warm or temperate climates      and   as well as a number of smaller companies  such as   offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil  without the need for after-market modifications 
vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use
or
electronic diesel injection systems  due to the design of the combustion chambers in
engines  these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil  this system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn  some older engines  especially mercedes  are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion  a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre- pumpe duse 
engines and other similar engines with   several companies  such as
or wolf  have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades 
oils and fats can be
to give a diesel substitute  the resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high   low in
and
and does not contain oxygen 
can be blended with diesel in all proportions  they have several advantages over biodiesel  including good performance at low temperatures  no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack 
bioethers  
bio  also referred to as fuel ethers or   are cost-effective
that act as
enhancers  bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins  such as iso-butylene  with bioethanol   bioethers are created by wheat or sugar beet  they also enhance
performance  whilst significantly reducing engine wear and
  though bioethers are likely to replace petroethers in the uk  it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density  greatly reducing the amount of ground-level   they contribute to air quality 
when it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives

ter-amyl ethyl ether  taee 
the european fuel oxygenates association  efoa  credits methyl tertiary-butyl ether  mtbe  and ethyl ter-butyl ether  etbe  as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead  ethers were brought into fuels in europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound  although europeans still use bio-ether additives  the us no longer has an oxygenate requirement therefore bio-ethers are no longer used as the main fuel additive 
biogas

by   it can be produced either from
materials or by the use of
fed into
to supplement gas yields  the solid byproduct    can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer 
biogas can be recovered from
waste processing systems 
note    a less clean form of biogas  is produced in
through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion  if it escapes into the atmosphere  it is a potential  
farmers can produce biogas from
from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters 
syngas  
main article 
  a mixture of  
and other hydrocarbons  is produced by partial combustion of biomass  that is  combustion with an amount of
that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water  before partial combustion  the biomass is dried  and sometimes   the resulting gas mixture  syngas  is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel  more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted 
syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines 
or high-temperature fuel cells  the   a wood-fueled gasification reactor  can be connected to an internal combustion engine 
syngas can be used to produce  
and   or converted via the
to produce a diesel substitute  or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline  gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700c 
lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing   but results in syngas polluted with  
solid biofuels  
examples include    
trimmings        nonfood   and  
when raw biomass is already in a suitable form  such as    it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam  when raw biomass is in an inconvenient form  such as sawdust  wood chips  grass  urban waste wood  agricultural residues   the typical process is to densify the biomass  this process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size  known as hogfuel   which  depending on the densification type  can be from 1 to 3cm  0.4 to 1.2in   which is then concentrated into a fuel product  the current processes produce   cubes  or pucks  the pellet process is most common in europe  and is typically a pure wood product  the other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet  and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks  the resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems  such as boilers 
industry has used sawdust  bark and chips for fuel for decades  primary in the pulp and paper industry  and also bagasse  spent sugar cane  fueled boilers in the sugar cane industry  boilers in the range of 500,000lb hr of steam  and larger  are in routine operation  using grate  spreader stoker  suspension burning and fluid bed combustion  utilities generate power  typically in the range of 5 to 50 mw  using locally available fuel  other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low cost fuel 
one of the advantages of biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct  residue or waste-product of other processes  such as farming  animal husbandry and forestry  in theory  this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources  although this is not always the case 
a problem with the combustion of raw biomass is that it emits considerable amounts of   such as
and   even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers  pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets  producing much larger emissions of
and  
in spite of the above noted study  numerous studies have shown biomass fuels have significantly less impact on the environment than fossil based fuels  of note is the us department of energy laboratory  operated by midwest research institute biomass power and conventional fossil systems with and without co2 sequestration  comparing the  
emissions and economics study  power generation emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases  ghgs   mainly
 co2  
co2 from the power plant
can significantly reduce the ghgs from the power plant itself  but this is not the total picture  co2 capture and sequestration consumes additional energy  thus lowering the plant s   to compensate for this  more fossil fuel must be procured and consumed to make up for lost capacity 
taking this into consideration  the
 gwp   which is a combination of co2  methane  ch4   and
 n2o  emissions  and energy balance of the system need to be examined using a   this takes into account the upstream processes which remain constant after co2 sequestration  as well as the steps required for additional power generation  firing biomass instead of coal led to a 148  reduction in gwp     
a derivative of solid biofuel is   which is produced by biomass   biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal  as wood stock becomes scarce  this alternative is gaining ground  in eastern   for example

second-generation  advanced  biofuels  
main article 
second generation biofuels  also known as advanced biofuels  are fuels that can be manufactured from various types of   biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the   biomass is derived from plant materials but can also include animal materials 
first generation biofuels are made from the
and
found in arable crops  which can be easily extracted using conventional technology  in comparison  second generation biofuels are made from
or woody crops  agricultural residues or waste  which makes it harder to extract the required fuel  a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation 
sustainable biofuels

biofuels in the form of
derived from plant materials are entering the market  driven mainly by the perception that they reduce climate gas emissions  and also by factors such as
and the need for increased   however  many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the     and   in 2008  the nobel-prize winning chemist
published findings that the release of
 n2o  emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace 
the challenge is to support biofuel development  including the development of new   with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is   responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in africa  latin america and asia 
according to the   sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production  nor cause water or environmental problems  and would enhance soil fertility  the selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions  a key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland

biofuels currently make up 3.1  of the total road transport fuel in the uk or 1,440 million litres  by 2020  10  of the energy used in uk road and rail transport must come from renewable sources  this is the equivalent of replacing 4.3 million tonnes of fossil oil each year  conventional biofuels are likely to produce between 3.7 and 6.6  of the energy needed in road and rail transport  while
could meet up to 4.3  of the uks renewable transport fuel target by 2020

another issue with biofuel use and production is the us has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected  the renewable fuel standard  rfs  set by congress for 2010 was pushed back to at best 2012 to produce 100 million gallons of pure ethanol  not blended with a fossil fuel  
current research  
research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops  using the current yields  vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage  it would require twice the land area of the us to be devoted to soybean production  or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production  to meet current us heating and transportation needs   
specially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields and are very useful in

fungi  
a group at the
in   in a 2008 paper  stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner  more research on this fungal species 
  and others  is likely to appear in the near future  the recent discovery of a variant of the fungus
 later renamed ascocoryne sarcoides  points toward the production of so-called
from cellulose  this organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern   and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel  many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms  suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio-production of fuels in the future  reviewed in

from bamboo and other plant materials  there has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood-feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel 
greenhouse gas emissions  
some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions  the payback period  that is  the time it will take biofuels to pay back the carbon debt they acquire due to land-use change  has been estimated to be between 100 and 1000 years  depending on the specific instance and location of land-use change  however  no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion 
a study conducted in the tocantis state  in northern brazil  found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants  the j  curcas  jc group  and the r  communis  rc group   this region is composed of 15  amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity  and 80  cerrado forest with lower biodiversity  during the study  the farmers that planted the jc group released over 2193 mg co2  while losing 53-105 mg co2 sequestration from deforestation  and the rc group farmers released 562 mg co2  while losing 48-90 mg co2 to be sequestered from forest depletion  the production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide  but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting  this has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves  in addition  the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation  as well as of fertilizers  herbicides and pesticides  this does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff  but also to the emission of nitrous oxide  no2  as a fertilizer byproduct  which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide  co2  
converting rainforests  peatlands  savannas  or grasslands to produce food cropbased biofuels in brazil  southeast asia  and the united states creates a biofuel carbon debt by releasing 17 to 420 times more co2 than the annual greenhouse gas  ghg  reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels  biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt 
water use  
in addition to water required to grow crops  biofuel facilities require significant process water
