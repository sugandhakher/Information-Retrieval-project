ethical consumerism  alternatively called ethical consumption  ethical purchasing  moral purchasing  ethical sourcing  ethical shopping or green consumerism  is a type of
that is based on the concept of   it is practiced through  positive buying  in that ethical products are favoured  or  moral    that is negative purchasing and company-based purchasing 
the term  ethical consumer   now used generically  was first popularised by the uk magazine   first published in 1989  ethical consumer magazine s key innovation was to produce  ratings tables   inspired by the criteria-based approach of the then emerging
movement  ethical consumer s ratings tables awarded companies negative marks  and from 2005 overall scores  across a range of ethical and environmental categories such as  animal rights    human rights  and  pollution and toxics   empowering consumers to make ethically informed consumption choices and providing campaigners with reliable information on corporate behaviour  such criteria-based ethical and environmental ratings have subsequently become commonplace both in providing consumer information and in business-to-business
and
ratings such as those provided by innovest    domini  irrc 
and kld analytics  today 
and
provide  environmental  social and governance  ratings direct to the financial data screens of hundreds of thousands of stock market traders  the not-for-profit ethical consumer research association continues to publish ethical consumer and its associated website  which provides free access to ethical ratings tables

argues that no purchasing decision exists that does not itself imply some moral choice  and that there is no purchasing that is not ultimately moral in nature  this mirrors older arguments  especially by the   e g      that one must accept all personal moral and spiritual liability of all harms done at any distance in space or time to anyone by one s own choices  it is often suggested that
scriptures further direct followers towards practising good stewardship of the earth  under an obligation to a god who is believed to have created the planet for us to share with other creatures  a similar argument presented from a
point of view is that it is simply better for human beings to acknowledge that the planet supports
only because of a delicate balance of many different factors

some trust criteria  e g 
or   are considered to be part of any purchasing or sourcing decision  however  these terms refer to broader systems of guidance that would  ideally  cause any purchasing decision to disqualify offered products or services based on non-price criteria that affect the moral rather than the functional liabilities of the entire production process    a proponent of   refers to  comprehensive outcomes  of production services as opposed to the  culminative outcomes  of using the product of such services    often  moral criteria are part of a much broader shift away from
towards a deeper
where all activities  from growing to harvesting to processing to delivery  are considered part of the
and for which consumers are  responsible  
andrew wilson  director of the uk s ashridge centre for business and society  argues that  shopping is more important than voting   and that the disposition of
is the most basic role we play in any system of   some theorists believe that it is the clearest way that we express our actual moral choices  i e   if we say we care about something but continue to buy from parties that have a high probability of risk of harm or destruction of that thing  we don t really care about it  we are practicing a form of simple

growing diverse use of the term  
as large corporations have tried to position themselves as moral  principled or ethical organisations  the definition has become wider and means different things to different groups of people  for example

blog  ethical consumerism can be seen as a movement in   which may or may not reflect actual changes in the practices of businesses  particular areas of interest for large businesses are environmental impact and the treatment of workers at the bottom of the organisational hierarchy  this change reflects an increasing awareness of ethical issues and
amongst mainstream  
standards and labels  
a number of standards  labels and marks have been introduced for ethical consumers  such as the following 
for electricity agreements
best buy label

sustainably sourced wood
seal of approval
 religious standard

sustainably sourced seafood
no pork no lard  semi-religious standard 
along with disclosure of ingredients  some
of origins of clothing or food is required in all   this practice has been extended in some   e g   where every item carries the name  phone number and fax number of the factory where it was made so a buyer can inspect its conditions  and  more importantly  to prove that the item was not made by     use of which to produce export goods is banned in most developed nations  such labels have also been used for boycotts  as when the merchandise mark
was introduced in 1887 
these labels serve as tokens of some reliable validation process  some   much as does a brand name or a nation s flag  they also signal some   or trust  in some community of auditors that must follow those instructions to validate those labels 
some companies in the united states  though currently not required to reduce their   are doing so voluntarily by changing their energy use practices  as well as by directly funding  through    businesses that are already sustainableor are developing or improving

over time  some   theorists suggest  the amount of
or trust invested in nation-states  or  flags   will continue to decrease  and that placed in corporations  or  brands   will increase  this can only be offset by retrenched
to reinforce shared national standards in
laws  and by placing the trust in civil society in such  moral labels   these arguments have been a major focus of the   which includes many broader arguments against the amoral nature of markets as such  however  the economic school of
pioneered by
has offered counter-arguments based on economic demonstration to this theory of  amoral markets  versus  moral governments

conscientious consumption  
the consumer rationalizes unnecessary and even unwanted consumption by saying that  it s for a good cause   as a result  the consumer buys
during  
to support the environment  candy and popcorn from school children  greeting cards and gift wrap from charities  and many other  often unwanted objects  the consumer avoids considering whether the price offered is fair  whether a small cash donation would be more effective with far less work  or even whether selling the item is consistent with the ostensible mission  such as when sports teams sell candy 
some of these efforts are based on   the consumer is buying an association with women s health or environmental concerns as much as she or he is buying a tangible product 
alternative giving  
main article 
in response to an increasing demand for ethical consumerism surrounding gift giving occasions  charities have promoted an alternative gift market  in which charitable contributions are made on behalf of the gift  recipient   the  recipient  receives a card explaining the selected gift  while the actual gift item  frequently agricultural supplies or domestic animals  is sent to a family in a poor community 
criticism  
critics argue that the ability to affect structural change is limited in ethical consumerism  some cite the preponderance of
as the actual effect of ethical consumerism  while others argue that information is limited regarding the outcomes of a given purchase  preventing consumers from making informed ethical choices    critics have also argued that the uneven distribution of wealth prevents consumerism  ethical or otherwise  from fulfilling its democratic potential 
one study suggests that  buying green  serves as a license for unethical behavior  in their 2009 paper   do green products make us better people    nina mazar  chen-bo zhong state the following 
in line with the halo associated with green consumerism  people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products  however  people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products  together  the studies show that consumption is more tightly connected to our social and ethical behaviors in directions and domains other than previously thought 
in a 2010
article  british environmental writer and activist
argued that green consumers who do not articulate their values are part of  a catastrophic mistake  on the grounds that such consumerism  strengthens extrinsic values   those that  concern status and self-advancement    thereby  making future campaigns less likely to succeed
