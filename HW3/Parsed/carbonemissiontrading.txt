carbon emission trading
carbon emissions trading is a form of
that specifically targets
 calculated in tonnes of
or tco2e  and it currently constitutes the bulk of emissions trading 
this form of permit trading is a common method countries utilize in order to meet their obligations specified by the   namely the reduction of carbon emissions in an attempt to reduce
future  
under carbon trading  a country having more emissions of carbon is able to purchase the right to emit more and the country having less emission trades the right to emit carbon to other countries  more carbon emitting countries  by this way try to keep the limit of carbon emission specified to them 
contents
economics  
emissions trading works by setting a quantitative limit on the emissions produced by emitters  the
basis for emissions trading is linked to the concept of
 goldemberg et al    1996  p 29  
costs and valuation  
the economic problem with
is that the emitters of
 ghgs  do not face the full cost implications of their actions  imf  2008  p 6   there are costs that emitters do face  e g   the costs of the fuel being used  but there are other costs that are not necessarily included in the price of a good or service  these other costs are called
 halsns et al    2007   they are  external  because they are costs that the emitter does not face  external costs may affect the
of others  in the case of climate change  ghg emissions affect the welfare of people living in the future  as well as affecting the natural environment  toth et al   2001   these external costs can be estimated and converted in a common  monetary  unit  the argument for doing this is that these external costs can then be added to the private costs that the emitter faces  in doing this  the emitter faces the full    costs of their actions  imf  2008  p 9  
ethics and fairness  
the way of dealing with climate change has particular ethical issues and other issues related to the fairness of the problem  to actually calculate social costs requires
about the value of future climate impacts  smith et al    2001   there is no consensus among economists over how to value the fairness  economists use the term
to mean fairness  of a particular climate policy  e g   how to share the burden of costs for mitigating future climate change  toth et al   2001   nor do economists have any professional expertise in making ethical decisions  e g   over the value assigned to the welfare of future generations  arrow et al    1996  p 130   typically all the impacts of policy  both the costs and benefits  are added together     with different impacts on different individuals assigned particular  weightings   i e   relative levels of importance  these valuations are decided by the economist doing the study  valuations can be difficult since not all goods have a market price 
there are methods to infer prices for    goods and services  however  these valuations can be controversial  e g   valuations of human health impacts  or
 smith et al    2001   there is also controversy over how potentially positive climate impacts  e g  
in particular regions benefiting from climate change  offset negative impacts in other regions  e g   reduced food production  smith et al    2001   the main advantage of economic analysis in this area is that it allows a comprehensive and consistent treatment of climate change impacts  it also allows the benefits of climate change policy decisions to be compared against other possible environmental policies 
coase  
 referred to by toth et al    2001  and helm  2005  p 4  argued that social costs could be accounted for by negotiating property rights according to a particular objective  coase s model assumes perfectly operating
and equal
among those arguing for property rights  for climate change  the property rights are for emissions  permits or quotas   however  it should be noted that other factors affect the climate other than just emissions  e g   the ocean  forests  etc   goldemberg et al    1996  pp 2829   in coase s model  efficiency  i e   achieving a given reduction in emissions at lowest cost  is promoted by the market system  this can also be looked at from the perspective of having the greatest flexibility to reduce emissions  flexibility is desirable because the
costs  that is to say  the incremental costs of reducing emissions  varies among countries  emissions trading allows emission reductions to be first made in locations where the marginal costs of abatement are lowest  bashmakov et al    2001   over time  efficiency can also be promoted by allowing  banking  of permits  goldemberg et al    1996  p 30   this allows polluters to reduce emissions at a time when it is most efficient to do so 
equity  
one of the advantages of coase s model is that it suggests that fairness  equity  can be addressed in the distribution of property rights  and that regardless of how these property rights are assigned  the market will produce the most efficient outcome  goldemberg et al    1996  p 29   in reality  according to the held view  markets are not perfect  and it is therefore possible that a trade off will occur between equity and efficiency  halsns et al    2007  
taxes versus caps  
a large number of papers in the economics literature suggest that
should be preferred to carbon trading  carbon trust  2009   counter-arguments to this are usually based on the possible preference that politicians may have for emissions trading compared with taxes  bashmakov et al    2001   one of these is that emission permits can be freely distributed to polluting industries  rather than the revenues going to the government  in comparison  industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from a carbon tax  it is therefore argued that with emissions trading  polluters have an incentive to cut emissions  but if they are exempted from a carbon tax  they have no incentive to cut emissions  smith  2008  pp 5657   on the other hand  freely distributing emission permits could potentially lead to corrupt behaviour  world bank  2010  p 268  
a pure carbon tax fixes the price of carbon  but allows the amount of carbon emissions to vary  and a pure carbon cap places a limit on carbon emissions  letting the market price of tradable carbon allowances vary  proponents argue that a carbon tax is more easy and simple to enforce on a broad-base scale than cap-and-trade programs  the simplicity and immediacy of a carbon tax has been proven effective in british columbia  canada - enacted and implemented in five months  taxing can provide the right incentives for polluters  inventors  and engineers to develop cleaner technologies  in addition to creating revenue for the government 
supporters of carbon cap-and-trade systems believe it sets legal limits for emissions reductions  unlike with carbon taxes  with a tax  there can be estimates of reduction in carbon emissions  which may not be sufficient to change the course of climate change  a declining cap gives allowance for firm reduction targets and a system for measuring when targets are met  it also allows for flexibility  unlike rigid taxes  providing emission permits under emissions trading is preferred in situations where more accurate target level of environment certainty is needed 
trading  
in an emissions trading system  permits may be traded by emitters who are liable to hold a sufficient number of permits in system  some analysts argue that allowing others to participate in trading  e g   private
firms  can allow for better
in the system  e g   to variations in permit prices  bashmakov et al    2001   it may also improve the efficiency of system  according to bashmakov et al    2001   regulation of these other entities may be necessary  as is done in other   e g   to prevent abuses of the system  such as  
incentives and allocation  
emissions trading gives polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions  however  there are possible
that can exist in emissions trading  allocating permits on the basis of past emissions   grandfathering   can result in firms having an incentive to maintain emissions  for example  a firm that reduced its emissions would receive fewer permits in the future  imf  2008  pp 2526   this problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds  since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions  goldemberg et al    1996  p 38   on the other hand  a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away  provides the government with revenues  these revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy  e g   by funding reductions in
taxes  fisher et al    1996  p 417  
in coase s model of social costs  either choice  grandfathering or auctioning  leads to efficiency  in reality  grandfathering subsidizes polluters  meaning that polluting industries may be kept in business longer than would otherwise occur    grandfathering may also reduce the rate of technological improvement towards less polluting technologies  fisher et al    1996  p 417  
the economist william nordhaus argues that allocations cost the economy as they cause the under utilisation an efficient form of taxation  nordhaus points out that normal income  goods or service taxes distort efficient investment and consumption  so by using pollution taxes to generate revenue an emissions scheme can increase the efficiency of the economy 
form of allocation
the economist
states that permits allocated to existing emitters by  grandfathering  are not  free   as the permits are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter  the cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy  typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs 
it is important that we stop thinking in terms of payments to australian firms in order to compensate them for the effects of the domestic emissions trading scheme  there is no basis for compensation arising from the loss of profits or asset values as a result of this new policy  the rationale for payments to trade-exposed  emissions-intensive industries is different and sound  it is to avoid the economic and environmental costs of having firms in these industries contracting more than  and failing to expand as much as  they would in a world in which all countries were applying carbon constraints involving similar costs to ours 
units  
the units which may be transferred under article 17   emissions trading  each equal to one metric tonne of emissions  in co2-equivalent terms   may be in the form of 
an
 aau  issued by an annex i party on the basis of its assigned amount
to articles 3.7 and 3.8 of the protocol 
a
 rmu  issued by an annex i party on the basis of land use  land-use change and forestry    activities under articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the kyoto protocol 
an
 eru  generated by a
project under article 6 of the  
a
 cer  generated from a
project activity under article 12 of the kyoto protocol 
transfers and acquisitions of these units are to be tracked and recorded   through the registry systems under the kyoto protocol   
market trend  
carbon emissions trading has been steadily increasing in recent years  according to the world bank s carbon finance unit  374 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent  tco2e  were exchanged through projects in 2005  a 240  increase relative to 2004  110 mtco2e  which was itself a 41  increase relative to 2003  78 mtco2e  
the increasing costs of permits have had the effect of increasing costs of carbon emitting fuels and activities  based on a survey of 12 european countries  it was concluded that an increase in carbon and fuel prices of approximately ten percent would result in a short-run increase in electrical power prices of roughly eight percent  this would suggest that a lowering cap on carbon emissions will likely lead to an increase in the costs of alternative power sources  whereas a sudden lowering of a carbon emission cap may prove detrimental to economies  a gradual lowering of the cap may risk future environmental damage via global warming 
in 2010
 ccx  ceased its trading of carbon emissions  450 members of the ccx had achieved reductions of 700million tonnes of emissions over the life of the cap and trade program  the seven year ccx cap and trade program claimed to have successfully provided cost-effectiveness and market-based flexibility for emissions trading 
business reaction  
economist craig mellow wrote in may 78 2008  the combination of global warming and growing environmental consciousness is creating a potentially huge market in the trading of pollution-emission credits  
with the creation of a market for mandatory trading of carbon dioxide emissions within the kyoto protocol  the
has established itself as the center of the carbon finance market  and is expected to have grown into a market valued at  60 billion in 2007    the voluntary offset market  by comparison  is projected to grow to about  4bn by 2010 
twenty three
came together in the   a business group formed at the january 2005   the group included      
and   on 9 june 2005  the group published a statement stating that there was a need to act on climate change and stressing the importance of market-based solutions  it called on governments to establish  clear  transparent  and consistent price signals  through  creation of a long-term policy framework  that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases  by december 2007  this had grown to encompass 150 global businesses 
business in the uk have come out strongly in support of emissions trading as a key tool to mitigate climate change  supported by green ngos 
voluntary surrender of units  
there are examples of individuals and organisations purchasing tradable emission permits and  retiring   cancelling  them so they cannot be used by emitters to authorise their emissions  this makes the emissions  cap  lower and therefore further reduces emissions  in 1992  the national healthy air license exchange was established to pool donations for buying and retiring sulfur allowances under the usa sulfur allowance trading program 
the british organization  climakind  accepts donations and uses them to buy and cancel european allowances  the carbon credits traded in the   it is argued that this removes the credits from the carbon market so they cannot be used to allow the emission of carbon and that this reduces the  cap  on emissions by reducing the number of credits available to emitters 
the british organisation
promotes cancelling carbon credits in order to lower emissions trading caps  as of august 2010  sandbag states that it has cancelled carbon credits equivalent to 2145 tonnes of co2 
criticisms

critics of carbon trading  such as   argue that it places disproportionate emphasis on individual lifestyles and carbon footprints  distracting attention from the wider  systemic changes and collective political action that needs to be taken to tackle climate change    groups such as
have argued that the market will choose the easiest means to save a given quantity of carbon in the short term  which may be different from the pathway required to obtain sustained and sizable reductions over a longer period  and so a market-led approach is likely to reinforce technological lock-in  for instance  small cuts may often be achieved cheaply through investment in making a technology more efficient  where larger cuts would require scrapping the technology and using a different one  they also argue that emissions trading is undermining alternative approaches to pollution control   with which it does not combine well  and so the overall effect it is having is to actually stall significant change to less polluting technologies  in september 2010  campaigning group
released  trading carbon  how it works and why it is controversial    which compiles many of the arguments against carbon trading 
the
published an article about cap-and-trade systems which argued that  carbon markets create a muddle  and     leave much room for unverifiable manipulation   lohmann  2009  pointed out that emissions trading schemes create new uncertainties and risks    which can be commodified by means of   thereby creating a new
market   
in china some companies started artificial production of greenhouse gases with sole purpose of their recycling and gaining carbon credits  similar practices happened in india  earned credit were then sold to companies in us and europe 
recent proposals for alternative schemes to avoid the problems of cap-and-trade schemes include     which was being actively considered by the irish parliament in may 2008  and the sky trust schemes  these schemes state that cap-and-trade or cap-and-tax   schemes inherently impact the poor and those in rural areas  who have less choice in energy consumption options 
carbon trading has been criticised as a form of   in which rich countries maintain their levels of consumption while getting credit for carbon savings in inefficient industrial projects  nations that have fewer financial resources may find that they cannot afford the permits necessary for developing an industrial infrastructure  thus inhibiting these countries economic development 
the kyoto protocol s
has been criticised for not promoting enough  
another criticism is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the kyoto protocol due to the surplus of allowances that some countries possess  for example  russia had a surplus of allowances due to its economic collapse following the end of the soviet union  other countries could have bought these allowances from russia  but this would not have reduced emissions  rather  it would have been simply be a redistribution of emissions allowances  in practice  kyoto parties have as yet chosen not to buy these surplus allowances 
structuring issues  
corporate and governmental carbon emission trading schemes  a trading system devised by economists to reduce co2 emissions  the goal being to reduce global warming  have been modified in ways that have been attributed to permitting
to take place  the principal point here is that financial system innovations  outside banking  open up the possibility for unregulated  non-banking  transactions to take place in relativity unsupervised markets
