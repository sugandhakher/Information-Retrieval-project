overview  
the photosynthetic reaction can be divided into two
of   both of which are essential to producing   in plant photosynthesis  water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons  the second stage of plant photosynthesis  also known as the   is a
that converts carbon dioxide into
 fuel   researchers of artificial photosynthesis are developing
that are able to perform both of these reactions  furthermore  the protons resulting from water splitting can be used for hydrogen production  these
must be able to react quickly and absorb a large percentage of the incident solar  
natural  left  versus artificial photosynthesis  right 
whereas
can provide energy directly from sunlight  the inefficiency of fuel production from photovoltaic electricity  indirect process  and the fact that sunshine is not constant throughout the day sets a limit to its use  one way of using natural photosynthesis is via the production of a   which is an indirect process that suffers from low energy conversion efficiency  due to photosynthesis  own low efficiency in converting sunlight to biomass   the cost of harvesting and transporting the fuel  and clashes with the increasing need of land mass for food production  artificial photosynthesis aims then to produce a fuel from sunlight that can be conveniently stored and used when sunlight is not available  by using direct processes  that is  to produce a   with the development of catalysts able to reproduce the key steps of photosynthesis  water and sunlight would ultimately be the only needed sources for clean energy production  the only by-product would be oxygen  and production of a solar fuel has the potential to be cheaper than gasoline 
one process for the creation of a clean and affordable energy supply is the development of
under solar light  this method of sustainable hydrogen production is a key objective in the development of
systems  it is also predicted to be one of the more  if not the most  efficient ways of obtaining hydrogen from water  the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen via a water-splitting process assisted by photosemiconductor catalysts is one of the most promising technologies in development    this process has the potential for large quantities of hydrogen to be generated in an ecologically sound manner    the conversion of solar energy into a clean fuel  h2  under ambient conditions is one of the greatest challenges facing scientists in the twenty-first century 
two approaches are generally recognized in the construction of solar fuel cells for hydrogen production 
a homogeneous system is one where catalysts are not   that is  components are present in the same compartment  this means that hydrogen and oxygen are produced in the same location  this can be a drawback  since they compose an explosive mixture  demanding gas product separation  also  all components must be active in approximately the same conditions  e g     
a heterogeneous system has two separate   an anode and a cathode  making possible the separation of oxygen and hydrogen production  furthermore  different components do not necessarily need to work in the same conditions  however  the increased complexity of these systems makes them harder to develop and more expensive 
another area of research within artificial photosynthesis is the selection and manipulation of photosynthetic microorganisms  namely green
and   for the production of solar fuels  many
are able to produce hydrogen naturally  and scientists are working to improve them 
such as
and
are produced both at laboratory and commercial scales  this approach has benefited from the development of   which is also being explored by the
to produce a synthetic organism capable of biofuel production 
history  
the artificial photosynthesis was first anticipated by the italian chemist
in 1912  in a lecture that was later published in
he proposed a switch from the use of
to radiant energy provided by the sun and captured by technical photochemistry devices  in this switch he saw a possibility to close the gap between the rich north and poor south and ventured a guess that this switch from
to
would  not be harmful to the progress and to human happiness  
in the late 60s 
discovered the photocatalytic properties of   the so-called honda-fujishima effect  which could be used for  
the swedish consortium for artificial photosynthesis  the first of its kind  was established in 1994 as a collaboration between groups of three different universities   
and   being presently active around
and the ngstrm laboratories in uppsala  the consortium was built with a
approach to focus on learning from natural photosynthesis and applying this knowledge in biomimetic systems 
research into artificial photosynthesis is undergoing a boom at the beginning of the 21st century  in 2000 
 csiro  researchers publicized their intent to focus on carbon dioxide capture and its conversion to hydrocarbons  in 2003  the
announced the discovery of an important intermediate step in the reduction of co2 to co  the simplest possible carbon dioxide reduction reaction   which could lead to better catalysts 
one of the drawbacks of artificial systems for water-splitting catalysts is their general reliance on scarce  expensive elements  such as ruthenium or rhenium  in 2008  with the funding of the  
chemist and head of the solar revolution project
and postdoctoral fellow matthew kanan attempted to circumvent this issue by using a catalyst containing the cheaper and more abundant elements cobalt and phosphate  the catalyst was able to split water into oxygen and protons using sunlight  and could potentially be coupled to a hydrogen gas producing catalyst such as platinum  furthermore  while the catalyst broke down during catalysis  it could self-repair  this experimental catalyst design was considered a major breakthrough in the field by many researchers 
whereas co is the prime reduction product of co2  more complex carbon compounds are usually desired  in 2008 
reported the direct conversion of carbon dioxide and water to methanol using solar energy in a highly efficient photochemical cell 
while nocera and coworkers had accomplished water splitting to oxygen and protons  a light-driven process to produce hydrogen is desirable  in 2009  the leibniz institute for catalysis reported inexpensive iron carbonyl complexes able to do just that  in the same year  researchers at the
also used iron carbonyl compounds to achieve photoelectrochemical hydrogen production with 60  efficiency  this time using a gold electrode covered with layers of
to which the iron complexes were linked  both of these processes used a molecular approach  where discrete nanoparticles are responsible for catalysis 
visible light water splitting with a one piece multijunction cell was first demonstrated and patented by william ayers at energy conversion devices in 1983  this group demonstrated water photolysis into hydrogen and oxygen  now referred to as an  artificial leaf  or  wireless solar water splitting  with a low cost  thin film amorphous silicon multijunction cell directly immersed in water  hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved from the back metal substrate which also eliminated the hazard of mixed hydrogen oxygen gas evolution  a nafion membrane above the immersed cell provided a path for proton transport  the higher photovoltage available from the multijuction thin film cell with visible light was a major advance over previous photolysis attempts with uv sensitive single junction cells  the group s patent also lists several other semiconductor multijunction compositions in addition to amorphous silicon 
in 2009  f  del valle and k  domen showed the impact of the thermal treatment in a closed atmosphere using cd1-xznxs photocatalysts  cd1-xznxs
reports high activity in hydrogen production from water splitting under sunlight irradiation  a mixed heterogeneous molecular approach by researchers at the   in 2010  using both nitrogen- and
-sensitized titanium dioxide
and   also yielded photoproduced hydrogen 
artificial photosynthesis remained an academic field for many years  however  in the beginning of 2009 
was reported to be developing its own artificial photosynthesis research by using sunlight  water and carbon dioxide to  create the carbon building blocks from which resins  plastics and fibers can be synthesized   this was confirmed with the establishment of the kaiteki institute later that year  with carbon dioxide reduction through artificial photosynthesis as one of the main goals 
in 2010  the
established  as one of its   the   the mission of jcap is to find a cost-effective method to produce fuels using only sunlight  water  and carbon-dioxide as inputs  jcap is led by a team from   led by professor
and brings together more than 120 scientists and engineers from
and its lead partner    jcap also draws on the expertise and capabilities of key partners from   the       and   and the   in addition  jcap serves as a central hub for other solar fuels research teams across the united states  including 20 doe energy frontier research center  the program has a budget of  122m over five years  subject to congressional appropriation
also in 2010  a team led by professor
at the
successfully demonstrated photosynthesis in an artificial construct consisting of enzymes suspended in a foam housing 
in 2011  daniel nocera and his research team announced the creation of the first practical artificial leaf  in a speech at the 241st national meeting of the   nocera described an advanced solar cell the size of a poker card capable of splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen  approximately ten times more efficient than natural photosynthesis  the cell is mostly made of inexpensive materials that are widely available  works under simple conditions  and shows increased stability over previous catalysts  in laboratory studies  the authors demonstrated that an artificial leaf prototype could operate continuously for at least forty-five hours without a drop in activity  in may 2012  sun catalytix  the startup based on nocera s research  stated that it will not be scaling up the prototype as the device offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight  leading experts in the field have supported a proposal for a global project on artificial photosynthesis as a combined energy security and climate change solution  conferences on this theme have been held at lord howe island in 2011  at chicheley hall in the uk in 2014 and at canberra and lord howe island in 2016 
current research  
in energy terms  natural photosynthesis can be divided in three steps 
in bacteria and plants capture photons and transduce them into electrons  injecting them into the photosynthetic chain 
along several cofactors of the photosynthetic chain  causing local  spatial  
redox catalysis  which uses the aforementioned transferred electrons to oxidize water to dioxygen and protons  these protons can in some species be utilized for  
a triad assembly  with a photosensitizer  p  linked in tandem to a water oxidation catalyst  d  and a hydrogen evolving catalyst  a   electrons flow from d to a when catalysis occurs 
using
approaches  artificial photosynthesis tries to construct systems doing the same type of processes  ideally  a
assembly could oxidize water with one catalyst  reduce protons with another and have a
molecule to power the whole system  one of the simplest designs is where the photosensitizer is linked in tandem between a water oxidation catalyst and a hydrogen evolving catalyst 
the photosensitizer transfers electrons to the hydrogen catalyst when hit by light  becoming oxidized in the process 
this drives the water splitting catalyst to donate electrons to the photosensitizer  in a triad assembly  such a catalyst is often referred to as a donor  the oxidized donor is able to perform water oxidation 
the state of the triad with one catalyst oxidized on one end and the second one reduced on the other end of the triad is referred to as a charge separation  and is a driving force for further electron transfer  and consequently catalysis  to occur  the different components may be assembled in diverse ways  such as
complexes  compartmentalized cells  or linearly 
linked molecules 
research into finding catalysts that can convert water  carbon dioxide  and sunlight to carbohydrates or hydrogen is a current  active field  by studying the natural
 oec   researchers have developed catalysts such as the  blue dimer  to mimic its function or inorganic-based materials such as birnessite with the similar building block as the oec 
that reduce carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide  co   formic acid  hcooh  and methanol  ch3oh  are under development  however  these catalysts are still very inefficient 
hydrogen catalysts  
hydrogen is the simplest solar fuel to synthesize  since it involves only the transference of two electrons to two protons  it must  however  be done stepwise  with formation of an intermediate
anion 
2 e   2 h   h    h  h2
the proton-to-hydrogen converting catalysts present in nature are   these are
that can either reduce protons to molecular hydrogen or oxidize hydrogen to protons and electrons 
and
studies spanning several decades have resulted in a good understanding of both the structure and mechanism of hydrogenase catalysis  using this information  several molecules
the structure of the active site of both
and iron-iron hydrogenases have been synthesized  other catalysts are not structural mimics of hydrogenase but rather functional ones  synthesized catalysts include structural h-cluster models  a dirhodium photocatalyst  and
catalysts 
water-oxidizing catalysts  
water oxidation is a more complex chemical reaction than proton reduction  in nature  the
performs this reaction by accumulating reducing equivalents  electrons  in a manganese-calcium cluster within
 ps ii   then delivering them to water molecules  with the resulting production of molecular oxygen and protons 
2 h2o  o2   4 h    4e
without a catalyst  natural or artificial  
is very endothermic  requiring high temperatures  at least 2500 k  
the exact structure of the oxygen-evolving complex has been hard to determine experimentally  as of 2011  the most detailed model was from a 1.9  resolution crystal structure of photosystem ii  the complex is a
containing four
and one
ions  but the exact location and mechanism of water oxidation within the cluster is unknown  nevertheless  bio-inspired manganese and manganese-calcium complexes have been synthesized  such as  mn4o4    some with catalytic activity 
some
complexes  such as the dinuclear -oxo-bridged  blue dimer   the first of its kind to be synthesized   are capable of light-driven water oxidation  thanks to being able to form high
states  in this case  the ruthenium complex acts as both photosensitizer and catalyst 
many metal oxides have been found to have water oxidation catalytic activity  including
 ruo2   iridium iv  oxide  iro2   cobalt oxides  including -   
 including layered mno2  birnessite   mn2o3   and a mix of mn2o3 with camn2o4  oxides are easier to obtain than molecular catalysts  especially those from relatively abundant transition metals  cobalt and manganese   but suffer from low
and slow
properties  and their mechanism of action is hard to decipher and  therefore  to adjust 
recently
 mof -based materials have been shown to be a highly promising candidate for water oxidation with first row transition metals  the stability and tunability of this system is projected to be highly beneficial for future development 
photosensitizers  
structure of   a broadly used photosensitizer 
nature uses   mainly   to absorb a broad part of the visible spectrum  artificial systems can use either one type of pigment with a broad absorption range or combine several pigments for the same purpose 
ruthenium   in particular
and its derivatives  have been extensively used in hydrogen photoproduction due to their efficient visible light absorption and long-lived consequent
  which makes the complexes strong reducing agents  other noble metal-containing complexes used include ones with  
and  
metal-free organic complexes have also been successfully employed as photosensitizers  examples include
and   pyrrole rings such as porphyrins have also been used in coating
or
for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis 
as part of current research efforts artificial photonic antenna systems are being studied to determine efficient and sustainable ways to collect light for artificial photosynthesis  gion calzaferri  2009  describes one such antenna that uses zeolite l as a host for organic dyes  to mimic plant s light collecting systems  the material may be interfaced to an external device via a stopcock intermediate 
carbon dioxide reduction catalysts  
in nature 
is done by
using the enzyme
as a part of the   rubisco is a rather slow catalyst compared to the vast majority of other enzymes  incorporating only a few molecules of carbon dioxide into
per minute  but does so at atmospheric pressure and in mild  biological conditions  the resulting product is further
and eventually used in the synthesis of   which in turn is a precursor to more complex   such as
and   the process consumes energy in the form of
and  
artificial co2 reduction for fuel production aims mostly at producing reduced carbon compounds from atmospheric co2  some
complexes have been developed for this end  however  they usually require previous concentration of co2 before use  and carriers  molecules that would fixate co2  that are both stable in aerobic conditions and able to concentrate co2 at atmospheric concentrations haven t been yet developed  the simplest product from co2 reduction is
 co   but for fuel development  further reduction is needed  and a key step also needing further development is the transfer of hydride anions to co 
other materials and components  
charge separation is a key property of dyad and triad assemblies  some nanomaterials employed are
 such as    a strategy that explores the
properties of these materials  diverse modifications   and non-covalent  of carbon nanotubes have been attempted to increase the efficiency of charge separation  including the addition of
and pyrrole-like molecules such as
and  
since photodamage is usually a consequence in many of the tested systems after a period of exposure to light  bio-inspired photoprotectants have been tested  such as
 which are used in photosynthesis as natural protectants  
light-driven methodologies under development  
photoelectrochemical cells  
main article 
photoelectrochemical cells are a heterogeneous system that use light to produce either electricity or hydrogen  the vast majority of photoelectrochemical cells use semiconductors as catalysts  there have been attempts to use synthetic manganese complex-impregnated
as a working electrode  but it has been since shown that the catalytically active species is actually the broken-down complex 
a promising  emerging type of solar cell is the   this type of cell still depends on a semiconductor  such as tio2  for current conduction on one electrode  but with a coating of an organic or inorganic dye that acts as a photosensitizer  the counter electrode is a platinum catalyst for h2 production  these cells have a self-repair mechanism and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies rivaling those of
semiconductor ones 
photocatalytic water splitting in homogeneous systems  
main article 
direct water oxidation by photocatalysts is a more efficient usage of solar energy than
water splitting because it avoids an intermediate thermal or electrical energy conversion step 
bio-inspired manganese clusters have been shown to possess water oxidation activity when
on
together with ruthenium photosensitizers  although with low turnover numbers 
as mentioned above  some ruthenium complexes are able to oxidize water under solar light irradiation  although their photostability is still an issue  many can be reactivated by a simple adjustment of the conditions they work in  improvement of catalyst stability has been tried resorting to   in particular ruthenium-based ones 
whereas a fully functional artificial system is usually envisioned when constructing a water splitting device  some mixed approaches have been tried  one of these involve the use of a
to which photosystem ii is linked  an electric current is detected upon illumination 
hydrogen-producing artificial systems  
a h-cluster fefe hydrogenase model compound covalently linked to a ruthenium photosensitizer  the ruthenium complex absorbs light and transduces its energy to the iron compound  which can then reduce protons to h2 
the simplest photocatalytic hydrogen production unit consists of a hydrogen-evolving catalyst linked to a photosensitizer  in this
assembly  a so-called sacrificial donor for the photosensitizer is needed  that is  one that is externally supplied and replenished  the photosensitizer donates the necessary reducing equivalents to the hydrogen-evolving catalyst  which uses protons from a solution where it is immersed or dissolved in  cobalt compounds such as
are some of the best hydrogen catalysts  having been coupled to both metal-containing and metal-free photosensitizers  the first h-cluster models linked to photosensitizers  mostly ruthenium photosensitizers  but also porphyrin-derived ones  were prepared in the early 2000s  both types of assembly are under development to improve their stability and increase their   both necessary for constructing a sturdy  long-lived solar fuel cell 
as with water oxidation catalysis  not only fully artificial systems have been idealized  hydrogenase enzymes themselves have been engineered for photoproduction of hydrogen  by coupling the enzyme to an artificial photosensitizer  such as  ru bipy 3 2  or even  
nadp  nadph coenzyme-inspired catalyst  
in natural photosynthesis  the
is reducible to nadph through binding of a
and two   this reduced form can then deliver the proton and electrons  potentially as a   to reactions that culminate in the production of
 the    the
is recyclable in a natural photosynthetic cycle  but this process is yet to be artificially replicated 
a current goal is to obtain an nadph-inspired catalyst capable of recreating the natural cyclic process  utilizing light 
donors would be regenerated and produced where the molecules are continuously used in a closed cycle  brookhaven chemists are now using a -based complex to serve as the acting model  the complex is proven to perform correspondingly with nadp  nadph  behaving as the foundation for the proton and two electrons needed to convert
to  
currently  brookhaven researchers are aiming to find ways for light to generate the hydride donors  the general idea is to use this process to produce fuels from  
photobiological production of fuels  
some
microorganisms can  under certain conditions  produce hydrogen 
microorganisms  such as filamentous   possess the enzyme   responsible for conversion of atmospheric n2 into   molecular hydrogen is a byproduct of this reaction  and is many times not released by the microorganism  but rather taken up by a hydrogen-oxidizing  uptake  hydrogenase  one way of forcing these organisms to produce hydrogen is then to annihilate uptake hydrogenase activity  this has been done on a strain of   one of the
of the nife uptake hydrogenase was inactivated by   and the mutant strain showed hydrogen evolution under illumination 
many of these photoautotrophs also have bidirectional hydrogenases  which can produce hydrogen under certain conditions  however  other energy-demanding
can compete with the necessary electrons for proton reduction  decreasing the efficiency of the overall process  also  these hydrogenases are very sensitive to oxygen 
several carbon-based biofuels have also been produced using cyanobacteria  such as 1-butanol 
synthetic biology techniques are predicted to be useful in this field  microbiological and enzymatic engineering have the potential of improving enzyme efficiency and robustness  as well as constructing new biofuel-producing metabolic pathways in photoautotrophs that previously lack them  or improving on the existing ones  another field under development is the optimization of
for commercial application 
employed research techniques  
research in artificial photosynthesis is necessarily a multidisciplinary field  requiring a multitude of different expertise  some techniques employed in making and investigating catalysts and solar cells include 
and
 
methods  such as     electrochemical impedance spectroscopy   and  
spectroscopic methods 
fast techniques  such as
and  
magnetic resonance spectroscopies  such as    
x-ray spectroscopy methods  including x-ray absorption such as
and   but also x-ray emission 
 
 
and
methodologies 
advantages  disadvantages  and efficiency  
advantages of solar fuel production through artificial photosynthesis include 
the solar energy can be immediately converted and stored  in
cells  sunlight is converted into electricity and then converted again into chemical energy for storage  with some necessary loss of energy associated with the second conversion 
the byproducts of these reactions are environmentally friendly  artificially photosynthesized fuel would be a
source of energy  which could be used for transportation or homes 
disadvantages include 
materials used for artificial photosynthesis often corrode in water  so they may be less stable than
over long periods of time  most hydrogen catalysts are very sensitive to oxygen  being inactivated or degraded in its presence  also  photodamage may occur over time 
the overall cost is not yet advantageous enough to compete with
as a commercially viable source of energy 
a concern usually addressed in catalyst design is efficiency  in particular how much of the incident light can be used in a system in practice  this is comparable with   where light-to-chemical-energy conversion is measured  photosynthetic organisms are able to collect about 50  of incident solar radiation  however the theoretical limit of photosynthetic efficiency is 4.6 and 6.0  for c3 and c4 plants respectively  in reality  the efficiency of photosynthesis is much lower and is usually below 1   with some exceptions such as
in tropical climate  in contrast  the highest reported efficiency for artificial photosynthesis lab prototypes is 22.4   however  plants are efficient in using co2 at atmospheric concentrations  something that artificial catalysts still cannot perform
