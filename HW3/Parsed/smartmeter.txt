overview  
the term smart meter often refers to an   but it also may mean a device measuring
or
consumption 
similar meters  usually referred to as
or time-of-use meters  have existed for years  but  smart meters  usually involve real-time or near real-time sensors 
notification  and power quality monitoring  these additional features are more than simple
 amr   they are similar in many respects to
 ami  meters  interval and time-of-use meters historically have been installed to measure commercial and industrial customers  but may not have automatic reading 
research by   the uk consumer group  showed that as many as one in three confuse smart meters with energy monitors  also known as in-home display monitors  the roll-out of smart meters is one strategy for energy savings  while energy suppliers in the uk could save around 300 million a year from their introduction  consumer benefits will depend on people actively changing their energy use  for example  time of use tariffs offering lower rates at off-peak times  and selling electricity back to the grid with   may also benefit consumers 
the installed base of smart meters in europe at the end of 2008 was about 39 million units  according to analyst firm berg insight  globally  pike research found that smart meter shipments were 17.4 million units for the first quarter of 2011  visiongain has determined that the value of the global smart meter market will reach  7bn in 2012 
smart meters may be part of a   but alone  they do not constitute a smart grid 
brief history  
in 1972    while working with
in   developed a sensor monitoring system that used digital transmission for security  fire and medical alarm systems as well as meter reading capabilities for all utilities  this technology was a spin-off of the automatic telephone line identification system  now known as  
in 1974  mr  paraskevakos was awarded a u s  patent for this technology  in 1977  he launched metretek  inc   which developed and produced the first fully automated  commercially available remote meter reading and load management system  since this system was developed pre-internet  metretek utilized the ibm series 1 mini-computer  for this approach  mr  paraskevakos and metretek were awarded multiple patents 
purpose  
since the inception of electricity
and market-driven pricing throughout the world  utilities have been looking for a means to match consumption with generation  traditional electrical and gas meters only measure total consumption  and so provide no information of when the energy was consumed at each metered site  smart meters provide a way of measuring this site-specific information  allowing utility companies to introduce different prices for consumption based on the time of day and the season 
utility companies propose that from a consumer perspective  smart metering offers potential benefits to householders  these include  a  an end to estimated bills  which are a major source of complaints for many customers b  a tool to help consumers better manage their energy purchases - stating that smart meters with a display outside their homes could provide up-to-date information on gas and electricity consumption and in doing so help people to manage their energy use and reduce their energy bills  electricity pricing usually peaks at certain predictable times of the day and the season  in particular  if generation is constrained  prices can rise if power from other jurisdictions or more costly generation is brought online  proponents assert that billing customers at a higher rate for peak times will encourage consumers to adjust their consumption habits to be more responsive to market prices and assert further  that regulatory and market design agencies hope these    could delay the construction of additional generation or at least the purchase of energy from higher priced sources  thereby controlling the steady and rapid increase of electricity prices    there are some concerns  however  that low income and vulnerable consumers may not benefit from intraday time-of-use tariffs 
an academic study based on existing trials showed that homeowners  electricity consumption on average is reduced by approximately 3-5  
the ability to connect disconnect service and read meter consumption remotely are major labor savings for the utility and can result in large layoffs of meter readers 
implementation examples  
the american council for an energy-efficient economy reviewed more than 36 different residential smart metering and feedback programmes internationally  this is the most extensive study of its kind  as of january 2011   their conclusion was  to realise potential feedback-induced savings  advanced meters  smart meters  must be used in conjunction with in-home  or on-line  displays and well-designed programmes that successfully inform  engage  empower and motivate people   there are near universal calls from both the energy industry and consumer groups for a national social marketing campaign to help raise awareness of smart metering and give customers the information and support they need to become more energy efficient  and what changes they must make to realize the potential of proposed smart meters 
australia  
in 2004  the essential services commission of  
 esc  released its changes to the electricity customer metering code and procedure to implement its decision to mandate interval meters for 2.6 million victorian electricity customers 
the esc s final paper titled  mandatory rollout of interval meters for electricity customers  foreshadowed the changes to be implemented and contained the rollout timetable requiring interval meters to be installed for all small businesses and residences  the rollout commenced in mid-2009 and was completed at the end of 2013 
the commonwealth issued a joint communiqu at the council of australian governments meeting in canberra on 10 february 2006 committing all governments to the progressive rollout of smart metering technology from 2007 
in 2009 the victorian auditor general undertook a review of the program and found that there were  significant inadequacies  in advice to government and that project governance  has not been appropriate  
meters installed in victoria have been deployed with limited smart functionality that is being increased over time  30-minute interval data is available  remote cut-off and start-up energization is available  and the home area network will be available for households in 2012 
in may 2010 it was reported that the program was expected to cost  500 million more than originally estimated by proponents  with a total cost of  1.6 billion 
in november 2010 the victorian labor party was voted out of state government  the incoming coalition stated that the meter program would be reviewed and the auditor general s recommendations implemented  specifically commenting on program governance  customer data protection  and cost recovery  in january 2011 the energy minister  michael o brien  said he was not ruling out a suspension of the program  this review  delivered in december 2012 endorsed the continuation of the roll out  with minor changes 
the victorian government after initially halting the planned implementation of time-of-use tariffs for general consumers has now allowed their introduction from mid-2013 
as shown in the chart below  victorian metering charges increased by approximately  60 per meter per year after the introduction of ami cost recovery from customers in 2010 and a projected increase to 125.73 by 2016-2017 
by mid-july 2013  the first smart meter in-home displays were being made available to victorian consumers  at the beginning of 2014 there were three approved smart meter in-home displays directly available to consumers 
annual meter charge increases with smart meter costs in 2010 and projections to 2017

canada  
the
in  
has worked to define the technology
and develop the regulatory framework for its implementation  the
set a target of deploying smart meters to 800,000 homes and small businesses  i e  small  general service  customers under 50kw demand  by the end of 2007  which was surpassed  and throughout the province by the end of 2010 
in  
has implemented
smart meters to most of its customers by the end of 2012 
smart meter installations have been associated with several fires in canada but these were probably caused by preexisting problems unrelated to the meters  bc hydro maintains that  the risk of a smart meter installation causing an electrical problem is extremely low  and will assist homeowners if repairs are necessary for a safe installation 
in november 2011  the union of british columbia municipalities voted in favour of a
to temporarily suspend smart meter installations  the provincial government insists that installations will proceed  based on global standards  as of may 2012  39 municipalities in british columbia have passed motions opposing the installation of smart meters  the utility company  bc hydro  is not legally obliged to abide by these city decisions  in september 2013 bc hydro announced the  meter choices program  which allows customers to keep their old meter or have a smart meter with the radio off  both options have an additional monthly
fee of  30.00 per month 
italy  
the world s largest smart meter deployment was undertaken by   the dominant utility in
with more than 30 million customers  between 2000 and 2005 enel deployed smart meters to its entire customer base 
these meters are fully electronic and smart  with integrated bi-directional communications  advanced power measurement and management capabilities  an integrated  software-controllable disconnect switch  and an all solid-state design  they communicate over low voltage power line using standards-based power line technology from
to echelon data concentrators at which point they communicate via ip to enel s enterprise servers  demonstrating that with power line communication  smart meters don t require wifi radios 
the system provides a wide range of advanced features  including the ability to remotely turn power on or off to a customer  read usage information from a meter  detect a service outage  change the maximum amount of electricity that a customer may demand at any time  detect  unauthorized  use of electricity and remotely shut it off  and remotely change the meter s billing plan from credit to prepay  as well as  from flat-rate to multi-tariff 
japan  
the energy conservation center
in japan promotes energy efficiency including smart metering  public utilities have started to test metering with integrated communication devices  private entities have already implemented efficient energy systems with integrated feedback methods such as alerts or triggers 
netherlands  
the company
introduced the first smart meter for both electricity and gas in the
in 2005  in 2007  the dutch government proposed that all seven million households of the country should have a smart meter by 2013  as part of a national energy reduction plan 
in august 2008 the roll out of these seven million meters was delayed for several reasons  main reasons for the delay were that there was limited possibility foreseen to register small scale local energy production  e g  by solar panels   and that there was uncertainty in the parliament on future developments in smart meters 
on april 7  2009 the dutch government had to back down after consumer groups raised privacy concerns  instead of a mandatory roll-out smart meters will be voluntary 
new zealand  
in november 2005  energy supplier
introduced the usage of smart meters in the
area with more than 1000 households participating  by late 2006  over 6,300 smart meters had been installed as part of the initial trial  on june 28  2007 the first roll-out began for households in
and there are plans to install more than 112,000 smart meters by january 2009  these smart meters are made by a christchurch-based company 
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of meridian energy 
in june 2009  the parliamentary commissioner for the environment released a report  which was critical of the  lack of smartness  in the 150,000 smart meters installed in new zealand thus far  dr jan wright called for government leadership for this  infrastructure of national importance   dr wright emphasised that the meters were capable of being smart  but that the failure to include the
chips at the initial installation meant that currently only the power retailers benefited  not consumers  nor the environment 
in 2015 the new zealand office of the
raised concerns that smart meters recorded personal information including the time that homeowners were home or not  the office said  the  smart meter  readings undoubtedly contained private information  and power companies needed to be more upfront about their handling of the torrent of personal information gathered by smart meters  
nordic countries  
northern europe became the hotspot for amm  advanced metering management  in europe in 2003 when
announced the decision to require monthly readings of all electricity meters by 2009  soon activities spread to the other nordic countries      and
decided to deploy amm in
as well as in sweden  as the leading industry players in both countries at the time 
developments in
took off in 2004 with several ambitious projects being announced by the countrys largest utilities 
has taken a more cautious stance  but in june 2007 the norwegian energy authority  nve  declared that it would recommend new legislation requiring smart meters to take effect in 2013  as of august 2007  almost all of the dsos in sweden had signed contracts for amm solutions  norway was lagging behind with just 6 percent  altogether contracts for nearly 8 million smart meters are still open in the nordic region 
spain  
information gathered from  smartregions  program  summary of the european smartmettering deployment 
spain is a country with 46 million inhabitants and approximately 26 million electricity customers  three major energy players act in the country      and    with a market share of almost 95   esma  2010  26-28  provides a good overview of the situation in spain  by 2013  endesa has replaced about 30  of meters  based on the meters and more technology   of about 3.5 million customers 
regulations existing in spain related to implementation of smart meters 
rd 1634/2006  order to the regulator  comisin nacional de energa  cne  about a substitution plan including the substitution plan for all spanish residential meters  criteria for the substitution and number of meters to install every year  percentage of the total equipment
orden itc 3860/2007  publication of the criteria for the substitution plan  including that every distributor has to present its own plan and amm system design
based on the royal decrees a meter substitution plan was established with an obligation to install smart meters for all consumers under 15kw by 2018  by 31 december 2010  30  of the contracts from each distribution company below 15kw should have the smart meter installed  distribution companies are responsible for the installation of the meters 
the smart metering obligations were established in december 2007 with the national meter substitution plan for end-users up to 15kw  the aim is to support remote energy management systems  the plan is managed by the ministry of industry  with a deadline for the completion of the plan by 31 december 2018  all dsos had to submit their substitution plans to the regional governments  a binding target of 30  of all customers was set for 2010  this initial target could not be reached by any of the dsos  however  due to a late approval of the substitution plan  in may 2009   technological uncertainties in terms of system communication  alleged supply problems of certified meters that were available only in june 2010 and ongoing negotiations with the regulators about the level of cost acceptance 
united kingdom  
in august 2007  the uk government consulted on smart meter roll-out  the consultation attached the necessary draft regulations and proposed that from 2008 domestic customers provide comparative historical consumption data and electricity suppliers provide a real-time display unit within time limits  and  for business  gas and electricity suppliers install smart meters in those parts of the sme sector  where it has been shown to be cost-effective to do so and where such a meter is not already installed 
in december 2009  the united kingdom s department of energy and climate change announced its intention to have smart meters in all homes in great britain by 2020  the model is a competitive-supplier-led rollout with a central communications body  called the data and communications company  dcc   which was established in september 2013  as well as the dcc  the government established smart energy gb to lead the nationwide publicity for the rollout programme 
the united kingdom rollout is considered to be the largest programme ever undertaken  involving visits to 30 million homes and 2 million small businesses to replace meters for both gas and electricity  most households will have smart meters installed by their energy company between 2015 and 2020  although some energy companies are starting to install smart meters already  at the end of 2013 there were 295,700 smart meters installed in domestic properties in great britain 
in order to decide whether or not to mandate the rollout of smart meters  impact assessments by government help establish if there is a positive business case for britain to roll out smart metering  these look at the potential costs and benefits of rolling out smart meters to suppliers  network operators  customers  and britain as a whole  deccs impact assessment  updated in january 2014  concludes that there is a positive business case overall of a smart meter rollout of 6.2 billion of net benefits 
in may 2013 the government reviewed the programme timetable  the government tested the time needed for the design  build and test phases of industrys programmes  the consistent message was that more time was needed if the roll-out of smart meters were to get off to the best possible start and if customers were to be sure of a quality service  the government therefore now expects that the smart meter roll-outs will be completed by the end of 2020 
consumer groups such as consumer focus
and the consumers association        have raised concerns about the extent to which consumer interests will be protected during the roll-out  for example  there has been concern that consumers may experience pressure selling while energy representatives are in their homes fitting meters  the government has now banned sales activities during meter installation visits
and put in place a number of consumer protection measures  including ensuring that consumers will have choice and control over how their energy consumption data is used  apart from where it is required for billing purposes 
in march 2016  figures released by the department for energy and climate change  showed that only 2.3 million smart meters had been installed in uk homes  this was well behind schedule to hit the governments target to have 50 million in place by 2020 
the han is implemented using

germany  
on 8 july 2016  the new digitisation of the energy turnaround act cleared the final legislative hurdle in the german federal council   the new law initiates the roll-out of smart meters and connected infrastructures in germany and defines roles and tasks for market participants 
the new act is based on the
introduced by the eu in 2009  the directives of this package require eu member states to equip at least 80  of consumers with intelligent metering systems by 2020  subject to a positive national commercial assessment of the roll-out 
the key objective of the new law is to facilitate the implementation of smart meter and smart meter gateway devices  in that respect  germany implements the eu directives 2009/72 eg and 2009/73 eg into   the act introduces specific and detailed requirements for the design of the smart meter devices and for the transmission of data  the goal is to open up the energy market to digitalisation  while ensuring a high standard of data protection and ict security 
the smart meters operation act  messstellenbetriebsgesetz  sets out  in 77 sections  rules on the marketing and use of smart meters and smart meter gateways 
the act introduced new regulated market roles  particularly the role of the   responsible the implementation  operation and maintenance of smart meters  with specific legal obligations in that role  the responsibility connected with the roll out of the meter operator rests on the energy supply grid operator  versorgungsnetzbetreiber   using a special public procurement procedure  they can transfer this position to a third party service provider  another role is smart meter gateway administrator  responsible for the correct allocation and security of the data collected and delivered by the smart meter gateway 
the act defines technical requirements  particularly the reliability and security of energy measurement and the transmission of data  compliance with the new rules is controlled and supervised by both the
 bundesamt fr sicherheit in der informationstechnik  and the
 bundesnetzagentur  
the act determines a roll-out plan regarding the installation of smart meters  the roll-out will begin in 2017 and continue until 2032  the process comprises different roll-out periods for different types of end consumers and plant operators  depending on the amount of energy consumption that they use and respectively input feed in  for some types of consumers and operators  the roll-out must be completed before the end of 2024 
the act requires operators to equip consumers with more than 6,000 kwh yearly consumption  and plant operators with an installed capacity of more than 7kw  with smart meters  below these consumption levels  equipment is optional 
manufacturers must supply the devices according to certification by the federal office for information security  the federal office for information security provides an overview of its current technical requirements on its website 
ireland  
upon getting into the coalition government in 2007    the
  pledged to introduce smart meters for every home in the
within a five-year period  in an interview the minister said he envisages a situation where smart meters would use plug-in hybrid cars as storage for micro-generated renewable energy by intelligently diverting the energy into the car  a leading energy expert has expressed concerns that whatever system of smart metering arises in ireland must give homeowners the possibility of automatically responding to fluctuating electricity prices by  for instance  buying electricity when at its cheapest  and selling micro-generated electricity from wind turbines or solar photovoltaic panels into the grid when the best price is available 
italy  
as stated above  italy has already deployed smart electrical meters  legislation has recently been released  forcing gas utilities to deploy smart gas meters from large industrial consumers down to almost every residential customer by the end of 2016 
it is expected and desired  that remote reading and management of smart gas meters will be fully independent of the existing system of smart electrical meters  the technology intended to be used  mainly  will be -based  more information can be found on the webpage published by the authority 
iran  
in   like many other developed countries 
implementation is regarded as a unique way for encountering many serious environmental and economic challenges that mankind is faced today 
is the national smart metering program in iran  the functional  technical  security  economic  and general requirements of this project was published as a document after a longtime workgroup of various stakeholders including representative of grid operators  meter manufactures  communication providers  business layer software providers  domestic and international consultants  the procedure of producing this document was base on
methodology  iec 62559   in these technical documents all of the business and functional use cases  the conceptual architecture  mandatory international standards for electric  water and gas metering systems for all types of consumers  telecommunication requirements  system interfaces and security mandates are defined  the ministry of energy decided to perform a pilot project called faham-phase1  inorder to experiment the technical and executional challenges for implementing smart metering for all of the consumers  about thirty million consumers  
malta  
malta is in the process of implementing smart meters in all commercial and private households  enemalta  a governmental company responsible for electricity is responsible for the introduction of the smart meters  this will occur in phases and it is projected that every meter in malta will be  smart  by 2012  this will cost approximately 40 million euros  being paid by the ministry of infrastructure  technology  and communication  the  smart meters  being used in malta are manufactured by   a pilot project is currently underway and more than 5,000 are being installed  the cost of the installation will be totally absorbed by the government  i e  the taxpayers

of all smart meter technologies  one critical technological problem is communication  each meter must be able to reliably and securely communicate the information collected to some central location  considering the varying environments and locations where meters are found  that problem can be daunting  among the solutions proposed are  the use of
and
networks    licensed   combination licensed and unlicensed radio  and   not only the medium used for communication purposes  but also the type of network used  is critical  as such  one would find  fixed wireless 
or a combination of the two  there are several other potential network configurations possible  including the use of
and other
related networks  to date no one solution seems to be optimal for all applications 
have very different communication problems from urban utilities or utilities located in difficult locations such as mountainous regions or areas ill-served by wireless and internet companies 
in addition to communication with the head-end network  smart meters may need to be part of a
which can include an in-premises display and a hub to interface one or more meters with the head end  technologies for this network will vary from country to country but include
and  
protocols  
ansi c12.18 is an
standard that describes a
used for two-way communications with a meter  mostly used in north american markets  the c12.18 standard is written specifically for meter communications via an ansi type 2 optical port  and specifies lower-level protocol details 
specifies the data tables that will be used 
is an extension of c12.18 written for modem instead of optical communications  so it is better suited to  
iec 61107 is a communication protocol for smart meters published by the
that is widely used for utility meters in the european union  it is superseded by   but remains in wide use because it is simple and well-accepted  it sends
data using a   the physical media are either modulated light  sent with an
and received with a   or a pair of wires  usually modulated by   the protocol is   iec 61107 is related to  and sometimes wrongly confused with  the flag protocol 
and landis gyr were early proponents of an interface standard that eventually became a sub-set of iec1107 
the
 osgp  is a family of specifications published by the
 etsi  used in conjunction with the iso iec 14908 control networking standard for smart metering and smart grid applications  millions of smart meters based on osgp are deployed worldwide  numerous major security flaws in the osgp protocol have been identified 
there is a growing trend toward the use of
technology as a common communication platform for smart meter applications  so that utilities can deploy multiple communication systems  while using ip technology as a common management platform  a universal metering interface would allow for development and mass production of smart meters and smart grid devices prior to the communication standards being set  and then for the relevant communication modules to be easily added or switched when they are  this would lower the risk of investing in the wrong standard as well as permit a single product to be used globally even if regional communication standards vary 
some smart meters may use a test ir led to transmit non-encrypted usage data that bypasses meter security by transmitting lower level data in real time 
data management  
the other critical technology for smart meter systems is the information technology at the utility that integrates the smart meter networks with the utility applications  such as billing and cis  this includes the meter data management system 
it also is important for smart grid implementations that
 plc  technologies used within the home over a
 han   are standardized and compatible  the han allows hvac systems and other household appliances to communicate with the smart meter  and from there to the utility  currently there are several broadband or narrowband standards in place  or being developed  that are not yet compatible  in order to address this issue  the national institute for standards and technology    established the pap15 group  which will study and recommend coexistence mechanisms with a focus on the harmonization of plc standards for the han  the objective of the group is to ensure that all plc technologies selected for the han will coexist as a minimum  the two main broadband plc technologies selected are the
 
and itu-t
technologies  technical working groups within these organizations are working to develop appropriate coexistence mechanisms  the
has developed a new standard for smart grid han communications called the
specification  it is interoperable and coexistent with the widely deployed
technology and with the new
global standard and is based on broadband
technology  itu-t commissioned in 2010 a new project called g hnem  to address the home networking aspects of energy management  built upon existing low frequency narrowband ofdm technologies 
 s   until its demise in 2011  was able to use a smart meter for tracking electricity usage  as can emeter s energy engage as in  for example  the powercentsdc tm  demand response program    google powermeter was retired in september 2011 
security  
implementing security protocols that will protect these devices from malicious attacks and new exploits has been a problematic task due to their limited computational resources and long operational life spans 
the current version of
includes the possibility to encrypt 
or
the meter data 
one proposed smart meter data verification method involves analyzing the network traffic in real time to detect anomalies using an
 ids  by identifying exploits as they are being leveraged by attackers  an
 ids  will mitigate the suppliers  risks of energy theft by consumers and denial-of-service attacks by hackers  energy utilities will have to choose between a centralized ids  embedded ids  or dedicated ids depending on the individual needs of the utility  researchers have found that for a typical advanced metering infrastructure  the centralized ids architecture is superior in terms of cost efficiency and security gains 
in the united kingdom  the data communication company  which transports the commands from the supplier to the smart meter  performs an additional anomality check on commands issued  and signed  by the energy supplier 
advanced metering infrastructure  
advanced metering infrastructure  ami  are systems that measure  collect  and analyze energy usage  and communicate with metering devices such as electricity meters  gas meters  heat meters  and water meters  either on request or on a schedule  these systems include hardware  software  communications  consumer energy displays and controllers  customer associated systems 
 mdm  software  and supplier business systems 
government agencies and utilities are turning toward advanced metering infrastructure  ami  systems as part of larger smart grid initiatives  ami extends current advanced meter reading  amr  technology by providing two way meter communications  allowing commands to be sent toward the home for multiple purposes  including  pricing information 
actions  or remote service disconnects  wireless technologies are critical elements of the neighborhood area network  nan   aggregating a mesh configuration of up to thousands of meters for back haul to the utilitys it headquarters 
the network between the measurement devices and business systems allows collection and distribution of information to customers  suppliers    and service providers  this enables these businesses to participate in
services  consumers can use information provided by the system to change their normal consumption patterns to take advantage of lower prices  pricing can be used to curb growth of
consumption  ami differs from traditional
 amr  in that it enables two-way communications with the meter  systems only capable of meter readings do not qualify as ami systems 
opposition and concerns  
some groups have expressed concerns regarding the cost  health  fire risk 
and
effects of smart meters and the remote controllable    that is included with most of them  many of these concerns regard wireless-only smart meters with no home energy monitoring or control or safety features  metering-only solutions  while popular with utilities because they fit existing business models and have cheap up-front capital costs  often result in such  backlash   often the entire
and
concept is discredited in part by confusion about the difference between
and
technology and ami  the attorneys general of both illinois and connecticut have stated that they do not believe smart meters provide any financial benefit to consumers  however  the cost of the installation of the new system will be absorbed by those customers 
health and safety  
most health concerns about the meters arise from the
 rf  radiation emitted by wireless smart meters 
members of the california state assembly asked the
 ccst  to study the issue of potential health impacts from smart meters  the ccst report in april 2011 found no health impacts  based both on lack of scientific evidence of harmful effects from radio frequency  rf  waves and that the rf exposure of people in their homes to smart meters is likely to be minuscule compared to rf exposure to cell phones and microwave ovens 
issues surrounding smart meters causing fires have also been reported  particularly involving the manufacturer sensus  in 2012 
replaced the sensus meters it had deployed in the
region after reports that a number of the units had overheated and caused fires  in july 2014    the province-run utility company of the canadian province of   halted its roll-out of sensus meters after similar  isolated incidents were discovered  shortly afterward 
announced that it would replace 70,000 smart meters that had been deployed in the state of
after similar reports  the company noted that it had been aware of the issues since at least 2013  and that they were limited to certain models it had installed between 2010 and 2012  on july 30  2014  after a total of 8 recent incidents involving the meters  saskpower was ordered by the
to immediately end its smart meter program  and remove the 105,000 smart meters it had installed 
privacy concerns  
one technical reason for privacy concerns is that these meters send detailed information about how much electricity is being used each time  more frequent reports provide more detailed information  infrequent reports may be of little benefit for the provider  as it doesn t allow as good demand management in the response of changing needs for electricity  on the other hand  very frequent reports would allow the utility company to infer
for the occupants of a house  such as when the members of the household are probably asleep or absent  current trends are to increase the frequency of reports  a solution which benefits both the provider and the user s privacy  would be to adapt the interval dynamically  another solution involves an energy storage installed at the household used to reshape the energy consumption profile  in
the electric utility is government owned and as such must comply with privacy laws that prevent the sale of data collected by smart meters  many parts of the world are serviced by private companies that are able to sell their data  in australia debt collectors can make use of the data to know when people are at home  used as evidence in a court case in     police agencies secretly collected smart meter power usage data from thousands of residences to determine which ones were using more power than  typical  in order to find targets to pursue in marijuana growing operations 
smart meter power data usage patterns can reveal much more than how much power is being used  research has been done which has demonstrated that smart meters sampling power levels at two-second intervals can reliably identify when different electrical devices are in use and even what channel or program is being viewed on a television based on the electrical consumption patterns of these devices and the electrical noises that they emit 
opt-out options  
reviews of smart meter programs  moratoriums  delays  and  opt-out  programs are some responses to the concerns of customers and government officials  in response to residents who did not want a smart meter  in june 2012 a utility in hawaii changed their smart meter program to  opt out   the utility said that once the smart grid installation project is nearing completion  kiuc may convert the deferral policy to an opt-out policy or program and may charge a fee to those members to cover the costs of servicing the traditional meters  any fee would require approval from the hawaii public utilities commission 
after receiving numerous complaints about health  hacking  and privacy concerns with the wireless digital devices  the public utility commission of the
state of
voted to allow customers to opt out of the meter change at a cost of  12 a month  in   another us state to consider smart metering recently  regulators declined a request by the state s largest utility    to install 1.2 million of the devices  arguing that the potential savings in electric bills do not justify the cost  cl p already offers its customers time-based rates  the state s attorney general
was quoted as saying the proposal would cause customers to spend upwards of  500 million on meters and get few benefits in return  a claim that connecticut light   power disputed 
lack of savings in results  
there are questions whether electricity is or should be primarily a  when you need it  service where the inconvenience  ratio of time shifting of loads is poor  in the chicago area commonwealth edison ran a test installing smart meters on 8,000 randomly selected households together with variable rates and rebates to encourage cutting back during peak usage  in the crain s chicago business article smart grid test underwhelms  in pilot  few power down to save money  it was reported that fewer than 9  exhibited any amount of peak usage reduction and that the overall amount of reduction was  statistically insignificant   this was from a report by the electric power research institute  a utility industry think tank who conducted the study and prepared the report  susan satter  senior assistant illinois attorney general for public utilities said  it s devastating to their plan      the report shows zero statistically different result compared to business as usual  
by 2016  the 7 million smart meters in texas had failed to produce results 
in the media  
in 2013  take back your power  an independent canadian documentary directed by josh del sol was released describing  dirty electricity  and the aforementioned issues with smart meters  the film explores the various contexts of the health  legal  and economic concerns  and features narration from
of     as well as american researcher de-kun li  journalist blake levitt  and dr  sam milham  it won a
for best feature-length documentary and the annual humanitarian award from
the following year
