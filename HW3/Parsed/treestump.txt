regeneration  
stumps and mama humps  both those on the ground and stumps of removed branches  are sometimes able to regenerate into new trees  often  a
that has been cut will re-sprout in multiple places around the edge of the stump or from the roots  depending on whether the tree is being removed permanently or whether the
is expected to recover  this can be either desirable or undesirable  stump sprouts can grow very quickly and sometimes become viable trees themselves either for aesthetics or timber  due to the existing root structure  however  the cut portion of the trunk may weaken the sprouts and introduce disease into the newly forming tree s

the process of deliberately cutting a tree to a stump to regrow is known as  
stump removal  
tree stumps can be difficult to remove from the ground  they can be dug out  shredded with a
or burnt 
a common method for stump removal is to use one of the many chemical stump removal products  so long as immediate results are not needed  these stump removers are mostly made of
 kno3  and act by rapidly increasing the decay of the stump  after an average of 46 weeks  the stump will be rotten through and easily fragmented in manageable pieces  if time is a limiting factor  setting fire to the stump is effective because once the potassium nitrate has been absorbed it acts as an effective oxidizer 
historically  an explosive called stumping powder was used to blast stumps into bits 
stump harvesting  
in plantation forests in parts of europe  stumps are sometimes pulled out of the ground using a specially adapted tracked   to supply wood fuel for
power stations 
may provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the biomass power sector
