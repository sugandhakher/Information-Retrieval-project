in 1859  a proposal was submitted to the
to use newly filled lands in   boston for a     but the proposal failed  a charter for the
of the massachusetts institute of technology  proposed by   was signed by the
on april 10  1861 
rogers  a professor from the   wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances  he did not wish to found a   but a combination with elements of both professional and   proposing that 
the true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is  as i conceive  the teaching  not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts  which can be done only in the workshop  but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them  and along with this  a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws 
the rogers plan reflected the   emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research  as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories

to fund institutions  to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes   and was a land-grant school  in 1863 under the same act  the commonwealth of massachusetts founded the   which developed as the   in 1866  the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the back bay 
mit was informally called  boston tech   the institute adopted the
and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date  despite chronic financial problems  the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under president   programs in electrical  chemical  marine  and sanitary engineering were introduced  new buildings were built  and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand 
the curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis  with less focus on theoretical science  the fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the mit leadership  during these  boston tech  years  mit faculty and alumni rebuffed
president  and former mit faculty   s repeated attempts to merge mit with harvard college s   there would be at least six attempts to absorb mit into harvard  in its cramped back bay location  mit could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities  driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding  eventually the mit corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with harvard  over the vehement objections of mit faculty  students  and alumni  however  a 1917 decision by the massachusetts supreme judicial court effectively put an end to the merger scheme

in 1916  the mit administration and the mit charter crossed the charles river on the ceremonial barge bucentaur built for the occasion  to signify mit s move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of
on a mile-long tract along the cambridge side of the charles river  the
 new technology  campus was designed by
and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious  mr  smith   starting in 1912  in january 1920  the donor was revealed to be the industrialist
of   who had invented methods of film production and processing  and founded   between 1912 and 1920  eastman donated  20 million   236.6 million in 2015 dollars  in cash and kodak stock to mit 
curricular reforms  
in the 1930s  president
and vice-president  effectively  
emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios  the compton reforms  renewed confidence in the ability of the institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering   unlike
schools  mit catered more to middle-class families  and depended more on
than on
or
for its funding  the school was elected to the
in 1934 
still  as late as 1949  the lewis committee lamented in its report on the state of education at mit that  the institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school   a  partly unjustified  perception the committee sought to change  the report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum  recommended offering a broader education  and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities  the
and the
were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful schools of
and   previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics  management  political science  and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs  the school of humanities  arts  and social sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more
presidents

between 1966 and 1980

at mit included
and guidance systems for
and  

   a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science  engineering  and the arts  we might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives 

mit president   1949
these activities affected mit profoundly  a 1949 report noted the lack of  any great slackening in the pace of life at the institute  to match the return to peacetime  remembering the  academic tranquility of the prewar years   though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities  the faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of   president of mit between 1930 and 1948    president from 1948 to 1957  and   chancellor from 1952 to 1957  whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university  by the 1950s  mit no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades  and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons  philanthropic foundations and the federal government 
in late 1960s and early 1970s  student and faculty activists protested against the
and mit s defense research  in this period mit s various departments were researching helicopters  smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles  the
was founded on march 4  1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems  mit ultimately divested itself from the instrumentation laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the
facility in 1973 in response to the protests  the student body  faculty  and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities  johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to  greater strength and unity  after these times of turmoil  however six mit students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders  such as
and george katsiaficas  are still indignant about mit s role in military research and its suppression of these protests    s film  november actions  records some of these tumultuous events

all undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the general institute requirements  girs   the science requirement  generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors  comprises two semesters of physics  two semesters of calculus  one semester of chemistry  and one semester of biology  there is a laboratory requirement  usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major  the humanities  arts  and social sciences  hass  requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities  arts  and social sciences  including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a hass division  under the communication requirement  two of the hass classes  plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be  communication-intensive   including  substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation   finally  all students are required to complete a
test  non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of
classes 
most classes rely on a combination of lectures  recitations led by associate professors or graduate students  weekly problem sets   p-sets    and periodic quizzes or tests  while the pace and difficulty of mit coursework has been compared to  drinking from a fire hose   the freshmen retention rate at mit is similar to other research universities  the  pass no-record  grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates  for each class taken in the fall term  freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed  or otherwise not have any record of it  in the spring term  passing grades  a  b  c  appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded   grading had previously been  pass no record  all freshman year  but was amended for the class of 2006 to prevent students from

in 1970  the then-dean of institute relations  benson r  snyder  published   arguing that education at mit was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations  and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education  the successful student  according to snyder  was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms  for example  organized student groups had compiled   collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references  this sort of gamesmanship  snyder argued  hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest
