energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the twin pillars of sustainable energy  some ways in which sustainable energy has been defined are

this sets sustainable energy apart from other
terminology such as
by focusing on the ability of an energy source to continue providing energy  sustainable energy can produce some pollution of the environment  as long as it is not sufficient to prohibit heavy use of the source for an indefinite amount of time  sustainable energy is also distinct from   which is sustainable only in the sense that it does not add to the co2 in the atmosphere 
green energy is energy that can be extracted  generated  and or consumed without any significant negative impact to the environment  the planet has a natural capability to recover which means pollution that does not go beyond that capability can still be termed green 
green power is a subset of renewable energy and represents those renewable energy resources and technologies that provide the highest environmental benefit  the

conceptually  one can define three generations of renewables technologies  reaching back more than 100 years  
first-generation technologies emerged from the
at the end of the 19th century and include  
combustion and
and heat  some of these technologies are still in widespread use 
second-generation technologies include
and cooling    modern forms of
and   these are now entering markets as a result of research  development and demonstration  rd d  investments since the 1980s  the initial investment was prompted by
concerns linked to the oil crises   and   of the 1970s but the continuing appeal of these renewables is due  at least in part  to environmental benefits  many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials 
third-generation technologies are still under development and include advanced  
technologies  concentrating
power 
and   advances in
may also play a major role

first- and second-generation technologies have entered the markets  and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long term research and development commitments  where the public sector has a role to play 
regarding energy used by vehicles  a comprehensive 2008

among sources of renewable energy  hydroelectric plants have the advantages of being long-livedmany existing plants have operated for more than 100 years  also  hydroelectric plants are clean and have few emissions  criticisms directed at large-scale hydroelectric plants include  dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned  and release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide during construction and flooding of the reservoir 
are one of the most widely deployed sources of sustainable energy 
however  it has been found that high emissions are associated only with shallow reservoirs in warm  tropical  locales  and recent innovations in hydropower turbine technology are enabling efficient development of low-impact
projects  generally speaking  hydroelectric plants produce much lower life-cycle emissions than other types of generation  hydroelectric power  which underwent extensive development during growth of electrification in the 19th and 20th centuries  is experiencing resurgence of development in the 21st century  the areas of greatest hydroelectric growth are the booming economies of asia  china is the development leader  however  other asian nations are installing hydropower at a rapid pace  this growth is driven by much increased energy costsespecially for imported energyand widespread desires for more domestically produced  clean  renewable  and economical generation

markets for second-generation technologies are strong and growing  but only in a few countries  the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide  strategic deployment in one country not only reduces technology costs for users there  but also for those in other countries  contributing to overall cost reductions and performance improvement

systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors  a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage  and a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use  the systems may be used to heat domestic hot water  swimming pool water  or for space heating  the heat can also be used for industrial applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment  in many climates  a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage  50 to 75   of domestic hot water energy  energy received from the sun by the earth is that of electromagnetic radiation  light ranges of visible  infrared  ultraviolet  x-rays  and radio waves received by the earth through solar energy  the highest power of radiation comes from visible light  solar power is complicated due to changes in seasons and from day to night  cloud cover can also add to complications of solar energy  and not all radiation from the sun reaches earth because it is absorbed and dispersed due to clouds and gases within the earth s atmospheres

enabling technologies for renewable energy  
and
are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed  while enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy  heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power  or in some cases mechanical or thermal power  by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source  such as seawater  lake water  the ground  the air  or waste heat from a process  
thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to   and can involve storage of

energy efficiency  
moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied  but in the way it is used  and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential  opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side  and often offer significant economic benefits 
renewable energy and
are sometimes said to be the  twin pillars  of sustainable energy policy  both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions  efficiency slows down energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use  if energy use grows too fast  renewable energy development will chase a receding target  a recent historical analysis has demonstrated that the rate of
improvements has generally been outpaced by the rate of growth in energy demand  which is due to continuing economic and   as a result  despite energy efficiency gains  total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase  thus  given the thermodynamic and practical limits of energy efficiency improvements  slowing the growth in energy demand is essential  however  unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly  slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions  reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed  any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency 
renewable energy  and energy efficiency  are no longer niche sectors that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists  the increased levels of investment and the fact that much of the capital is coming from more conventional financial actors suggest that sustainable energy options are now becoming mainstream  an example of this would be the  s project with stahl consolidated manufacturing   huntsville  alabama  usa   stahlcon 7   a patented generator shaft designed to reduce emissions within existing power generating systems  granted publishing rights to the alliance in 2007 
concerns coupled with
and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the sustainable energy industries  according to a trend analysis from the   according to   global investment in sustainable energy in 2007 was higher than previous levels  with  148 billion of new money raised in 2007  an increase of 60  over 2006  total financial transactions in sustainable energy  including acquisition activity  was  204 billion 
investment flows in 2007 broadened and diversified  making the overall picture one of greater breadth and depth of sustainable energy use  the mainstream capital markets are  now fully receptive to sustainable energy companies  supported by a surge in funds destined for clean energy investment  
smart-grid technology  
main article 
smart grid refers to a class of technology people are using to bring utility electricity delivery systems into the 21st century  using computer-based remote control and automation  these systems are made possible by two-way communication technology and computer processing that has been used for decades in other industries  they are beginning to be used on electricity networks  from the power plants and wind farms all the way to the consumers of electricity in homes and businesses  they offer many benefits to utilities and consumersmostly seen in big improvements in energy efficiency on the electricity grid and in the energy users homes and offices 
green energy and green power  
a
array is an example of green energy
public seat with integrated solar panel in   anyone can sit and plug in their mobile phone for free charging
green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution  green power is electricity generated from
sources 
      small-scale           and some forms of
 ones which are able to  burn  nuclear waste through a process known as   such as an   and therefore belong in the  green energy  category   some definitions may also include power derived from the
of waste 
some people  including
founder and first member    
and
have specifically classified
as green energy  others  including  s
disagree  claiming that the problems associated with
and the risk of nuclear accidents  such as the   pose an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity  however  newer nuclear reactor designs are capable of utilizing what is now deemed  nuclear waste  until it is no longer  or dramatically less  dangerous  and have design features that greatly minimize the possibility of a nuclear accident  these designs have yet to be proven   see   
some have argued that although green energy is a commendable effort in solving the world s increasing energy consumption  it must be accompanied by a cultural change that encourages the decrease of the world s appetite for energy 
in several
with
arrangements 
arrangements make it possible for consumers to purchase green electricity    from either their utility or a green power provider 
when energy is purchased from the electricity network  the power reaching the consumer will not necessarily be generated from green energy sources  the local     or state power pool buys their electricity from
who may be generating from  
or renewable energy sources  in many countries green energy currently provides a very small amount of electricity  generally contributing less than 2 to 5  to the overall pool  in some u s  states  local governments have formed regional power purchasing pools using
and
to achieve a 51  renewable mix or higher  such as in the city of san francisco 
by participating in a green energy program a consumer may be having an effect on the energy sources used and ultimately might be helping to promote and expand the use of green energy  they are also making a statement to policy makers that they are willing to pay a price premium to support renewable energy  green energy consumers either obligate the utility companies to increase the amount of green energy that they purchase from the pool  so decreasing the amount of non-green energy they purchase   or directly fund the green energy through a green power provider  if insufficient green energy sources are available  the utility must develop new ones or
with a third party energy supplier to provide green energy  causing more to be built  however  there is no way the consumer can check whether or not the electricity bought is  green  or otherwise 
in some countries such as the netherlands  electricity companies guarantee to buy an equal amount of  green power  as is being used by their green power customers  the
government exempts green power from pollution taxes  which means green power is hardly any more expensive than other power 
in the united states  one of the main problems with purchasing green energy through the electrical grid is the current centralized infrastructure that supplies the consumers electricity  this infrastructure has led to increasingly frequent brown outs and black outs  high co2 emissions  higher energy costs  and power quality issues  an additional  450 billion will be invested to expand this fledgling system over the next 20 years to meet increasing demand  in addition  this centralized system is now being further overtaxed with the incorporation of renewable energies such as wind  solar  and geothermal energies  renewable resources  due to the amount of space they require  are often located in remote areas where there is a lower energy demand  the current infrastructure would make transporting this energy to high demand areas  such as urban centers  highly inefficient and in some cases impossible  in addition  despite the amount of renewable energy produced or the economic viability of such technologies only about 20 percent will be able to be incorporated into the grid  to have a more sustainable energy profile  the united states must move towards implementing changes to the electrical grid that will accommodate a mixed-fuel economy 
however  several initiatives are being proposed to mitigate these distribution problems  first and foremost  the most effective way to reduce usas co2 emissions and slow global warming is through conservation efforts  opponents of the current us electrical grid have also advocated for decentralizing the grid  this system would increase efficiency by reducing the amount of energy lost in transmission  it would also be economically viable as it would reduce the amount of power lines that will need to be constructed in the future to keep up with demand  merging heat and power in this system would create added benefits and help to increase its efficiency by up to 80-90   this is a significant increase from the current fossil fuel plants which only have an efficiency of 34  
a more recent concept for improving our electrical grid is to beam microwaves from earth-orbiting satellites or the moon to directly when and where there is demand  the power would be generated from solar energy captured on the lunar surface in this system  the receivers would be  broad  translucent tent-like structures that would receive microwaves and convert them to electricity   nasa said in 2000 that the technology was worth pursuing but it is still too soon to say if the technology will be cost-effective 
the
and several green electricity labelling organizations created the  now defunct 
under which the national green electricity certification schemes could be accredited to ensure that the purchase of green energy leads to the provision of additional new green energy resources

those not satisfied with the third-party grid approach to green energy via the power grid can install their own locally based renewable energy system  renewable energy electrical systems from solar to wind to even local hydro-power in some cases  are some of the many types of renewable energy systems available locally  additionally  for those interested in heating and cooling their dwelling via renewable energy 
systems that tap the constant

the advantage of this approach in the united states is that many states offer incentives to offset the cost of installation of a renewable energy system  in california  massachusetts and several other u s  states  a new approach to community energy supply called
has provided communities with the means to solicit a competitive electricity supplier and use municipal revenue bonds to finance development of local green energy resources  individuals are usually assured that the electricity they are using is actually produced from a green energy source that they control  once the system is paid for  the owner of a renewable energy system will be producing their own renewable electricity for essentially no cost and can sell the excess to the local utility at a profit

renewable energy  after its generation  needs to be stored in a medium for use with autonomous devices as well as vehicles  also  to provide household electricity in remote areas  that is areas which are not connected to the    energy storage is required for use with renewable energy  energy generation and consumption systems used in the latter case are usually  
some examples are 
energy carriers as           to power vehicles 
 
is more usable in stationary applications  e g  to power homes and offices   in household power systems  conversion of energy can also be done to reduce smell  for example  organic matter such as cow dung and spoilable organic matter can be converted to   to eliminate emissions 
is then used 
usually however  renewable energy is derived from the mains electricity grid  this means that energy storage is mostly not used  as the mains electricity grid is organised to produce the exact amount of energy being consumed at that particular moment  energy production on the mains electricity grid is always set up as a combination of  large-scale  renewable energy plants  as well as other power plants as
and   this combination however  which is essential for this type of energy supply  as e g  wind turbines  solar power plants etc   can only produce when the wind blows and the sun shines  this is also one of the main drawbacks of the system as fossil fuel powerplants are polluting and are a main cause of
 nuclear power being an exception   although fossil fuel power plants too can be made emissionless  through carbon capture and storage   as well as renewable  if the plants are converted to e g  biomass  the best solution is still to phase out the latter power plants over time  nuclear power plants too can be more or less eliminated from their problem of nuclear waste through the use of
and newer plants as
and
plants 
renewable energy power plants do provide a steady flow of energy  for example  hydropower plants  ocean thermal plants  osmotic power plants all provide power at a regulated pace  and are thus available power sources at any given moment  even at night  windstill moments etc    at present however  the number of steady-flow renewable energy plants alone is still too small to meet energy demands at the times of the day when the irregular producing renewable energy plants cannot produce power 
besides the greening of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants  another option is the distribution and immediate use of power from solely renewable sources  in this set-up energy storage is again not necessary  for example 
has proposed to distribute solar power from the sahara to europe  europe can distribute wind and ocean power to the sahara and other countries  in this way  power is produced at any given time as at any point of the planet as the sun or the wind is up or ocean waves and currents are stirring  this option however is probably not possible in the short-term  as fossil fuel and nuclear power are still the main sources of energy on the mains electricity net and replacing them will not be possible overnight 
several
have been done  worldwide there is over 100gw of   this improves efficiency and decreases energy losses but a conversion to an energy storing mains electricity grid is a very costly solution  some costs could potentially be reduced by making use of energy storage equipment the consumer buys and not the state  an example is
in electric cars that would double as an energy buffer for the electricity grid  however besides the cost  setting-up such a system would still be a very complicated and difficult procedure  also  energy storage apparatus  as car batteries are also built with materials that pose a threat to the environment  e g  lithium   the combined production of batteries for such a large part of the population would still have environmental concerns  besides car batteries however  other
projects make use of less polluting energy carriers  e g  compressed air tanks and flywheel energy storage

 usepa  green power partnership is a voluntary program that supports the organizational procurement of
by offering expert advice  technical support  tools and resources  this can help organizations lower the transaction costs of buying renewable power  reduce   and communicate its leadership to key stakeholders 
throughout the country  more than half of all u s  electricity customers now have an option to purchase some type of green power product from a retail   roughly one-quarter of the nation s utilities offer green power programs to customers  and voluntary retail sales of renewable energy in the united states totaled more than 12 billion kilowatt-hours in 2006  a 40  increase over the previous year 
sustainable energy research  
there are numerous organizations within the academic  federal  and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of sustainable energy  this research spans several areas of focus across the sustainable energy spectrum  most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields  multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on sustainable energy in recent years  two of the most prominent of these labs are
and the
 nrel   both of which are funded by the
and supported by various corporate partners  sandia has a total budget of  2.4 billion
while nrel has a budget of  375 million 
scientific production towards sustainable energy systems is rising exponentially  growing from about 500 english journal papers only about renewable energy in 1992 to almost 9,000 papers in 2011 
solar  
main articles 
and
the primary obstacle that is preventing the large scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology  currently  photovoltaic  pv  panels only have the ability to convert around 16  of the sunlight that hits them into electricity  at this rate  many experts believe that solar energy is not efficient enough to be economically sustainable given the cost to produce the panels themselves  both
and the
 nrel   have heavily funded solar research programs  the nrel solar program has a budget of around  75 million
and develops research projects in the areas of
 pv  technology  solar thermal energy  and solar radiation  the budget for sandias solar division is unknown  however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratorys  2.4 billion budget  several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years  the solar energy research center  serc  at
 unc  has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology  in 2008  researchers at
 mit  developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water  such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining  in february 2012  north carolina-based semprius inc   a solar development company backed by german corporation   announced that they had developed the worlds most efficient solar panel  the company claims that the prototype converts 33.9  of the sunlight that hits it to electricity  more than double the previous high-end conversion rate  major projects on
or solar fuels are also under way in many developed nations 
space-based solar power  
satellites seek to overcome the problems of storage and provide civilization-scale power that is clean  constant  and global 
and
have active national programs aimed at commercial scale   and both nation s hope to orbit demonstrations in the 2030s  the china academy of space technology  cast  won the 2015 international
with this
of their   proponents of sbsp
that space-based solar power would be   and could scale to meet all planetary energy demand  a recent multi-agency industry
 echoing the 2008 pentagon recommendation  won the secdef secstate usaid director d3  diplomacy  development  defense  innovation challenge
with the following
and   northrop grumman is funding caltech with  17.5 million for an ultra lightweight design  keith henson recently posted a

wind  
main articles 
and
the
projects that the levelized cost of wind power in the u s  will decline about 25  from 2012 to 2030 
in the  
wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when
developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds  today  both
and
have programs dedicated to wind research  sandias laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials  aerodynamics  and sensors  the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production  reducing their capital costs  and making wind energy more cost effective overall  the field laboratory for optimized wind energy  flowe  at
was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost  size  and environmental impact of wind energy production  the president of sky windpower corporation thinks that wind turbines will be able to produce electricity at a cent kwh at an average which in comparison to coal-generated electricity is a fractional of the cost 
a wind farm is a group of
in the same location used to produce electric power  a large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines  and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles  but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes  a wind farm may also be located offshore 
many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the usa and china  the
in china has over 5,000 mw installed with a goal of 20,000 mw by 2020  china has several other  wind power bases  of similar size  the
in california is the largest onshore wind farm outside of china  with a capacity of 1020
of power  europe leads in the use of wind power with almost 66 gw  about 66 percent of the total globally  with denmark in the lead according to the countries installed per-capita capacity  as of february 2012  the
in united kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 mw  followed by
 300 mw   also in the uk 
there are many large wind farms under construction and these include
 400 mw  
 350 mw  
 500 mw  
 270 mw  
 1000 mw  
 343 mw  
 420 mw  
 845 mw   and
 317 mw  
wind power has expanded quickly  its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1  
carbon-neutral and negative fuels  
main articles 
and
carbon-neutral fuels are
 including      
or   produced by
waste
recycled from   recovered from automotive   or derived from
in   commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce synthetic fuels for less than
fuels when oil costs more than  55 per barrel  renewable methanol  rm  is a fuel produced from
and carbon dioxide by catalytic
where the hydrogen has been obtained from   it can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock 
the
plant operated by
in  
has been producing 2 million liters of
transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the
since 2011  it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year  a 250 kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the center for solar energy and hydrogen research  zsw  at
and the
in germany and began operating in 2010  it is being upgraded to 10 megawatts  scheduled for completion in autumn  2012 
has constructed a carbon-neutral
 lng  plant in   germany  the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their
automobiles  and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity  other commercial developments are taking place in     and   england

carbon related
such fuels are considered
because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric   to the extent that synthetic fuels displace   or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid  and their combustion is subject to
at the flue or exhaust pipe  they result in
and net
from the atmosphere  and thus constitute a form of  
such renewable fuels alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the
or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels  enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles  carbon-neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy   alleviating the problems of wind and solar   and they enable distribution of wind  water  and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines 
nighttime
is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the
for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  so  the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative  germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts 
biomass  
main articles 
and
to produce
in brazil
a
using wood to provide electricity to over 30.000 households in france
biomass is
derived from living  or recently living organisms  it most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called   as an energy source  biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat  or indirectly after converting it to various forms of   conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into  thermal  chemical  and biochemical methods  wood remains the largest biomass energy source today  examples include forest residues  such as dead trees  branches and
  yard clippings  wood chips and even   in the second sense  biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial   including   industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants  including                   and a variety of tree species  ranging from
to
   
biomass  biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat power and in doing so harm the environment  pollutants such as sulphurous oxides  sox   nitrous oxides  nox   and particulate matter  pm  are produced from this combustion  the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution  biomass combustion is a major contributor 
ethanol biofuels  
main article 
as the primary source of biofuel in north america  many organizations are conducting research in the area of
production  on the federal level  the
conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the united states  much of this research is targeted towards the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets  the
has conducted various ethanol research projects  mainly in the area of  
has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol  it does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood  grasses  or non-edible parts of plants  moreover  some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol  even if we used all the corn crop that we have in the united states and converted it into ethanol it would only produce enough fuel to serve 13 percent of the united states total gasoline consumption  conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research and is also a member of the
 jbei   a research institute founded by the
with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels 
other biofuels  
main article 
from 1978 to 1996  the
experimented with producing
in the     a self-published article by michael briggs  at the
biofuels group  offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all motor vehicle fuel with biofuels by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50   which briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants  this oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels  with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol  the production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale  but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate  during the biofuel production process algae actually consumes the carbon dioxide in the air and turns it into oxygen through photosynthesis  in addition to its projected high yield  algaculture unlike food crop-based biofuels  does not entail a decrease in food production  since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water  many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes  including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels 
several groups in various sectors are conducting research on   a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil  much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of jatropha through advancements in genetics  soil science  and horticultural practices    a san diego-based jatropha developer  has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds of jatropha that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties  the
 cfsef  is a los angeles-based non-profit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science  agronomy  and horticulture  successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300  in the next ten years 
geothermal  
main article 
is produced by tapping into the thermal energy created and stored within the earth  it arises from the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium and other elements found in the earth s crust  geothermal energy can be obtained by drilling into the ground  very similar to oil exploration  and then it is carried by a heat-transfer fluid  e g  water  brine or steam   geothermal systems that are mainly dominated by water have the potential to provide greater benefits to the system and will generate more power  within these liquid-dominated systems  there are possible concerns of subsidence and contamination of ground-water resources  therefore  protection of ground-water resources is necessary in these systems  this means that careful reservoir production and engineering is necessary in liquid-dominated geothermal reservoir systems  geothermal energy is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished  however  the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability  several entities  such as the
and
are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy  the international centre for geothermal research  igc   a german geosciences research organization  is largely focused on geothermal energy development research 
hydrogen  
main article 
over  1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen and a medium for energy storage in the united states  both the
and
have departments dedicated to hydrogen research  hydrogen is useful for energy storage and for use in airplanes  but is not practical for automobile use  as it is not very efficient  compared to using a battery  for the same cost a person can travel three times as far using a battery 
thorium  
main article 
there are potentially two sources of nuclear power 
is used in all current nuclear power plants 
is the reaction that exists in stars  including the sun  and remains impractical for use on earth  as fusion reactors are not yet available  however nuclear power is controversial politically and scientifically due to concerns about   safety  the risks of a severe accident  and technical and economical problems in dismantling of old power plants 
is a fissionable material used in   the thorium fuel cycle claims several potential advantages over a   including   superior physical and nuclear properties  better resistance to
and reduced
and
production  therefore  it is sometimes referred as sustainable 
clean energy investments  
2010 was a record year for green energy investments  according to a report from   nearly us  243 billion was invested in wind farms  solar power  electric cars  and other alternative technologies worldwide  representing a 30 percent increase from 2009 and nearly five times the money invested in 2004  china had  51.1 billion investment in clean energy projects in 2010  by far the largest figure for any country 
within emerging economies  brazil comes second to china in terms of clean energy investments  supported by strong energy policies  brazil has one of the worlds highest biomass and small-hydro power capacities and is poised for significant growth in wind energy investment  the cumulative investment potential in brazil from 2010 to 2020 is projected as  67 billion 
india is another rising clean energy leader  while india ranked the 10th in private clean energy investments among g-20 members in 2009  over the next 10 years it is expected to rise to the third position  with annual clean energy investment under current policies forecast to grow by 369 percent between 2010 and 2020 
it is clear that the center of growth has started to shift to the developing economies and they may lead the world in the new wave of clean energy investments 
around the world many sub-national governments - regions  states and provinces - have aggressively pursued sustainable energy investments  in the united states  california s leadership in renewable energy was recognised by the climate group when it awarded former governor arnold schwarzenegger its inaugural award for international climate leadership in copenhagen in 2009  in australia  the state of south australia - under the leadership of former premier mike rann - has led the way with wind power comprising 26  of its electricity generation by the end of 2011  edging out coal fired generation for the first time  south australia also has had the highest take-up per capita of household solar panels in australia following the rann government s introduction of solar feed-in laws and educative campaign involving the installation of solar photovoltaic installations on the roofs of prominent public buildings  including the parliament  museum  airport and adelaide showgrounds pavilion and schools  rann  australia s first climate change minister  passed legislation in 2006 setting targets for renewable energy and emissions cuts  the first legislation in australia to do so 
also  in the european union there is a clear trend of promoting policies encouraging investments and financing for sustainable energy in terms of energy efficiency  innovation in energy exploitation and development of renewable resources  with increased consideration of environmental aspects and sustainability
