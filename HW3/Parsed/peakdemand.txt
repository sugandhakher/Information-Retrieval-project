peak load  
peak demand  peak load or on-peak are terms used in
describing a period in which
is expected to be provided for a sustained period at a significantly higher than average supply level  peak demand fluctuations may occur on daily  monthly  seasonal and yearly cycles  for an
company  the actual point of peak demand is a single half-hour or hourly period which represents the highest point of customer consumption of electricity  at this time there is a combination of office  domestic demand and at some times of the year  the fall of darkness 
some utilities will charge customers based on their individual peak demand  the highest demand during each month or even a single 15 to 30 minute period of highest use in the previous year may be used to calculate charges

the maximum demand dictates the size of generators  transmission lines  transformers and circuit breakers for utilities even if that amount lasts just one hour per year  natural gas fueled power generators must all have adequately sized pipelines  power generation which is able to be rapidly ramped up for peak demand often uses more expensive fuels  is less efficient and has higher marginal carbon emissions 
peak demand may exceed the maximum supply levels that the
can   resulting in
and   this often occurs during
when use of air conditioners and powered fans raises the rate of
significantly  during a shortage authorities may request the public to curtail their energy use and shift it to a non-peak period

power stations  
providing power to
for peak demand are called
or  peakers  
fueled power stations can be fired up rapidly and are therefore often utilized at peak demand times 
type dams such as
help to meet peak demand as well 
the chances that a
will be unable to meet peak demand are greater than for a fossil-fueled power station  due to the ability to store liquid fuels for use during peak demand
