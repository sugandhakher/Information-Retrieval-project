the gansu wind farm project  also called jiuquan wind power base  is a group of large
under the construction in western
in
       the gansu wind farm project is located in desert areas near the city of
in two localities of
and also near   in the northwest province of   which has an abundance of wind resources 
the 8 gw of initial planned capacity of this wind farm is similar to that of the
in japan  which was the largest nuclear power plant in the world until its closure in 2012 
when fully completed the entire project may become the world s biggest collective windfarm

overview  
a small part of the huge guazhou wind turbine farm
the project is one of six national
megaprojects approved by the   it is expected to grow to 20,000
by 2020  at an estimated cost of 120 billion chinese yuan   17.5 billion   the project is being built by more than 20 developers in two localities in
and also near  
construction phases  
a wind turbine in the wind farm
gansu wind farm
the project is divided to multiple phases  the first 3,800 mw phase consisted of eighteen 200 mw wind farms and two 100 mw wind farms  the second 8,000 mw phase consists of forty 200 mw wind farms  the planned capacity is 5,160 mw by 2010  12,710 mw by 2015 and 20,000 mw in 2020 
in 2008  construction began on a 750 kv ac power line to carry electricity from the wind farm  and construction of the wind farms themselves started in august 2009  power is being purchased for 0.54 yuan per kwh  even though electricity from coal fired powerplants would be about half that price  since operations began  some 6.26 billion kwh has been generated as of october 31  2011 with 5.96 billion kwh of that produced in 2011 
in november 2010 officials announced the completion of the project s first phase  involving the installation of over 3,500 wind turbines with an installed capacity of approximately 5,160 mw according to wang jianxin  director of the jiuquan development and reform commission  total installed capacity rose to approximately 6,000 mw in march 2012roughly equivalent to the united kingdom s entire wind power capacity at that timewith new wind turbines being erected at the rate of 36 per day   
coordinated control centre  
on march 1  2012  a  wind power coordinated control system  was implemented to adjust the output of the 18 wind farms of the gansu wind farm project  which total 10 million kw  to meet the needs of the transmission grid  which is limited to 1.5 million kw  this permitted the production of 1 million kwh more per day than previously  and greatly improves the system s stability 
curtailment of wind turbine operations is a first order method for dealing with the intermittency of wind  but normally loses available output when the power grid s transmission capacity has been reached  other methods involve either added local industrial usage or added local storage capacity
