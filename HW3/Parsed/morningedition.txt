morning edition is an american
news program produced and distributed by   it airs weekday mornings  monday through friday  and runs for two hours  and many stations repeat one or both hours  the show feeds live from 05 00 to 09 00   with feeds and updates as required until noon  the show premiered on november 5  1979  its weekend counterpart is   morning edition and
are among the  
contents
background  
a typical show includes   both newscasts and in-depth reports  features on science  arts  business  sports  and politics  interviews with and profiles of people in the news  commentaries  and
features  some regional
networks and local stations also produce locally focused content under their morning edition banner 
  previously a co-host of   hosted morning edition beginning with its first episode  a job he initially took on a temporary basis when a shake-up in production and on-air staff occurred ten days before the show s premiere  edwards was joined by barbara hoctor  then of weekend all things considered  hoctor departed after four months  leaving edwards as solo host for the next quarter-century  his last day as host was april 30  2004  this was not due to edwards retiring  but rather a highly controversial decision from npr to reassign him as senior correspondent  which resulted in anger and harsh criticism from many listeners  since may 3  2004  the show has been co-hosted by
and   david greene joined as co-host in 2012  inskeep reports from npr headquarters in
and montagne reports from the studios of npr west in   a suburb of  
ratings show that over twelve million people listen to morning edition weekly  it s the second   after   though some sources  among them   sometimes place the show third in audience rankings behind limbaugh and   depending on the time  as of 2015  hannity has fallen behind morning edition in the talkers estimate  
in 1999  morning edition with bob edwards received the george foster  
format  
the following describes the program format effective november 17  2014 
morning edition begins each hour with a sixty-second  billboard  highlighting stories to be covered in the hour  at least one birthday or anniversary of a major event is announced as well  some stations replace this billboard with a localized version  with a similar format  but with emphasis on local stories and read by a local announcer 
the standard npr newscast follows for five minutes  many stations cut into the newscast at 04 past the hour to deliver additional news programming  a sixty-second music bed follows allowing stations additional time to deliver news  weather  or funding credits  after that  the signature thirty-second  bleeble   music bed  begins the program 
the first segment   a   highlights the most important stories of the day  usually the  a  segments differ between hours  although when the topic is extraordinary  the  a  segment will cover the same topic  but in a different format between the first and second hour  between each segment  one- to three-minute breaks occur which are filled with promotions for other programs  sponsorship credits  and station-provided content such as local traffic and weather reports  segment a ends at eighteen minutes past the hour  and a sixty-second break follows  new to morning edition effective november 17  2014 is a 89-second newscast at 19 and 42 past the hour  the mid-hour newscasts emphasize live news  including question and answer with correspondents  as opposed to headlines  following each mid-hour newscast is a 90-second break to allow stations to provide local news and information 
returning from the break at 22 30 past the hour  the second segment  or  b  segment  generally contains features  commentaries  or long form interviews  interviews can sometimes take up the entire segment  segment  b  ends at 30 00 past the hour  at which point a promotion for
and a humorous news item is delivered  these segments are called  returns   because many stations that air local news or announcements return to the national feed at half past the hour  the return lasts thirty seconds  and ends with the tagline  it s morning edition  from npr news   or some variation thereon 
at 31 00 past the hour a two-minute music bed is played which most stations cover with news updates or  modules  from other independent radio producers  the  c  segment follows at 33 35  duration 7 24  and is sometimes covered by stations with local reports as well  this segment features news or cultural reports  generally running the segment length  segment c ends with a mid-hour newscast and station break 
at 45 35 past the hour  the  d  segment  duration 4 00  is typically composed of two to three stories focusing on health news  international events  or short updates on national stories  at 49 35 past the hour the segment ends  and another two-minute station break begins 
the  e  segment begins at 51 30  duration 7 29  and differs between hours  originally in the first hour  the  e  segment was dedicated to stories and features from the world of business  while in the second hour  segment  e  included a cultural feature  remembrance  or softer news story  usually taking the entire segment length  beginning in november 2014  morning edition moved the second hour  e  features to the first hour  e  segment  dropping the dedicated business segment to allow npr stations to insert broadcasts of the   which is separately produced and distributed by npr rival
 prior to this change  many stations would already cover one or both  e  segments with marketplace morning report   however  some stations continue to air marketplace morning report in place of the  e  segment for the first hour  segment  e  ends at 59 00 after the hour  and leads into a music bed that takes the listener into the next hour  or the end of the program  depending on the hour and the station s program schedule 
stations receive over their computers the daily rundown of stories before each program which allows them to plan their coverage and decide what stories they wish to replace with local content  the rundown is updated as necessary until the feed ends at noon eastern time 
differences in pickup times  
most stations in the central and eastern time zones run morning edition live from 05 00 to 09 00   repeating one or both hours through morning drive time  some stations run only the two hours  others run up to seven hours  the repeats are automatically fed through the npr satellite  and are updated as necessary by npr anchors in the studio when breaking news events occur  in the past  edwards would stay at his npr office until the program feeds ended at noon in case there was anything that required an update  today  with two hosts  one host generally stays in the studio while the other does field reporting or works on stories for future shows  and the transition is seamless  unless both hosts have to be away from the studio for some reason  in that instance  substitute npr anchors
and
host the re-feeds 
on the   morning edition can run for up to seven hours running from the first live feed with the subsequent re-feeds  for example 
in
carries morning edition  from 02 00 to 09 00   kpcc handles the re-feeds uniquely  instead of taking the re-feed from the satellite  they  roll their own  by taking the tape from the feed two hours prior  so that they can run the a and b segments of morning edition about three minutes earlier than rival
in   which takes the re-feed direct from the satellite  in the event of a breaking news story  kpcc runs the same feed as kcrw 
in
carries morning edition from 03 00 to 09 00 local time  but only uses local announcers  news updates features and traffic weather reports starting with the 05 00 hour 
satellite radio  
morning edition  as well as its afternoon counterpart all things considered  is not carried on any of the public radio channels of   the leading us consumer satellite radio provider  this is reportedly to reduce direct competition between sirius xm and npr s local member stations  almost all of whom heavily use these flagship news programs to generate pledge revenue from listeners    a daytime interview show hosted by journalist   with a focus on african-american issues  is featured on npr now  channel 122  and   a competing news and interview program hosted by
and distributed by   is featured on siriusxm public radio  channel 205
