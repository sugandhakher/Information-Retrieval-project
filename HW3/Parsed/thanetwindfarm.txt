the thanet wind farm  also sometimes called thanet offshore wind farm  is an
7 miles  11km  off the coast of
district in     it is the world s third largest offshore wind farm  as of june 2013  the largest being the   followed by   it has a
 maximum output  of 300 and it cost 780900million  us 1.21.4billion   thanet is one of fifteen round2 wind projects announced by the
in january 2004 but the first to be developed  it was officially opened on 23september 2010  when it overtook
as the biggest offshore wind farm in the world  it has since been overtaken by walney

description  
the project covers an area of 13.5 square miles  35km2   with 500 metres  1,600ft  between turbines and 800 metres  2,600ft  between the rows  average water depth is 1423 metres  4675ft   planning permission for the project was granted on 18december 2006  according to thanet offshore wind ltd  it was expected to be  the largest operational offshore wind farm in the world   the thanet project has a total capacity of 300mw which  by yearly average  is sufficient to supply approximately 240,000 homes  it has an estimated generation of 960gwh per year of electricity  which means a
of 36.5  and an average
of 3.1 w m 
in 2011  the yearly production achieved was 823.88gwh which means a load factor of 31.35  
two
 by italy-based
group  run from an offshore
within the wind farm connecting to an existing onshore substation in   kent  connecting to a world-first two transformers  the offshore substation steps up the turbine voltage of 33kv to 132kv for the grid  maintenance of the turbines is carried out by   while a separate maintenance agreement with slp energy covers the turbines foundations  turbines are installed by the
offshore wind farm services provider   the
carried and installed the turbines 
financial structure  
the thanet scheme is   thanet offshore wind ltd  tow   the
was owned by
christofferson  robb   co  it was purchased from a group of sponsors led by warwick energy ltd  in august 2008 christofferson  robb   co placed the project back on the market  on 10november 2008    a swedish energy company  acquired tow 
current status  
the development was due to be in place by 2008  vestas were chosen as the preferred turbine supplier in july 2006  and slp were chosen as preferred supplier for the foundations in september 2006  the project was delayed by a number of issues including problems with vestas who temporarily withdrew their v90 offshore model from the market in 2007 following
problems  the
was re-released for sales starting from may 2008 
vattenfall acquired the project in november 2008  on 28 june 2010  they reported that all turbines had been installed for commissioning due by the end of 2010  the wind farm was completed in september 2010

criticism  
since turbine construction makes up the majority of the project cost and the uk has no capacity  much of the work was contracted to foreign companies  resulting in only 20  of the investment going to british firms  there have been calls for the creation of a domestic wind industry 
an article by
and
supporter
estimates that due to the wind being intermittent  thanet wind farm will only produce 75mw on average  the owners will receive a subsidy of 60m per year on top of the 3040m cost of the electricity due to   and based on the estimated working life of the turbines of 20 years  the total subsidy will come to 1.2 billion  since there are only 21 permanent   the subsidy per job comes to around 3m per year  however  booker used a generic capacity of 25   lower than vattenfall s estimate for thanet of 3540  capacity  105120 mw   the working life figure is also lower than other estimates of 40 years 
extension  
in june 2010  the crown estate announced that thanet wind farm could be extended to produce an additional 147 mw  however  in october 2010  vattenfall stated that it would not proceed
