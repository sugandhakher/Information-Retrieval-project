charity that works to eradicate fuel poverty and campaigns for greater investment in
to help those who are poor or vulnerable gain affordable heat

the definition of affordable warmth in
is where a household can achieve temperatures needed to maintain health and comfort for expenditure of less than 10  of income  this definition has been accepted and used by successive government departments with responsibilities for fuel poverty issues to quantify the extent of the problem  however  there has been some disagreement over what constitutes household income and this clearly has considerable bearing on the total number of fuel-poor households  the governments preferred definition of household income includes housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest in the calculation of household resources  although fuel poverty estimates are also published using a formula that excludes housing subsidies 
neas view is that neither of these definitions is acceptable or rational and that the only sensible definition of income is one that uses actual disposable income after housing costs 
results from a combination of low household income  unaffordable energy costs and inadequate thermal insulation and inefficient and uneconomic heating systems  welfare benefit increases for vulnerable groups  and other initiatives such as the minimum wage  have addressed some aspects of general poverty and fuel poverty  this approach must be considered short term in the context of fuel poverty  nea maintains that energy efficiency is the only rational solution to fuel poverty and that government should direct
