agricultural wastewater treatment is a farm management agenda for controlling pollution from surface runoff that may be contaminated by chemicals in fertiliser  pesticides  animal slurry  crop residues or irrigation water 
contents
nonpoint source pollution  
from farms is caused by
from fields during rain storms  agricultural runoff is a major source of   in some cases the only source  in many  
sediment runoff  
highly erodible soils on a farm in
washed off fields is the largest source of agricultural pollution in the united states  excess sediment causes high levels of

and smother animal

nutrient runoff

and
are key pollutants found in runoff  and they are applied to farmland in several ways  such as in the form of commercial   animal   or municipal or industrial wastewater  effluent  or sludge  these chemicals may also enter runoff from  
water    and   p  29
farmers can develop and implement
plans to mitigate impacts on water quality by 
mapping and documenting fields  crop types    water bodies
developing realistic
projections
conducting
and nutrient analyses of manures and or sludges applied
identifying other significant nutrient sources  e g   irrigation water 
evaluating significant field features such as highly erodible soils  subsurface drains  and shallow aquifers
applying fertilizers  manures  and or sludges based on realistic yield goals and using
techniques  pp  4-374-38
pesticides  
 crop dusting  of

field in the u s 
are widely used by farmers to control plant
and enhance   but chemical pesticides can also cause
problems  pesticides may appear in
due to 
direct application  e g  aerial spraying or
over water bodies 
runoff during rain storms
aerial drift  from adjacent fields   p 222
some pesticides have also been detected in   p 224
farmers may use
 ipm  techniques  which can include   to maintain control over pests  reduce reliance on chemical pesticides  and protect water quality 
there are few safe ways of disposing of pesticide surpluses other than through containment in well managed landfills or by   in some parts of the world  spraying on land is a permitted method of disposal   
point source pollution  
farms with large
and
operations  such as   can be a major source of
wastewater  in the united states  these facilities are called concentrated animal feeding operations or confined animal feeding operations and are being subject to increasing government  
animal wastes  
confined animal feeding operation in the
the constituents of animal wastewater typically contain
strong organic content  much stronger than human sewage
high
concentration
high
and phosphorus content
synthetic
often high concentrations of
and their eggs
spores of
 a protozoan  resistant to drinking water treatment processes
spores of
human pathogenic
such as
and
animal wastes from cattle can be produced as solid or semisolid manure or as a liquid   the production of slurry is especially common in housed dairy cattle 
treatment
whilst solid manure heaps outdoors can give rise to polluting wastewaters from runoff  this type of waste is usually relatively easy to treat by containment and or covering of the heap 
animal slurries require special handling and are usually treated by containment in lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland 
are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes  as are   excessive application or application to sodden land or insufficient land area can result in direct runoff to watercourses  with the potential for causing severe   application of slurries to land overlying
can result in direct contamination or  more commonly  elevation of nitrogen levels as
or nitrate 
the disposal of any wastewater containing animal waste upstream of a drinking water intake can pose serious health problems to those drinking the water because of the highly resistant spores present in many animals that are capable of causing disabling disease in humans  this risk exists even for very low-level seepage via shallow surface drains or from rainfall run-off 
some animal slurries are treated by mixing with straws and
at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement 
piggery waste  
confinement barn or
piggery waste is comparable to other animal wastes and is processed as for general animal waste  except that many piggery wastes contain elevated levels of
that can be toxic in the natural environment  the liquid fraction of the waste is frequently separated off and re-used in the piggery to avoid the prohibitively expensive costs of disposing of copper-rich liquid 
worms and their eggs are also common in piggery waste and can infect humans if wastewater treatment is ineffective 
silage liquor  
fresh or wilted
or other green crops can be made into a semi- product called
which can be stored and used as winter forage for cattle and sheep  the production of silage often involves the use of an acid conditioner such as
or   the process of silage making frequently produces a yellow-brown strongly smelling liquid which is very rich in simple     short-chain organic acids and silage conditioner  this liquor is one of the most polluting organic substances known  the volume of silage liquor produced is generally in proportion to the moisture content of the ensiled material 
treatment
silage liquor is best treated through prevention by wilting crops well before silage making  any silage liquor that is produced can be used as part of the food for pigs  the most effective treatment is by containment in a slurry lagoon and by subsequent spreading on land following substantial dilution with slurry  containment of silage liquor on its own can cause structural problems in concrete pits because of the acidic nature of silage liquor 
milking parlour  dairy farming  wastes  
although milk has a deserved reputation as an important and valuable food product  its presence in wastewaters is highly polluting because of its organic strength  which can lead to very rapid
of receiving waters 
wastes also contain large volumes of wash-down water  some animal waste together with cleaning and
chemicals 
treatment
milking parlour wastes are often treated in
with human sewage in a local
plant  this ensures that disinfectants and cleaning agents are sufficiently diluted and amenable to treatment  running milking wastewaters into a farm slurry lagoon is a possible option although this tends to consume lagoon capacity very quickly  land spreading is also a treatment option  see also  
slaughtering waste  
wastewater from slaughtering activities is similar to milking parlour waste  see above  although considerably stronger in its organic composition and therefore potentially much more polluting 
treatment
as for milking parlour waste  see above  
vegetable washing water  
washing of
produces large volumes of water contaminated by soil and vegetable pieces  low levels of pesticides used to treat the vegetables may also be present together with moderate levels of disinfectants such as  
treatment
most vegetable washing waters are extensively recycled with the solids removed by settlement and filtration  the recovered soil can be returned to the land 
firewater  
although few farms plan for fires  fires are nevertheless more common on farms than on many other industrial premises  stores of pesticides  herbicides  fuel oil for farm machinery and fertilizers can all help promote fire and can all be present in environmentally lethal quantities in
from
at farms 
treatment
all farm environmental management plans should allow for containment of substantial quantities of firewater and for its subsequent recovery and disposal by specialist disposal companies  the concentration and mixture of contaminants in firewater make them unsuited to any treatment method available on the farm  even land spreading has produced severe taste and odour problems for downstream water supply companies in the past
