load management  also known as demand side management  dsm   is the process of
on the network with the electrical load by adjusting or controlling the load rather than the power station output  this can be achieved by direct intervention of the utility in real time  by the use of frequency sensitive relays triggering the circuit breakers  ripple control   by time clocks  or by using special tariffs to influence consumer behavior  load management allows utilities to reduce demand for electricity during peak usage times   peak shaving    which can  in turn  reduce costs by eliminating the need for   in addition  some peaking power plants can take more than an hour to bring on-line which makes load management even more critical should a plant go off-line unexpectedly for example  load management can also help reduce harmful emissions  since peaking plants or backup generators are often dirtier and less efficient than   new load-management technologies are constantly under development  both by private industry and public entities

brief history  
in 1972    while working for
in   developed a sensor monitoring system which used digital transmission for security  fire  and medical alarm systems as well as meter-reading capabilities for all utilities  this technology was a spin-off of his patented automatic telephone line identification system  now known as   in  1974  paraskevakos was awarded a u s  patent for this technology 
at the request of the   paraskevakos developed a load-management system along with automatic meter-reading technology  in doing so  he utilized the ability of the system to monitor the speed of the watt power meter disc and  consequently  power consumption  this information  along with the time of day  gave the power company the ability to instruct individual meters to manage water heater and air conditioning consumption in order to prevent peaks in usage during the high consumption portions of the day  for this approach  paraskevakos was awarded multiple patents 
advantages and operating principles  
since electrical energy is a form of
that cannot be effectively stored in bulk  it must be generated  distributed  and consumed immediately  when the load on a system approaches the maximum generating capacity  network operators must either find additional supplies of energy or find ways to curtail the load  hence load management  if they are unsuccessful  the system will become unstable and
can occur 
long-term load management planning may begin by building sophisticated models to describe the physical properties of the distribution network  i e  topology  capacity  and other characteristics of the lines   as well as the load behavior  the analysis may include scenarios that account for weather forecasts  the predicted impact of proposed load-shed commands  estimated time-to-repair for off-line equipment  and other factors 
the utilization of load management can help a power plant achieve a higher   a measure of average capacity utilization  capacity factor is a measure of the output of a power plant compared to the maximum output it could produce  capacity factor is often defined as the ratio of average load to capacity or the ratio of average load to peak load in a period of time  a higher load factor is advantageous because a power plant may be less efficient at low load factors  a high load factor means fixed costs are spread over more kwh of output  resulting in a lower price per unit of electricity   and a higher load factor means greater total output  if the power load factor is affected by non-availability of fuel  maintenance shut-down  unplanned breakdown  or reduced demand  as consumption pattern fluctuate throughout the day   the generation has to be adjusted  since
is often prohibitively expensive 
smaller utilities that buy power instead of generating their own find that they can also benefit by installing a load control system  the penalties they must pay to the energy provider for peak usage can be significantly reduced  many report that a load control system can pay for itself in a single season 
comparisons to demand response  
when the decision is made to curtail load  it is done so on the basis of system reliability  the utility in a sense  owns the switch  and sheds loads only when the stability or reliability of the electrical distribution system is threatened  the utility  being in the business of generating  transporting  and delivering electricity  will not disrupt their business process without due cause  load management  when done properly  is non-invasive  and imposes no hardship on the consumer  the load should be shifted to off peak hours 
places the  on-off switch  in the hands of the consumer using devices such as a
controlled   while many residential consumers pay a flat rate for electricity year-round  the utility s costs actually vary constantly  depending on demand  the distribution network  and composition of the company s electricity generation portfolio  in a free market  the wholesale price of energy varies widely throughout the day  demand response programs such as those enabled by smart grids attempt to incentivize the consumer to limit usage based upon cost concerns  as costs rise during the day  as the system reaches peak capacity and more expensive peaking power plants are used   a free
should allow the price to rise  a corresponding drop in demand for the commodity should meet a fall in price  while this works for predictable shortages  many crises develop within seconds due to unforeseen equipment failures  they must be resolved in the same time-frame in order to avoid a   many utilities who are interested in demand response have also expressed an interest in load control capability so that they might be able to operate the  on-off switch  before price updates could be published to the consumers 
the application of load control technology continues to grow today with the sale of both
and
based systems  certain types of
systems can also serve as load control systems 
the largest residential load control system in the world is found in florida and is managed by   it utilizes 800,000 load control transponders  lcts  and controls 1,000 mw of electrical power  2,000 mw in an emergency   fpl has been able to avoid the construction of numerous new power plants due to their load management programs 
ripple control  
ripple control is the most common form of load control  and is used in many countries around the world  including     the     the   and   ripple control involves superimposing a higher-frequency signal  usually between 100 and 1600hz  onto the standard 5060hz of the main power signal  when receiver devices attached to non-essential residential or industrial loads receive this signal  they shut down the load until the signal is disabled or another frequency signal is received 
early implementations of ripple control occurred during
in various parts of the world using a system that communicates over the electrical distribution system  ripple control systems are generally paired with a two-  or more  tiered pricing system  whereby electricity is more expensive during peak times  evenings  and cheaper during low-usage times  early morning  
affected residential devices will vary by region  but may include residential electric hot-water heaters  air conditioners  pool pumps  or crop-irrigation pumps  in a distribution network outfitted with load control  these devices are outfitted with communicating controllers that can run a program that limits the duty cycle of the equipment under control  consumers are usually rewarded for participating in the load control program by paying a reduced rate for energy  proper load management by the utility allows them to practice
to avoid
and reduce costs 
examples of schemes  
in many countries  including  
and   the power grids routinely use privately held  emergency diesel generators in load management schemes
new zealand  
a ripple control receiver fitted to a new zealand house  the left circuit breaker controls the water storage heater supply  currently on   while the right one controls the nightstore heater supply  currently off  
since the 1950s  new zealand has had a system of load management based on ripple control  allowing the electricity supply for domestic and commercial water storage heaters to be switched off and on  as well as allowing remote control of nightstore heaters and street lights  ripple injection equipment located within each local distribution network signals to ripple control receivers at the customer s premises  control may either done manually by the local distribution network company in response to local outages or requests to reduce demand from the transmission system operator  i e     or automatically when injection equipment detects mains frequency falling below 49.2hz  ripple control receivers are assigned to one of several ripple channels to allow the network company to only turn off supply on part of the network  and to allow staged restoration of supply to reduce the impact of a surge in demand when power is restored to water heaters after a period of time off 
depending on the area  the consumer may have two electricity meters  one for normal supply   anytime   and one for the load-managed supply   controlled    with controlled supply billed at a lower rate per kilowatt-hour than anytime supply  for those with load-managed supply but only a single meter  electricity is billed at the  composite  rate  priced between anytime and controlled 
france  
france has an ejp tariff  which allows it to disconnect certain loads and to encourage consumers to disconnect certain loads  this tariff is no longer available for new clients  as of july 2009   the tempo tariff also includes different types of days with different prices  but has been discontinued for new clients as well  as of july 2009   reduced prices during nighttime are available for customers for a higher monthly fee

in the uk  night storage heaters are used to increase the load by about 5 gw to accommodate the nuclear programme  there is also a programme that allows industrial loads to be disconnected using circuit breakers triggered automatically by frequency sensitive relays fitted on site  this operates in conjunction with   a programme using diesel generators 
these can also be remotely switched using bbc radio 4 longwave
