in march 2009 at a meeting of the
2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now  no excuse  for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction targets  abrupt or irreversible  shifts in climate may occur that  will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with   management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the

and  in turn  the food supply of both humans and other organisms  scientists have warned of the possibility  under the influence of climate change  of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of
that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe  major human environmental impacts occur in the more habitable regions of the ocean fringes  the  
and   ten per cent of the world s population  about 600 million people  live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise  trends of concern that require management include 
 beyond sustainable levels  
due to ocean warming and
due to increasing levels of dissolved carbon dioxide  and
due to climate change  because of their vastness oceans also act as a convenient
for human waste  remedial strategies include  more careful waste management  statutory control of overfishing by adoption of
practices and the use of environmentally sensitive and sustainable
and   reduction of fossil fuel emissions and restoration of coastal and other marine habitat

land  
further information 
loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development  forestry and agriculture as
is progressively converted to man-made capital  land use change is fundamental to the operations of the
because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to        
and
have a marked effect on the global water  carbon and nitrogen
and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems  at the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from the pursuit of
and  
forests

since the neolithic revolution  human use has reduced the worlds forest cover by about 47   present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the worlds ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics in temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing  with the exception of siberia   but
in the tropics is of major concern 
forests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance    and   they also conserve   protect water quality  preserve soil and soil quality  provide fuel and   and purify the air  these free
are not given a market value under most current economic systems  and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of logging and clearance which  through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere  the united nations
 fao  estimates that about 90  of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50  more carbon than is present in the atmosphere  changes in land use currently contribute about 20  of total global carbon emissions  heavily logged indonesia and brazil are a major source of emissions  
can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in
schemes  plantations and timber products  also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable carbon-neutral fuel  the fao has suggested that  over the period 20052050  effective use of tree planting could absorb about 1020  of man-made emissions  so monitoring the condition of the world s forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services  however  climate change may pre-empt this fao scenario as a study by the
in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5c  4.5f  temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon so the potential of forests to act as carbon  sinks  is  at risk of being lost entirely  
cultivated land

a rice paddy  rice  wheat  corn and potatoes make up more than half the world s food supply
feeding more than six billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the earths resources  this begins with the appropriation of about 38  of the earths land surface and about 20  of its net primary productivity  added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness  everything from the crop need for irrigation water  synthetic

to the resource costs of food packaging

and conversion to desert from constant tillage of annual crops  overgrazing        high levels of
use  reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic   reductions in

of waterbodies by run-off and   social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of  
all of these environmental problems associated with

extinctions

the extinct

although
loss can be monitored simply as loss of species  effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems  following human migration and population growth  species
have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the   known as the
this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass   some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100  current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10  birds and mammals threatened  about 8  of plants  5  of fish and more than 20  of freshwater species 
the 2008
warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and  for example  lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction  which is one-in-eight of all bird species  the
also identifies 44 tree species in central asia as under threat of extinction due to
and human development and threatening the region s forests which are home to more than 300 wild ancestors of modern domesticated fruit and nut cultivars 
biological invasions

in many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity  after   has become the destructive effect of   increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of
across the planet  the potential danger of this aspect of
is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like
   
and   but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native   non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where  in the absence of their natural   they are able to thrive  at the global scale this issue is being addressed through the
but there is improved international
legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms  also  through
legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species  increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities  gardeners  the nursery industry  collectors  and the pet and aquarium industries  to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species 
resistance to change  
main article 
the environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve  the modern
has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways  but little progress has been made  as shown by severe
overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the
problem  something within the human system in preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior  that system trait is systemic change resistance  change resistance is also known as organizational resistance  barriers to change  or policy resistance
