the nellis solar power plant is a 14-  mw 
located within
in     northeast of   the power plant was inaugurated in a ceremony on december17  2007  with nevada governor
activating its full operation  on average  it has since generated 32gigawatt-hours of electricity annually and supplied more than 25  of the power used at the base 
occupying 140 acres  57ha  of land leased from the air force at the northeastern corner of the base  this ground-mounted solar system employs an advanced
system  designed and deployed by   the system contains approximately 70,000 solar panels  and the peak power generation capacity of the plant is approximately 13  this means the ratio of average to peak output  or   of this plant is around 22  
the energy generated will support more than 12,000 military and civilians at nellis who are responsible for air force advanced combat training  tactics development and operational testing  construction began on april23  2007  and operation of the first 5mw began on october 12  2007

economics  
under the terms of the   mma renewable ventures  who own the panels  is leasing the land at no cost and nellis is agreeing to buy the power for 20years at about 2.2cents kwh  instead of the 9cents they are paying to nevada power  saving the air force  1 million each year  none of the  100million cost came from the air force  but instead from subsidizing taxpayers and nevada power customers who are paying for the rps credits 
the partners were able to build the plant  recover costs and produce electricity at a savings  because of the fairly complex financing structure arranged among mma  its investors  nevada power  and nellis  in addition to multimillion-dollar government incentives 
the plant was expected to produce 30 gwh per year but actually produced about 32gwh the first year  8  more than expected  saving the air force  1.2 million in the first year of operation 
there is no provision for operation during a power failure  when the base reverts to generator power  this would require limiting the output to less than or equal to what the generators can provide  otherwise a cloud could pass over and cause the sudden drop in output to overload the generators  causing them to trip off  if a pumped-hydro facility was added in the nearby hills  that would allow the base to operate during power failures under solar power  although batteries would also be needed to allow time for the hydro-electric plant to adjust to the load requirements 
design  
nellis consists of 5,821 tilted axis  t20
made by sunpower  and uses 72,416   each 200 watts  and 54 xantrex  schneider electric  gt 250   each rated 250kw  the maximum output is therefore inverter limited to 13.5 megawatts  ac   at full output  the inverters are 96  efficient  approximately 10  of the panels are mounted on north-south oriented horizontal single axis trackers  about one third of the solar panels were made by suntech power  the lead supplier 
renewable portfolio standard  
a section of the nellis solar power plant
in 1999  nevada passed a
 rps  as part of their 1997 electric restructuring legislation  ab366   it required any electric providers in the state to acquire actual renewable electric generation or purchase renewable energy credits so that each utility had 1percent of total consumption in renewables  however  on june8  2001  nevada governor
signed sb372  at the time the country s most aggressive renewable portfolio standard  the law requires that 15percent of all electricity generated in nevada be derived from new renewables by the year 2013 
the 2001  revision to the rps keeps in place nevada s commitment to expand solar energy resources by requiring that at least 5percent of the renewable energy projects must generate electricity from solar energy 
in june 2005  the nevada legislature passed a bill during a special legislative session that modified the nevada rps  assembly bill 03   the bill extends the deadline and raised the requirements of the rps to 20percent of sales by 2015 
expansion  
an extension of the plant called nellis solar pv ii  which will generate another 15 megawatts of power  began construction on march 24  2015  and was completed in february 2016
