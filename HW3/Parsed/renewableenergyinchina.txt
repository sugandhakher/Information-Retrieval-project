sector is growing faster than its

capacity  in 2015 china became world s largest producer of   at 43 gw installed capacity  china also led the world in the production and use of
and
technologies  generating almost as much water  wind  and
as all of france and germany s power plants combined 
whilst china has the world s largest installations of solar and wind power its energy needs are so great that in 2013 renewables provided just a little over 20  of its power generation  with most of the remainder provided by traditional coal power facilities  nevertheless  the share of renewables in the energy mix had been gradually rising from 2013 and targets from 2015 onwards have represented a step change in ambition  the next few years will demonstrate whether these ambitious targets can be delivered  as of the end of 2015 the world leading countries in wind power by installations  although the usa generated slightly more wind power at 190 twh as of 186.3 twh in china  were  1

in 2013 china had a total capacity of 378
of renewable power  mainly from
and   china sees renewables as a source of
and not just only to reduce   chinas action plan for the prevention and control of air pollution issued by chinas state council in september 2013  illustrates the government s desire to increase the share of renewables in chinas   unlike oil  coal and gas  the supplies of which are finite and subject to geopolitical tensions  renewable energy systems can be built and used wherever there is sufficient water  wind  and sun 
since 2005  production of
in china has expanded 100-fold  as chinese renewable manufacturing has grown  the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped dramatically  innovation has helped  but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion

on april 6  2007  the gansu dang river hydropower project was registered as a clean development mechanism  cdm  project in accordance with the requirements of the
to the   the project consists of the construction and operation of eight
providing total capacity of 35.4 gw  which will generate an average of 224 gwh year  the project is located in dang town  subei mongolian autonomous county    china  and was certified by the
 ndrc  to be in compliance with the  measures for the operation and management of clean development mechanism projects in china   the power generated by the project will be sold to the gansu power grid which is part of the china northwest regional power grid  nwpg   this will displace equivalent amounts of electricity generated by the current mix of power sold to the nwpg  the developer of the gansu dang river hydropower project  which started construction on november 1  2004  is the jiayuguan city tongyuan hydropower co   ltd  the letter of approval of the ndrc permits the jiayuguan city tongyuan hydropower co   ltd  to transfer to japan carbon finance  ltd   an entity approved by the
no more than 1.2 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions in total
 cers  over the seven-year period beginning on may 1  2007  and ending on april 30  2014 
in 2006 there were 10 gw of installed hydropower capacity that went into operation in china  the national development and reform commission also approved thirteen additional hydropower projects in 2006  which cumulatively will have 19.5 gw of power generating capacity  new hydropower projects that were approved and began construction in 2006 include the
 6000mw   the
 second phase   4800mw   the  s
 1750mw   the  1040mw   and the

further information 
china has the largest wind resources in the world and three-quarters of this natural resource is located at sea  china aims to have 100 gw of wind power capacity by 2020  china encourages foreign companies  especially from the united states  to visit and invest in chinese wind power generation  however  use of wind energy in china has not always kept up with the remarkable construction of wind power capacity in the country 
as of 2010  china has become the world s largest maker of wind turbines  surpassing denmark  germany  spain  and the united states  the initial future target set by the chinese government was 10 gw by 2010  but the total installed capacity for wind power generation in china had already reached 25.1 gw by the end of 2009 
by 2009 china had total installed windpower capacity up to 26 gw  china has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country s economy 
in 2008 china was the fourth largest producer of wind power after the united states  germany  and spain  at the end of 2008  wind power in china accounted for 12.2 gw of electricity generating capacity  by the end of 2008  at least fifteen chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components  turbine sizes of 1.5mw and 2mw became common  leading wind power companies were     and   china also increased the production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines  80mw  in 2008  through all these developments  the chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the   according to industry observers

further information 
china produces 63  of the world s solar
 pv   it has emerged as the world s largest manufacturer as of june 2015 
following the new incentive scheme of golden sun announced by the government in 2009  there are numerous recent developments and plans announced by industry players that became part of the milestones for solar industry and technology development in china  such as the new thin film solar plant developed by
in the henan province using its own proprietary solar technology  the agreement was signed by ldk for a 500mw solar project in the desert  alongside first solar and ordos city  the effort to drive the renewable energy use in china was further assured after the speech of the chinese president given at the un climate summit on 22 september 2009 in new york  pledging that china would adopt plans to use 15  of its energy from renewable sources within a decade 
china has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology  with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over  15 billion  around 820mw of solar pv were produced in china in 2007  second only to japan

fuel consumption in china  in the 11th five year plan period  2006 through 2010  china planned to develop six megatons year of fuel ethanol capacity  which is expected to grow to 15 megatons year by 2020  despite this level of production  experts say that there will be no threat to food security  though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be  farming oil  if the price of
continues to increase  based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in china  the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for plants in these provinces  in the recently published   the
expressed concern that there would be increasing competition worldwide between bio-fuels and food consumption for agricultural products and that that competition would likely continue to result in increases in the price of crops 
work has begun on the 250 million kaiyou green energy biomass  rice husks  power generating project located in the
economic development zone in   the kaiyou green energy biomass power project will generate 144 gwh year and use 200 kilotons year of crop waste as inputs 
bioenergy is also used at the domestic level in china  both in

further information 
geothermal resources in china are abundant and widely distributed throughout the country  there are over 2,700 hot springs occurring at the surface  with temperatures exceeding 250c  in 1990  the total flow rate of thermal water for direct uses amounted to over 9,500kg s  making china the second direct user of geothermal energy in the world  recognizing geothermal energy as an alternative and renewable energy resource since the 1970s  china has conducted extensive explorations aiming at identifying high temperature resources for electric generation  until 2006  181 geothemal systems had been found on mainland china  with an estimated generation potential of 1,740mw  however  only seven plants  with a total capacity of 32mw  had been constructed and were operating in 2006 
national laws and policies  
further information 
after the dissolution of the energy and industry department in 1993  china has been running without a government agency effectively managing the country s energy  related issues are supervised by multiple organizations such as the national development and reform commission  ndrc   ministry of commerce  state electricity regulatory commission  serc  and so forth  in 2008  the national energy administration was founded under the ndrc  however its work has been proven inefficient  in january 2010  the state council decided to set up a national energy commission  nec   headed by current chinese premier wen jiabao  the commission will be responsible for drafting a national energy development plan  reviewing energy security and major energy issues and coordinating domestic energy development and international cooperation 
the chinese government is implementing multiple policies to promote renewable energy  from 2008 to january 2012  china held the top spot in clean energy investment  the renewable energy law passed in 2005 explicitly states in its first chapter that the development and the usage of renewable energy is a prioritized area in energy development  the   the current plan  also places great emphasis on green energy  detailed incentive policies and programs include the golden sun program  which provides financial subsidies  technology support and market incentives to facilitate the development of the solar power industry  the suggestions on promoting wind electricity industry in 2006  which offers preferential policies for wind power development  and many other policies  besides promoting policies  china has enacted a number of policies to standardize renewable energy products  to prevent environmental damage  and to regulate the price of green energy  these policies include  but are not limited to renewable energy law  the safety regulations of hydropower dams and the national standard of solar water heaters 
several provisions in relevant chinese laws and regulations address the development of
in rural china  these provisions include article 54 of the agriculture law of the people s republic of china  articles 4 and 11 of the
law of the people s republic of china  article 18 of the renewable energy law of the people s republic of china and article 12 of the regulations of the people s republic of china concerning restoring

cdm projects in china  
further information 
according to the unfccc database  by november 2011  china was the leading host nation for cdm projects with 1661 projects  46.32   of a total of 3586 registered project activities  100    according to the iges  japan   the running total of cers generated by cdm projects in china at 31 march 2011 was topped by hfc reduction avoidance projects  365,577 x 1000t co2-e  followed by hydro power  227,693   wind power  149,492   n2o decomposition  102,798   and methane recovery  102,067  
according to the   of a total of more than 600 registered cdm projects worldwide through mid-april 2007  there are now 70 registered cdm projects in china  the pace of chinese cdm project registration is accelerating  prior to the beginning of 2007 china had a total of 34 registered cdm projects  yet to date in 2007 another 36 chinese cdm projects have been registered 
the shanghai power transmission and distribution joint stock company  a subsidiary of the shanghai electric and gas group joint stock company entered into a joint venture agreement with canada s xantrex technology  inc  to build a factory to design  manufacture and sell solar and wind power electric and gas electronics products  the new company is in the final stages of the approval process 
according to theo ramborst  the general manager and ceo of

environmental protection and energy conservation  
according to china s  energy blue paper  recently written by the   the average rate of recovery of
from
in china is only 30   less than one-half the rate of recovery throughout the world  the rate of recovery of coal resources in the u s    
and
is  80   the rate of recovery of coal from mining in   china s largest source of coal is approximately 40   though the rate of recovery of village and township coal mines in shanxi province is only 10 -20   cumulatively over the course of the past 20 years  19802000  china has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal  the same causes for a low rate of recovery in coal miningthat extraction methods are backwardslead to safety problems in china s
sector  another reason for the low rate of recovery is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining  of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by china  only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines  based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current rate of recovery of 30   if china were able to double its rate of recovery it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal

and
in central and southeastern china  the weather events in china in 2006 were seen to be a prelude to weather patterns likely to become more common due to   topics discussed by representatives of asian countries and developed countries  international organizations and nongovernmental organizations  included vulnerability assessments  implementing adaptation actions in various sectors of the economy and in specific geographical areas  such as coastal and mountainous regions 
based on a recently completed survey in 2007  the
plans to further develop and improve standards for conservation and comprehensive utilization of natural resources in the following areas  energy  water  wood and land conservation  development of renewable energy  the comprehensive utilization of mineral resources  recovery 
and reuse of scrap materials and clean production 
energy production and consumption  
further information 
in 2011  china produced 70  of its energy from coal  emitted more carbon dioxide than the next two largest emitters combined  the u s a  and india  and emissions had been increasing by 10  a year 
in 2011  china produced 6  of its energy from hydroelectric   1  from nuclear  and 1  from other renewable energy sources 
chinese energy experts are estimating that by 2050 the percentage of china s energy requirements that are satisfied by coal-fired plants will have declined to 30-50  of total energy consumption and that the remaining 50-70  will be provided by a combination of     and
sources  including       solar energy  wind energy  and other renewable energy sources 
in 2007  transportation s share of crude oil consumption in china is approximately 35   but that by 2020 consumption of crude oil for transportation purposes will have increased to 50  of total crude oil consumption 
according to a study conducted by the energy research institute of the
on the economic circumstances of china s
and
as of 2007  in recent years china has wasted an average of 400 megatons of coal equivalents per year  in 2006  china consumed a total of 2.46 gigatons coal equivalents  up from 1.4 gigatons of coal equivalents consumed nationwide in 2000  with energy consumption increasing at the rate of 10  year  in the last 5 years total energy consumption has exceeded the combined amount of energy consumption over the previous 20 years  according to dai yande  the chairman of the energy research institute of the ndrc  while continued high consumption of energy is unavoidable  china must take steps to change the form of its
and increase substantially the
of chinese industry and society generally  among other things china should find new points of
that moves china away from being the  world s factory  and improves energy efficiency  china also must avoid unnecessary waste  foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy sources to reduce china s reliance on
energy resources 
since june 2006 when chinese premier
visited the  s
project and expressed that coal-to-liquids production was one important part of china s   there have been many new coal to oil  projects announced by many large coal producing provinces and cities  as of the end of 2006 there will 88
projects planned  the total capacity of these projects is 48.5 megatons year  if all of these projects are built  by 2010 output of methyl alcohol will reach 60 megatons year  this development rush to build coal to oil projects is giving rise to concerns about a new round of wasteful development and the
of such rapid development  these include wasteful extraction of coal  excessive use of water  this process requires 10 tons of water for every ton of oil produced   and likely increases in the price of coal 
china and
are in talks to link their electric power networks so that china can purchase power from the
to supply
    the benefits for china of importing power from neighboring countries include conserving domestic resources  lowering energy consumption  lessening china s dependence on imported oil  80 -90  of which must be shipped through unsafe waters  and reducing pollution discharge  china already has begun to build a 1 mv
and an 800 kv direct power transmission project and after 2010 china will have a long distance high tension  high capacity transmission line for international transmission of electric power  china also is considering connecting its power transmission lines with
and other
that border china and specialists predict that by the year 2020 more than 4 pwh of power will be transmitted into china from neighboring states  in that year china is expected to produce 250 megatons of crude oil and be required to import approximately 350 megatons of crude oil  a reliance on exports of 60   if china is able to import 620 twh of power from neighbors  it will be able to reduce crude oil imports by 100 megatons  by importing electric from four or five neighboring countries china will not only reduce its dependence on imported crude oil  but also will enhance energy security by diversifying its foreign energy sources  making china less vulnerable to disruptions in supply 
in 2006 a total of 2.8344 pwh of electricity was generated in china from an installed base of 622 gw of power generating capacity  in 2006 alone an additional 105 gw of installed capacity came on line in china  experts estimate that another 100 gw of newly installed
generating capacity will again come on-line in 2007  but that 2006 probably was the high-water mark for electric power capacity development in china
