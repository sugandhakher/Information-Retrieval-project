human impact
environment in
the ecosystem of public parks often includes humans feeding the wildlife 
human impact on the environment or anthropogenic impact on the environment includes impacts on     and other resources  the term anthropogenic designates an effect or object resulting from   the term was first used in the technical sense by russian geologist   and was first used in english by british ecologist
in reference to human influences on
plant communities  the atmospheric scientist
introduced the term    in the mid-1970s  the term is sometimes used in the context of
emissions that are produced as a result of human activities but applies broadly to all major human impacts on the environment

causes  
technology  
the applications of technology often result in unavoidable and unexpected environmental impacts  which according to the
equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit gdp  environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons  first  given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit  control  or otherwise improve upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution  any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences  second  the conservation of mass principle and the
 i e   conservation of energy  dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology  environmental consequences are inescapable  third  according to the   order can be increased within a system  such as the human economy  only by increasing disorder or
outside the system  i e   the environment   thus  technologies can create order in the human economy  i e   order as manifested in buildings  factories  transportation networks  communication systems  etc   only at the expense of increasing disorder in the environment  according to a number of studies  increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts 
agriculture  
main article 
the environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world  ultimately  the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers  the connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect  as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature 
there are two types of indicators of environmental impact   means-based   which is based on the farmer s production methods  and  effect-based   which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment  an example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater  that is effected by the amount of
to the soil  an indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based 
the environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil  to water  the air  animal and soil diversity  plants  and the food itself  some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change  deforestation  genetic engineering  irrigation problems  pollutants  soil degradation  and waste 
fishing  
main article 
 
the environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught  such as     and   and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment  such as
and destruction of habitat such as  
these conservation issues are part of   and are addressed in
programs  there is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanitys desire to catch them  a problem that gets worse as the
grows 
similar to other   there can be conflict between the
who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be
then some fisheries must reduce or even close 
the journal
published a four-year study in november 2006  which predicted that  at prevailing trends  the world would run out of wild-caught
in 2048  the scientists stated that the decline was a result of  
and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded  yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed  and many fishery management officials  industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings  although the debate continues  many countries  such as   the  
and   and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources 
irrigation  
main article 
the environmental impact of irrigation includes the changes in quantity and quality of
and
as a result of
and the ensuing effects on natural and social conditions at the tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme 
the impacts stem from the changed
owing to the installation and operation of the scheme 
an irrigation scheme often draws water from the river and distributes it over the irrigated area  as a hydrological result it is found that 
the downstream river
is reduced
the
in the scheme is increased
the
in the scheme is increased
the level of the
rises
the
flow is increased 
these may be called direct effects 
effects on soil and
are indirect and complex  and subsequent impacts on natural 
and
conditions are intricate  in some  but not all instances 
and
can result  however  irrigation can also be used  together with soil drainage  to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone 
irrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by   as a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends  the effects may be   land soil   and  along the coast   
irrigation projects can have large benefits  but the negative side effects are often overlooked  agricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps  dams  and pipelines are responsible for the large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers  lakes  and rivers  as a result of this massive diversion of freshwater  lakes  rivers  and creeks are running dry  severely altering or stressing surrounding ecosystems  and contributing to the extinction of many aquatic species 
agricultural land loss and soil erosion  
lal and stewart estimated global loss of agricultural land by degradation and abandonment at 12 million hectares per year  in contrast  according to scherr  glasod  global assessment of human-induced soil degradation  under the un environment programme  estimated that 6 million hectares of agricultural land per year had been lost to soil degradation since the mid-1940s  and she noted that this magnitude is similar to earlier estimates by dudal and by rozanov et al  such losses are attributable not only to soil erosion  but also to salinization  loss of nutrients and organic matter  acidification  compaction  water logging and subsidence  human-induced land degradation tends to be particularly serious in dry regions  focusing on soil properties  oldeman estimated that about 19 million square kilometers of global land area had been degraded  dregne and chou  who included degradation of vegetation cover as well as soil  estimated about 36 million square kilometers degraded in the worlds dry regions  despite estimated losses of agricultural land  the amount of arable land used in crop production globally increased by about 9  from 1961 to 2012  and is estimated to have been 1.396 billion hectares in 2012 
global average soil erosion rates are thought to be high  and erosion rates on conventional cropland generally exceed estimates of soil production rates  usually by more than an order of magnitude  in the us  sampling for erosion estimates by the us nrcs  natural resources conservation service  is statistically based  and estimation uses the universal soil loss equation and wind erosion equation  for 2010  annual average soil loss by sheet  rill and wind erosion on non-federal us land was estimated to be 10.7 t ha on cropland and 1.9 t ha on pasture land  the average soil erosion rate on us cropland had been reduced by about 34  since 1982  no-till and low-till practices have become increasingly common on north american cropland used for production of grains such as wheat and barley  on uncultivated cropland  the recent average total soil loss has been 2.2 t ha per year  in comparison with agriculture using conventional cultivation  it has been suggested that  because no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates  it could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture 
meat production  
main article 
environmental impacts associated with meat production include use of fossil energy  water and land resources  greenhouse gas emissions  and in some instances  rainforest clearing  water pollution and species endangerment  among other adverse effects 
steinfeld et al  of the fao estimated that 18  of global anthropogenic ghg  greenhouse gas  emissions  estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents  are associated in some way with livestock production  a more recent fao analysis estimated that all agriculture  including the livestock sector  in 2011 accounted for 12  of global anthropogenic ghg emissions expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents  similarly  the intergovernmental panel on climate change has estimated that about 10 to 12  of global anthropogenic ghg emissions  expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents  were assignable to all of agriculture  including the livestock sector  in 2005 and again in 2010  the percentage assignable to livestock would be some fraction of the percentage for agriculture  the amount assignable to meat production would be some fraction of that assigned to livestock  fao data indicate that meat accounted for 26  of global livestock product tonnage in 2011  however  many estimates use different sectoral assignment of some emissions 
environmental specialists jeff anhang and robert goodland with the ifc and world bank  have put the ghg associated with livestock at 51   pointing out the fao report failed to account for the 8,769 metric tons of respiratory co2 produced each year  undercounted methane production and land use associated with livestock  and failed to properly categorize emissions related to the slaughtering  processing  packaging  storing and transporting of animals and animal products 
globally  enteric fermentation  mostly in ruminant livestock  accounts for about 27  of anthropogenic methane emissions  despite methanes 100-year global warming potential  recently estimated at 28 without and 34 with climate carbon feedbacks  methane emission is currently contributing relatively little to global warming  over the decade 2000 through 2009  atmospheric methane content increased by an average of only 6 tg per year  because nearly all natural and anthropogenic methane emission was offset by degradation   while atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by nearly 15,000 tg per year  at the currently estimated rate of methane degradation  slight reduction of anthropogenic methane emissions  to about 98  of that decades average  would be expected to result in no further increase of atmospheric methane content  although reduction of methane emissions would have a rapid effect on warming  the expected effect would be small  other anthropogenic ghg emissions associated with livestock production include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption  mostly for production  harvesting and transport of feed   and nitrous oxide emissions associated with use of nitrogenous fertilizers  growing of nitrogen-fixing legume vegetation and manure management  management practices that can mitigate ghg emissions from production of livestock and feed have been identified 
livestock production  including feed production and grazing  uses about 30  of the earths ice-free terrestrial surface  about 26  for grazing and about 4  for other feed production  the intensity and duration of grazing use vary greatly and these  together with terrain  vegetation and climate  influence the nature and importance of grazings environmental impact  which can range from severe to negligible  and in some cases  as noted below  beneficial  excessive use of vegetation by grazing can be especially conducive to land degradation in dry areas 
considerable water use is associated with meat production  mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed  there are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production  but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated  for example  green water use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation  and green water has been estimated to account for 94  of global beef cattle productions water footprint  and on rangeland  as much as 99.5  of the water use associated with beef production is green water  however  it would be misleading simply to assign that associated rangeland green water use to beef production  partly because that evapotranspirational use occurs even in the absence of cattle  even when cattle are present  most of that associated water use can be considered assignable to production of terrestrial environmental values  because it produces root and residue biomass important for erosion control  stabilization of soil structure  nutrient cycling  carbon sequestration  support of numerous primary consumers  many of which support higher trophic levels  etc  withdrawn water  from surface and groundwater sources  is used for livestock watering  and in some cases is also used for irrigation of forage and feed crops  whereas all irrigation in the us  including loss in conveyance  is estimated to account for about 38  of us withdrawn freshwater use  irrigation water for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9   other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector  for drinking  washdown of facilities  etc   is estimated at about 0.7   because of the preponderance of non-meat products from the livestock sector only some fraction of this water use is assignable to meat production 
impairment of water quality by manure and other substances in runoff and infiltrating water is a concern  especially where intensive livestock production is carried out  in the us  in a comparison of 32 industries  the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the clean water act and clean air act  but pollution issues from large livestock operations can sometimes be serious where violations occur  various measures have been suggested by the us environmental protection agency  among others  which can help reduce livestock damage to streamwater quality and riparian environments 
data of a usda study indicate that  in 2002  about 0.6  of non-solar energy use in the united states was accounted for by production of meat-producing livestock and poultry  this estimate included embodied energy used in production  such as energy used in manufacture and transport of fertilizer for feed production   non-solar energy is specified  because solar energy is used in such processes as photosynthesis and hay-drying  
changes in livestock production practices influence the environmental impact of meat production  as illustrated by some beef data  in the us beef production system  practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6  less fossil fuel use  16.3  less greenhouse gas emissions  estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents   12.1  less withdrawn water use and 33.0  less land use  per unit mass of beef produced  than in 1977  from 1980 to 2012 in the us  while population increased by 38   the small ruminant inventory decreased by 42   the cattle-and-calves inventory decreased by 17   and methane emissions from livestock decreased by 18   yet despite the reduction in cattle numbers  us beef production increased over that period 
some impacts of meat-producing livestock   these include waste reduction by conversion of human-inedible crop residues to food  use of livestock as an alternative to herbicides for control of invasive and noxious weeds and other vegetation management  use of animal manure as fertilizer as a substitute for those synthetic fertilizers that require considerable fossil fuel use for manufacture  grazing use for wildlife habitat enhancement  and carbon sequestration in response to grazing practices  among others

wind power  
main article 
wind turbines in an agricultural setting 
compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources  the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor 
electricity generation consumes no fuel  and emits no   unlike fossil fuel power sources  the energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months  while a wind farm may cover a large area of land  many land uses such as agriculture are compatible  with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use 
there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines  as there are around other artificial structures  the scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant  depending on specific circumstances  prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities  and protection of   affect the siting and operation of wind turbines 
there are conflicting reports about the effects of noise on people who live very close to a wind turbine

and   and is a significant contributor to
through emission of   for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector  by subsector  road transport is the largest contributor to global warming 
in developed countries have reduced the individual vehicles emission  however  this has been offset by an increase in the number of vehicles  and more use of each vehicle  some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied  energy use and emissions vary largely between modes  causing
to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport  and increase
and  
other environmental impacts of transport systems include
and automobile-oriented   which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands  by reducing transportation emissions globally  it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on earth s    
and climate change 
the health impact of transport emissions is also of concern  a recent survey of the studies on the effect of traffic emissions on pregnancy outcomes has linked exposure to emissions to adverse effects on gestational duration and possibly also intrauterine growth

further information 
human impact on biodiversity is significant  humans   including the dodo and  potentially  large megafaunal species during the last   though most experts agree that human beings have accelerated the rate of species extinction  the exact degree of this impact is unknown  perhaps 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction  some authors have postulated that without human interference the biodiversity of the earth would continue to grow at an exponential rate 
coral reefs  
main article 
human impact on coral reefs is significant 
are dying around the world  in particular  coral mining 
 organic and non-organic    
and the digging of
and access into islands and bays are serious threats to these ecosystems  coral reefs also face high dangers from pollution  diseases  destructive fishing practices and warming oceans  in order to find answers for these problems  researchers study the various factors that impact reefs  the list of factors is long  including the ocean s role as a   atmospheric changes      biological   impacts of
carrying agents to far flung reefs  pollutants 
and others  reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas 
general estimates show approximately 10  world s coral reefs are already dead  it is estimated that about 60  of the world s reefs are at risk due to destructive  human-related activities  the threat to the health of reefs is particularly strong in   where 80  of reefs are  
carbon cycle  
is the result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which is caused primarily by the combustion of fossil energy sources such as petroleum  coal  and natural gas  and to an unknown extent by destruction of forests  increased methane  volcanic activity and cement production  such massive alteration of the global carbon cycle has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies  ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration  extraction  distribution  refining  and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices  livestock contributes to climate change both thru the production of greenhouse gases and thru destruction of
such as rain-forests  according to the 2006 united nations fao report  18  of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock  the raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction millions of acres of rainforest and as global demand for meat rises  so too will the demand for land  ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock 
potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures  altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts  storms  and floods  as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption 
nitrogen cycle  
main article 
human impact on the nitrogen cycle is diverse  agricultural and industrial
 n  inputs to the environment currently exceed inputs from natural n fixation  as a consequence of anthropogenic inputs  the global
 fig  1  has been significantly altered over the past century  global atmospheric
 n2o  mole fractions have increased from a pre-industrial value of  270 nmol mol to  319 nmol mol in 2005  human activities account for over one-third of n2o emissions  most of which are due to the agricultural sector
