compressed natural gas  cng   methane stored at high pressure  can be used in place of
 petrol  
and    cng combustion produces fewer undesirable gases than the fuels mentioned above  it is safer than other fuels in the event of a   because natural gas is lighter than air and disperses quickly when released  cng may be found above oil deposits  or may be collected from landfills or wastewater treatment plants where it is known as  
cng is made by compressing
 which is mainly composed of   ch4   to less than 1 percent of the volume it occupies at   it is stored and distributed in hard containers at a pressure of 2025mpa  2,9003,600psi   usually in
or spherical shapes 
cng is used in traditional gasoline  automobiles that have been modified or in vehicles which were manufactured for cng use  either alone   dedicated    with a segregated gasoline system to extend range  dual fuel  or in conjunction with another fuel such as diesel  bi-fuel  
are increasingly used in   especially   the
region  indian capital of   and other large cities like       as well as cities such as lucknow  kanpur  etc  its use is also increasing in  
and
because of rising gasoline prices  in response to high fuel prices and environmental concerns  cng is starting to be used also in
and  
and   and  
the cost and placement of fuel storage tanks is the major barrier to wider quicker adoption of cng as a fuel  it is also why municipal government  public transportation vehicles were the most visible early adopters of it  as they can more quickly amortize the money invested in the new  and usually cheaper  fuel  in spite of these circumstances  the number of vehicles in the world using cng has grown steadily  30 percent per year   now  as a result of the industry s steady growth  the cost of such fuel storage tanks has been brought down to a much more acceptable level  especially for the cng type 1 and type 2 tanks  many countries are able to make reliable and cost effective tanks for conversion need 
cng s volumetric
is estimated to be 42 percent that of

any existing gasoline vehicle can be converted to a dual-fuel  gasoline cng  vehicle  authorized shops can do the retrofitting and involves installing a cng cylinder  plumbing  a cng injection system and the electronics  the cost of installing a cng conversion kit can often reach  8,000 on passenger cars and light trucks and is usually reserved for vehicles that travel many miles each year  cng costs about 50  less than gasoline and emits up to 90  fewer emissions than gasoline
locomotives  
cng locomotives are operated by several railroads  the
successfully retrofit a diesel locomotive to run on compressed natural gas before 2002  this converted locomotive was upgraded to utilize a computer controlled fuel injection system in may 2008  and is now the napa valley wine train s primary locomotive 
in peru  has run a cng locomotive on a freight line since 2005  vtkovice machinery group in czech republic starts to operate new cng locomotive at 2014  it s based on ckd chassis 714 fully restored by cz loko and fitted with cat 3412 engine reworked by marat engineering  the engine has fully electronic engine control system including electronically controlled ignition and multipoint fuel blowing and torque mapping  cng locomotives are usually diesel locomotives that have been converted to use compressed natural gas generators instead of diesel generators to generate the electricity that drives the traction motors  some cng locomotives are able to fire their cylinders only when there is a demand for power  which  theoretically  gives them a higher fuel efficiency than conventional diesel engines  cng is also cheaper than petrol or diesel 
advantages  
cng powered bus in madrid  spain being refueled 
have lower maintenance costs than other hydrocarbon-fuel-powered vehicles 
cng fuel systems are sealed  preventing fuel losses from spills or evaporation 
increased life of lubricating oils  as cng does not contaminate and dilute the crankcase oil 
being a gaseous fuel  cng mixes easily and evenly in air 
cng is less likely to ignite on hot surfaces  since it has a high auto-ignition temperature  540c   and a narrow range  515 percent  of  
cng-powered vehicles are considered to be safer than gasoline-powered vehicles 
less pollution and more efficiency 
cng emits significantly less pollution directly than gasoline or oil when combusted  e g  
 co2

 nox  
 sox  and pm     for example  an engine running on petrol for 100km emits 22kilograms of co2  while covering the same distance on cng emits only 16.3kilograms of co2 
due to lower carbon dioxide emissions  switching to cng can help mitigate   however  natural gas leaks  both in the direct use and in the production and delivery of the fuel  represent an increase in greenhouse gas emissions  the ability of cng to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the entire fuel lifecycle will depend on the source of the natural gas and the fuel it is replacing 
the
greenhouse gas emissions for cng compressed from california s pipeline natural gas is given a value of 67.70grams of
per
 gco2e mj  by carb  the    approximately 28 percent lower than the average gasoline fuel in that market  95.86 gco2e mj  
cng produced from landfill biogas was found by carb to have the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any fuel analyzed  with a value of 11.26 gco2e mj  more than 88 percent lower than conventional gasoline  in the
that went into effect on january 12  2010 
drawbacks  
compressed natural gas vehicles require a greater amount of space for fuel storage than conventional gasoline powered vehicles  since it is a compressed gas  rather than a liquid like gasoline  cng takes up more space for each gge     however  the tanks used to store the cng take up space in the trunk of a car or bed of a pickup truck which has been modified to additionally run on cng  this problem is solved in factory-built cng vehicles that install the tanks under the body of the vehicle  leaving the trunk free  e g     new

heavy vehicles on cng and diesel showed that cng had higher consumption  but same noise and pollution of co2 and particulates  however nox emission was lower 
codes and standards  
the lack of harmonized codes and standards across international jurisdictions is an additional barrier to ngv market penetration  the international organization for standardization has an active technical committee working on a standard for natural gas fuelling stations for vehicles 
despite the lack of harmonized international codes  natural gas vehicles have an excellent global safety record  existing international standards include iso 14469-2 2007 which applies to cng vehicle nozzles and receptacle and iso 15500-9 2012 specifies tests and requirements for the pressure regulator

comparison with other natural gas fuels  
compressed natural gas is often confused with lng     both are stored forms of natural gas  the main difference is that cng is stored at ambient temperature and high pressure  while lng is stored at low temperature and nearly ambient pressure  in their respective storage conditions  lng is a
and cng is a   cng has a lower cost of production and storage compared to lng as it does not require an expensive cooling process and cryogenic tanks  however  cng requires a much larger volume to store the energy equivalent of gasoline or petrol and the use of very high pressures  3000 to 4000 psi  or 205 to 275 bar   as a consequence of this  lng is often used for transporting natural gas over large distances  in ships  trains or pipelines  where the gas is converted into cng before distribution to the end user 
cng is being experimentally stored at lower pressure in a form known as an ang   natural gas  tank  at 35 bar  500 psi  the pressure of gas in natural gas pipelines  in various sponge like materials  such as
and mofs     the fuel is stored at similar or greater energy density than cng  this means that vehicles can be refueled from the natural gas network without extra gas compression  the fuel tanks can be slimmed down and made of lighter  weaker materials 
compressed natural gas is sometimes mixed with hydrogen    which increases the h c ratio    of the fuel and gives it a
up to eight times higher than cng

cng station in   argentina 
cng vehicles are commonly used in   where these vehicles are mainly used as taxicabs in main cities of argentina and brazil  normally  standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops  which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the cng injection system and electronics  argentina and brazil are the two countries with the largest fleets of cng vehicles  with a combined total fleet of more than 3.4 million vehicles by 2009  conversion has been facilitated by a substantial price differential with liquid fuels  locally produced conversion equipment and a growing cng-delivery infrastructure 
as of 2009 argentina had 1,807,186 ngv s with 1,851 refueling stations across the nation  or 15 percent of all vehicles  and brazil had 1,632,101 vehicles and 1,704 refueling stations  with a higher concentration in the cities of
and  
had an ngv fleet of 300,000 vehicles  and 460 refueling stations  as of 2009

in singapore  cng is increasingly being used by public transport vehicles like buses and taxis  as well as goods vehicles  however  according to channel newsasia and north korea state television on april 18  2008  more owners of private cars in this country are converting their petrol-driven vehicles to also run on cng  motivated no doubt by rising petrol prices  the initial cost of converting a regular vehicle to dual fuel at the german conversion workshop of c  melchers  for example  is around s 3,800  with the promise of real cost-savings that
bring over the long term 
singapore currently has five operating filling stations for natural gas  sembcorp gas pte ltd  runs the station on jurong island and  jointly with   the filling station at jalan buroh  both these stations are in the western part of the country  another station on the mainland is in mandai link to the north and is operated by smart energy  smart also own a second station on serangoon north ave 5 which was set up end of march 2009  the fifth and largest station in the world was opened by the union group in september 2009  this station is recognized by the guniness world records as being the largest in the world with 46 refuelling hoses  this station is located in toh tuck  the union group  which operates 1000 cng toyota wish taxis plan to introduce another three daughter stations and increase the cng taxi fleet to 8000 units 
as a key incentive for using this eco-friendly fuel singapore has a green vehicle rebate for users of cng technology  first introduced in january 2001  the gvr grants a 40 percent discount on the omv  open market value  cost of newly registered green passenger vehicles  this initiative will end at the end of 2012 as the government believes the  critical mass  of cng vehicles would then have been built up 
the ministry of transport of
passed a law in 2005 which required that all public transport vehicles - buses  trucks and taxis  be converted to run on cng  the government permitted several private companies to handle the conversion of existing diesel and petrol cars  and also to begin importing cng variants of buses and taxis  accidents and rumours of accidents  partly fueled by myanmar s position in local hydrocarbon politics  has discouraged citizens from using cng vehicles  although now almost every taxi and public bus in yangon  myanmar s largest city  run on cng  cng stations have been set up around yangon and other cities  but electricity shortages mean that vehicles may have to queue up for hours to fill their gas containers  the burmese opposition movements are against the conversion to cng  as they accuse the companies as being proxies of the junta  and also that the petrodollars earned by the regime would go towards the defense sector  rather than towards improving the infrastructure or welfare of the people 
in   the use of cng was originally introduced for taxicabs and airport limousines during the late-1990s  when new taxis were launched with cng engines while taxicab operators were encouraged to send in existing taxis for full engine conversions  the practice of using cng remained largely confined to taxicabs predominantly in the
and
due to a lack of interest  no incentives were offered for those besides taxicab owners to use cng engines  while government subsidies on petrol and diesel made conventional road vehicles cheaper to use in the eyes of the consumers    malaysia s state-owned oil company  also monopolises the provision of cng to road users  as of july 2008  petronas only operates about 150 cng refueling stations  most of which are concentrated in the klang valley  at the same time  another 50 were expected by the end of 2008 
as fuel subsidies were gradually removed in malaysia starting june 5  2008  the subsequent 41 percent price hike on petrol and diesel led to a 500 percent increase in the number of new cng tanks installed  national car maker
considered fitting its  
and
models with cng kits from prins autogassystemen by the end of 2008  while a local distributor of locally assembled
cars offers new models with cng kits  conversion centres  which also benefited from the rush for lower running costs  also perform partial conversions to existing road vehicles  allowing them to run on both petrol or diesel and cng with a cost varying between rm3,500 to rm5,000 for passenger cars

are active in expanding the footprint of cng filling stations in medium-size cities across the interior of the country  where at least two natural gas pipelines are operational   
in   the karachi government under the order of
in 2004 made it mandatory for all city buses and
to run on cng with the intention of reducing air pollution 
in
in 2012  the federal government announced plans to gradually phase out cng over a period of approximately three years given natural gas shortages which have been negatively affecting the manufacturing sector  aside from limiting electricity generation capacity  gas shortages in pakistan have also raised the costs of business for key industries including the fertilizer  cement and textile sectors 
has one of the largest fleets of cng vehicles and cng distribution networks in the world  there are 2335 cng fueling stations  with a total of 13,534 cng nozzles  the number of cng burning vehicles in iran exceeds 3.5 million  cng consumption by irans transportation sector is around 20 million cubic meters per day 
africa  
is amongst the top 10 countries in cng adoption  with 128,754 cng vehicles and 124 cng fueling stations  egypt was also the first nation in africa and the middle east to open a public cng fueling station in january 1996 
the vast majority 780000 have been produced as dual fuel vehicles by the auto manufacturer in the last two years  and the remainder have been converted utilizing after market conversion kits in workshops  there are 750 active refueling stations country wide with an additional 660 refueling stations under construction and expected to come on stream  currently the major problem facing the industry as a whole is the building of refueling stations that is lagging behind dual fuel vehicle production  forcing many to use petrol instead

and
as well as in the towns on the black sea     
and   cng vehicles are becoming more and more popular in the country  the fuel is mostly used by taxi drivers because of its much lower price compared to petrol  currently  as of july  2015  the city of sofia is rapidly renewing its public transport fleet with
buses running on cng  also  many companies switch to cng cargo vans and even heavy trucks for their daily operations within city limits 
in   there is one cng station located in the capital skopje  but it is not for public use  only twenty buses of the local public transport company have been fitted to use a mixture of diesel and cng  the first commercial cng station in skopje is in the advanced stage of development and is expected to start operation in july 2011

natural gas has been used as a motor fuel in canada for over 20 years  with assistance from federal and provincial research programs  demonstration projects and ngv market deployment programs during the 1980s and 1990s  the population of light-duty ngvs grew to over 35,000 by the early 1990s  this assistance resulted in a significant adoption of natural gas transit buses as well 
the ngv market started to decline after 1995  eventually reaching todays vehicle population of about 12,000 
this figure includes 150 urban transit buses  45 school buses  9,450 light-duty cars and trucks  and 2,400 forklifts and ice-resurfacers  the total fuel use in all ngv markets in canada was 1.9 pjs  petajoules  in 2007  or 54.6 million litres of gasoline litres equivalent   down from 2.6 pjs in 1997  public cng refuelling stations have declined in quantity from 134 in 1997 to 72 today  there are 22 in british columbia  12 in alberta  10 in saskatchewan  27 in ontario and two in qubec  there are only 12 private fleet stations
