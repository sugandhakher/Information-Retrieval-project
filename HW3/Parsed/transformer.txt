a transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through   electromagnetic induction produces an
within a conductor which is exposed to time varying   transformers are used to increase or decrease the alternating voltages in electric power applications 
a varying current in the transformer s primary winding creates a varying
in the transformer core and a varying field impinging on the transformer s secondary winding  this varying
at the secondary winding induces a varying
 emf  or voltage in the secondary winding due to electromagnetic induction  making use of
 discovered in 1831  in conjunction with high
core properties  transformers can be designed to efficiently change
voltages from one voltage level to another within power networks 
since the invention of the first constant
transformer in 1885  transformers have become essential for the     and utilization of alternating current electrical energy  a wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications  transformers range in size from
transformers less than a cubic centimeter in volume to units interconnecting the

for simplification or approximation purposes  it is very common to analyze the transformer as an ideal transformer model as presented in the two images  an ideal transformer is a theoretical 
transformer that is lossless and perfectly   that is  there are no
and
is completely confined within the   perfect coupling implies infinitely high core
and winding inductances and zero net  
ideal transformer connected with source vp on primary and load impedance zl on secondary  where 0   zl    
avarying current in the transformer s primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the core and a varying magnetic field impinging on the secondary winding  this varying magnetic field at the secondary induces a varying
 emf  or voltage in the secondary winding  the primary and secondary windings are wrapped around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings  with a
connected to the primary winding and load
connected to the secondary winding  the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions   see also   
ideal transformer and induction law
according to   since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer  a voltage is induced in each winding  according to eq   1  in the secondary winding case  according to eq   2  in the primary winding case  the primary emf is sometimes termed   this is in accordance with   which states that induction of emf always opposes development of any such change in magnetic field 
the transformer winding voltage ratio is thus shown to be directly proportional to the winding turns ratio according to eq  3  
according to the law of   any load impedance connected to the ideal transformer s secondary winding results in conservation of apparent  real and reactive power consistent with eq   4  
instrument transformer  with polarity dot and x1 markings on lv side terminal
the ideal transformer
shown in eq   5  is a reasonable approximation for the typical commercial transformer  with voltage ratio and winding turns ratio both being inversely proportional to the corresponding current ratio 
by
and the ideal transformer identity 
the secondary circuit load impedance can be expressed as eq   6 
the apparent load impedance referred to the primary circuit is derived in eq   7  to be equal to the turns ratio squared times the secondary circuit load impedance 
polarity
a
is often used in transformer circuit diagrams  nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings  positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding s dot end induces positive polarity voltage at the secondary winding s dot end 
real transformer
deviations from ideal
the ideal transformer model neglects the following basic linear aspects in real transformers 
core losses  collectively called magnetizing current losses  consist of
losses due to nonlinear application of the voltage applied in the transformer core  and
losses due to joule heating in the core that are proportional to the square of the transformer s applied voltage 
whereas windings in the ideal model have no resistances and infinite inductances  the windings in a real transformer have finite non-zero resistances and inductances associated with 
due to resistance in the primary and secondary windings
leakage flux that escapes from the core and passes through one winding only resulting in primary and secondary reactive impedance 
leakage flux of a transformer
leakage flux
main article 
the ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding  including itself  in practice  some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings  such flux is termed leakage flux  and results in
in
with the mutually coupled transformer windings  leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply  it is not directly a power loss  but results in inferior   causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage  particularly under heavy load  transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance 
in some applications increased leakage is desired  and long magnetic paths  air gaps  or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the
current it will supply  leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit   such as     and
or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as  
air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating  especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a dc component flowing in the windings 
knowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel  it can be shown that if the percent impedance and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance  x r  ratio of two transformers were hypothetically exactly the same  the transformers would share power in proportion to their respective volt-ampere ratings  e g  500 unit in parallel with 1,000kva unit  the larger unit would carry twice the current   however  the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant  also  the z impedance and x r ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary  corresponding 1,000kva and 500kva units  values being  to illustrate  respectively  z  5.75   x r  3.75 and z  5   x r  4.75

real transformer equivalent circuit
core loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model 
core or iron losses  rc
magnetizing reactance  xm 
rc and xm are collectively termed the magnetizing branch of the model 
core losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency  the finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current im to maintain mutual flux in the core  magnetizing current is in phase with the flux  the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects  however  all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits  with
supply  core flux lags the induced emf by90  with open-circuited secondary winding  magnetizing branch current i0 equals transformer no-load current 
the resulting model  though sometimes termed  exact  equivalent circuit based on
assumptions  retains a number of approximations  analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances  this introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances 
transformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests      winding resistance test  and transformer ratio test

by faraday s law of induction shown in eq   1  and  2   transformer emfs vary according to the derivative of flux with respect to time  the ideal transformer s core behaves linearly with time for any non-zero frequency  flux in a real transformer s core behaves non-linearly in relation to magnetization current as the instantaneous flux increases beyond a finite linear range resulting in
associated with increasingly large magnetizing current  which eventually leads to transformer
the emf of a transformer at a given flux density increases with frequency  by operating at higher frequencies  transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance  however  properties such as core loss and conductor
also increase with frequency  aircraft and military equipment employ 400hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight  conversely  frequencies used for some
were much lower  e g  16.7hz and 25hz  than normal utility frequencies  5060hz  for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early   consequently  the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages  e g  15kv  were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies 
power transformer over-excitation condition caused by decreased frequency  flux  green   iron core s magnetic characteristics  red  and magnetizing current  blue  
operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current  at a lower frequency  the magnetizing current will increase  operation of a transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages  losses  and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical  for example  transformers may need to be equipped with  volts per hertz  over-excitation
to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency 
one example is in traction transformers used for
and
train service operating across regions with different electrical standards  the converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage  ranging from as high as 50hz down to 16.7hz and rated up to 25kv  while being suitable for multiple ac asynchronous motor and dc converters and motors with varying harmonics mitigation filtering requirements 
large power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components  such as caused in switching or by lightning 
at much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically  a physically small and cheap transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency  the development of switching power semiconductor devices and complex integrated circuits made switch-mode power supplies viable  to generate a high frequency from a much lower one     change the voltage level with a small transformer  and  if necessary  rectify the changed voltage 
energy losses
real transformer energy losses are dominated by winding resistance joule and core losses  transformers  efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity  the efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent 
as transformer losses vary with load  it is often useful to express these losses in terms of no-load loss  full-load loss  half-load loss  and so on 
and
losses are constant at all load levels and dominate overwhelmingly without load  while variable winding
dominating increasingly as load increases  the no-load loss can be significant  so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply  designing
for lower loss requires a larger core  good-quality   or even
for the core and thicker wire  increasing initial cost  the choice of construction represents a
between initial cost and operating cost 
transformer losses arise from 
winding joule losses
current flowing through a winding s conductor causes   as frequency increases  skin effect and
causes the winding s resistance and  hence  losses to increase 
hysteresis losses
each time the magnetic field is reversed  a small amount of energy is lost due to
within the core  according to steinmetz s formula  the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by
w
h

where  f is the frequency   is the hysteresis coefficient and max is the maximum flux density  the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1.4 to 1.8 but is often given as 1.6 for iron 
eddy current losses
materials are also good
and a core made from such a material also constitutes a single short-circuited turn throughout its entire length 
therefore circulate within the core in a plane normal to the flux  and are responsible for
of the core material  the eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness  eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of plates electrically insulated from each other  rather than a solid block  all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores 
magnetostriction related transformer hum
magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material  such as the core  causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field  an effect known as   the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as
or   this transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at
and in
associated with television  
stray losses
leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless  since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle  however  any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer s support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat  there are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field but these are usually small 
core form   core type  shell form   shell type
mechanical vibration and audible noise transmission
in addition to magnetostriction  the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings  this energy incites vibration transmission in interconnected metalwork  thus amplifying audible  
core form and shell form transformers
closed-core transformers are constructed in  core form  or  shell form   when windings surround the core  the transformer is core form  when windings are surrounded by the core  the transformer is shell form  shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils  core form design tends to  as a general rule  be more economical  and therefore more prevalent  than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges  less than or equal to  nominally  230kv or 75mva   at higher voltage and power ratings  shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent  shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher mva applications because  though more labor-intensive to manufacture  shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kva-to-weight ratio  better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage 
construction
cores
laminated steel cores
laminated core transformer showing edge of laminations at top of photo
power transformer inrush current caused by residual flux at switching instant  flux  green   iron core s magnetic characteristics  red  and magnetizing current  blue  
transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability   the steel has a permeability many times that of
and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings  early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses  and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires  later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations  a principle that has remained in use  each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation  the universal transformer equation indicates a minimum cross-sectional area for the core to avoid saturation 
the effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux  and so reduce their magnitude  thinner laminations reduce losses  but are more laborious and expensive to construct  thin laminations are generally used on high-frequency transformers  with some of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10khz 
laminating the core greatly reduces eddy-current losses
one common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of
steel sheets capped with
pieces  leading to its name of  e-i transformer   such a design tends to exhibit more losses  but is very economical to manufacture  the cut-core or c-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together  it is then cut in two  forming two c shapes  and the core assembled by binding the two c halves together with a steel strap  they have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains  reducing reluctance 
a steel core s
means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed  when power is then reapplied  the residual field will cause a high
until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced  usually after a few cycles of the applied ac waveform  overcurrent protection devices such as
must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass  on transformers connected to long  overhead power transmission lines  induced currents due to
during
can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices 
distribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or   the higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load 
solid cores
powdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz  these materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical   for frequencies extending beyond the   cores made from non-conductive magnetic
materials called
are common  some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores  sometimes called  slugs   which allow adjustment of the
 and   of tuned radio-frequency circuits 
toroidal cores
small toroidal core transformer
toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core  which  depending on operating frequency  is made from a long strip of
or
wound into a coil  powdered iron  or   a strip construction ensures that the
are optimally aligned  improving the transformer s efficiency by reducing the core s   the closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an e-i core  the cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular  but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available  the primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core  this minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core s magnetic field from generating  
toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated e-i types for a similar power level  other advantages compared to e-i types  include smaller size  about half   lower weight  about half   less mechanical hum  making them superior in audio amplifiers   lower exterior magnetic field  about one tenth   low off-load losses  making them more efficient in standby circuits   single-bolt mounting  and greater choice of shapes  the main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity  see
below   because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path  toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current  compared to laminated e-i types 
ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies  typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz  to reduce losses  physical size  and weight of inductive components  a drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding  this is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil  as a consequence  toroidal transformers rated more than a few kva are uncommon  relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10kva  and practically none above 25kva  small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open  then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings 
air cores
a physical core is not an absolute requisite and a functioning transformer can be produced simply by placing the windings near each other  an arrangement termed an  air-core  transformer  the air which comprises the magnetic circuit is essentially lossless  and so an air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material  the leakage inductance is inevitably high  resulting in very poor regulation  and so such designs are unsuitable for use in power distribution  they have however very high   and are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications  for which a satisfactory coupling coefficient is maintained by carefully overlapping the primary and secondary windings  they re also used for
such as tesla coils where they can achieve reasonably low loss in spite of the high leakage inductance 
windings
windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage 
it has been suggested that
be
into this article     proposed since march 2014 
the
used for the windings depends upon the application  but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn  for small power and signal transformers  in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small  the coils are often wound from   such as
wire  larger power transformers operating at high voltages may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of  
cut view through transformer windings  white  insulator  green spiral    black  primary winding made of   red  secondary winding  top left  toroidal transformer  right  c-core  but e-core would be similar  the black windings are made of film  top  equally low capacitance between all ends of both windings  since most cores are at least moderately conductive they also need insulation  bottom  lowest capacitance for one end of the secondary winding needed for low-power high-voltage transformers  bottom left  reduction of
would lead to increase of capacitance 
high-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided
to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses  large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well  since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings  each strand is individually insulated  and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding  or throughout the whole winding  each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor  the transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor  and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself  the stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size  aiding manufacture 
the windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response  coils are split into sections  and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding 
power-frequency transformers may have
at intermediate points on the winding  usually on the higher voltage winding side  for voltage adjustment  taps may be manually reconnected  or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps  automatic on-load
are used in electric power transmission or distribution  on equipment such as
transformers  or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads  audio-frequency transformers  used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers  have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker  a
is often used in the output stage of an audio power
in a   modulation transformers in
transmitters are very similar 
dry-type transformer winding insulation systems can be either of standard open-wound  dip-and-bake  construction or of higher quality designs that include
 vpi  
 vpe   and
processes  in the vpi process  a combination of heat  vacuum and pressure is used to thoroughly seal  bind  and eliminate entrained air voids in the winding polyester resin insulation coat layer  thus increasing resistance to corona  vpe windings are similar to vpi windings but provide more protection against environmental effects  such as from water  dirt or corrosive ambients  by multiple dips including typically in terms of final epoxy coat 
cooling
cutaway view of liquid-immersed construction transformer  the conservator  reservoir  at top provides liquid-to-atmosphere isolation as coolant level and temperature changes  the walls and fins provide required heat dissipation balance 
see also 
to place the cooling problem in perspective  the accepted rule of thumb is that the life expectancy of insulation in all electrics  including all transformers  is halved for about every 7c to 10c increase in   this life expectancy halving rule holding more narrowly when the increase is between about 7c to 8c in the case of transformer winding cellulose insulation 
small dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers are often self-cooled by natural convection and
heat dissipation  as power ratings increase  transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling  forced-oil cooling  water-cooling  or combinations of these  large transformers are filled with
that both cools and insulates the windings  transformer oil is a highly refined
that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank  the mineral oil and
insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years  it is estimated that 50  of power transformers will survive 50 years of use  that the average age of failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years  and that about 30  of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures  prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant  which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure  with a great body of empirical study as a guide 
including
provides valuable maintenance information  this underlines the need to monitor  model  forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying  possibly difficult  power loading conditions 
building regulations in many jurisdictions require indoor liquid-filled transformers to either use dielectric fluids that are less flammable than oil  or be installed in fire-resistant rooms  air-cooled dry transformers can be more economical where they eliminate the cost of a fire-resistant transformer room 
the tank of liquid filled transformers often has radiators through which the liquid coolant circulates by natural convection or fins  some large transformers employ electric fans for forced-air cooling  pumps for forced-liquid cooling  or have
for water-cooling  an oil-immersed transformer may be equipped with a   which  depending on severity of gas accumulation due to internal arcing  is used to either alarm or de-energize the transformer  oil-immersed transformer installations usually include fire protection measures such as walls  oil containment  and fire-suppression sprinkler systems 
have properties that once favored their use as a   though concerns over their
led to a widespread ban on their use  today  non-toxic  stable -based oils  or
may be used where the expense of a fire-resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault  pcbs for new equipment were banned in 1981 and in 2000 for use in existing equipment in united kingdom legislation enacted in canada between 1977 and 1985 essentially bans pcb use in transformers manufactured in or imported into the country after 1980  the maximum allowable level of pcb contamination in existing mineral oil transformers being 50 ppm 
some transformers  instead of being liquid-filled  have their windings enclosed in sealed  pressurized tanks and cooled by
or
gas 
experimental power transformers in the 500to1,000kva range have been built with
or
cooled
windings  which eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses 
insulation drying
construction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced  drying is carried out at the factory  and may also be required as a field service  drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core  or by vapor-phase drying  vpd  where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core 
for small transformers  resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used  the heating can be controlled very well  and it is energy efficient  the method is called low-frequency heating  lfh  since the current used is at a much lower frequency than that of the power grid  which is normally 50 or 60hz  a lower frequency reduces the effect of inductance  so the voltage required can be reduced  the lfh drying method is also used for service of older transformers 
bushings
larger transformers are provided with high-voltage insulated
made of polymers or porcelain  a large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the
without letting the transformer leak oil 
classification parameters
transformers can be classified in many ways  such as the following 
  from a fraction of a volt-ampere  va  to over a thousand mva 
duty of a transformer  continuous  short-time  intermittent  periodic  varying 
frequency range      or

which loses energy through joule heating at a rate corresponding to square of the current  by transforming power to a higher voltage transformers enable economical transmission of power and distribution  consequently  transformers have shaped the   permitting generation to be located remotely from points of   all but a tiny fraction of the world s electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer 
since the high voltages carried in the wires are significantly greater than what is needed in-home  transformers are also used extensively in
to decrease  or step-down  the supply voltage to a level suitable for the low voltage circuits they contain  the transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with the supply voltage 
signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of

circuits to carry on a

transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has   such as between external cables and internal circuits  transformers made to medical grade standards isolate the users from the direct current  these are found commonly used in conjunction with hospital beds  dentist chairs  and other medical lab equipment 
history
discovery of induction
faraday s experiment with induction between coils of wire
electromagnetic induction  the principle of the operation of the transformer  was discovered independently by
in 1831 
in 1832  and others  the relationship between emf and magnetic flux is an equation now known as

where
 
e
 
  displaystyle    mathcal  e    
is the magnitude of the emf in volts and b is the magnetic flux through the circuit in  
preceded by francesco zantedeschi in 1830    faraday performed early experiments on induction between coils of wire  including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring  thus creating the first
closed-core transformer  however he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer  and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and emf in the windings

induction coils
main article 
faraday s ring transformer
the first type of transformer to see wide use was the   invented by rev 
of   ireland in 1836  he was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding  the larger the induced secondary emf will be  induction coils evolved from scientists  and inventors  efforts to get higher voltages from batteries  since batteries produce
rather than ac  induction coils relied upon vibrating
that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction  between the 1830s and the 1870s  efforts to build better induction coils  mostly by trial and error  slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers 
first alternating current transformers
by the 1870s  efficient
producing
were available  and it was found ac could power an induction coil directly  without an  
in 1876  russian engineer
invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of ac  the secondary windings could be connected to several
 arc lamps  of his own design 
the coils yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers 
in 1878  the   budapest  hungary  began equipment for electric lighting and  by 1883  had installed over fifty systems in austria-hungary  their ac systems used arc and incandescent lamps  generators  and other equipment 
and john dixon gibbs first exhibited a device with an open iron core called a  secondary generator  in london in 1882  then sold the idea to the
company in the united states  they also exhibited the invention in turin  italy in 1884  where it was adopted for an electric lighting system  however  the efficiency of their open-core bipolar apparatus remained very low 
early series circuit transformer distribution
induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to   until about 1880  the paradigm for ac power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit  open-core transformers with a ratio near 1 1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps  the inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp  or other electric device  affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit  many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit  including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil  efficient  practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s  but within a decade  the transformer would be instrumental in the   and in seeing ac distribution systems triumph over their dc counterparts  a position in which they have remained dominant ever since 
shell form transformer  sketch used by uppenborn to describe zbd engineers  1885 patents and earliest articles 
core form  front  shell form  back  earliest specimens of zbd-designed high-efficiency constant-potential transformers manufactured at the ganz factory in 1885 
the zbd team consisted of  
and
stanley s 1886 design for adjustable gap open-core induction coils
closed-core transformers and parallel power distribution
in the autumn of 1884   
and
 zbd   three engineers associated with the ganz factory  had determined that open-core devices were impracticable  as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage  in their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers  later called zbd transformers   they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a  wound around iron wire ring core or b surrounded by iron wire core  the two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day  which can as a class all be termed as either core form or shell form  or alternatively  core type or shell type   as in a  or b   respectively  see images   the ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world s first five high-efficiency ac transformers  the first of these units having been shipped on september 16  1884  this first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications  1,400 w  40hz  120 72 v  11.6 19.4 a  ratio 1.67 1  one-phase  shell form 
in both designs  the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core  with no intentional path through air  see
below   the new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of gaulard and gibbs  the zbd patents included two other major interrelated innovations  one concerning the use of parallel connected  instead of series connected  utilization loads  the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher  initially 1,400 to 2,000 v  than the voltage of utilization loads  100 v initially preferred   when employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems  closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes  businesses and public spaces  blthy had suggested the use of closed cores  zipernowsky had suggested the use of   and dri had performed the experiments 
transformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers  they also popularized the word  transformer  to describe a device for altering the emf of an electric current  although the term had already been in use by 1882  in 1886  the zbd engineers designed  and the ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for  the world s first
that used ac generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network  the steam-powered rome-cerchi power plant 
although
had bought gaulard and gibbs  patents in 1885  the
held an option on the us rights for the zbd transformers  requiring westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles  he assigned to
the task of developing a device for commercial use in united states  stanley s first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the emf present in the secondary winding  see image   this design was first used commercially in the us in 1886 but westinghouse was intent on improving the stanley design to make it  unlike the zbd type  easy and cheap to produce 
westinghouse  stanley and associates soon developed an easier to manufacture core  consisting of a stack of thin  eshaped  iron plates  insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material  prewound copper coils could then be slid into place  and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit  westinghouse applied for a patent for the new low-cost design in december 1886  it was granted in july 1887 
other early transformer designs
in 1889  russian-born engineer
developed the first
transformer at the
  general electricity company   in germany 
in 1891 
invented the   an air-cored  dual-tuned resonant transformer for producing very
at high frequency

notes
where vs is the instantaneous voltage  ns is the number of turns in the secondary winding  and d dt is the
of the magnetic flux  through one turn of the winding  with turns of the winding oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines  the flux is the product of the
and the core area  the magnetic field varying with time according to the excitation of the primary  the expression d dt  defined as the derivative of magnetic flux  with time t  provides a measure of rate of magnetic flux in the core and hence of emf induced in the respective winding  the negative sign is described by lenz s law 
although ideal transformer s winding inductances are each infinitely high  the square root of winding inductances  ratio is equal to the turns ratio 
this also implies the following  input impedance is infinite when secondary is open and zero when secondary is shorted  there is zero phase-shift through an ideal transformer  input and output power and reactive volt-ampere are each conserved  these three statements apply for any frequency above zero and periodic waveforms are conserved 
windings of real transformers are usually wound around very high permeability
but can also be

section

derives a transformer equivalent in terms of various measurable inductances  winding  self  leakage  magnetizing and mutual inductances  and turns ratio  which are collectively essential to rigorous counter emf understanding 
 the turn ratio of a transformer is the ratio of the number of turns in the high-voltage winding to that in the low-voltage winding   common usage having evolved over time from  turn ratio  to  turns ratio   however  some sources use the inverse definition 
a step-down transformer converts a high voltage to a lower voltage while a step-up transformer converts a low voltage to a higher voltage  an
having 1 1 turns ratio with output voltage the same as input voltage 
ansi ieee standard c57.13 defines polarity in terms of the relative instantaneous directions of the currents entering the primary terminals and leaving the secondary terminals during most of each half cycle  the word  instantaneous  differentiating from say phasor current 
transformer polarity can also be identified by terminal markings h0 h1 h2    on primary terminals and x1 x2   and y1 y2  z1 z2 z3    if windings are available  on secondary terminals  each letter prefix designates a different winding and each numeral designates a termination or tap on each winding  the designated terminals h1 x1   and y1  z1 if available  indicate same instantaneous polarities for each winding as in the dot convention 
when a voltage transformer is operated with sinusoidal voltages in its normal frequency range and power level the voltage polarity at the output dot is the same  plus minus a few degrees  as the voltage polarity at the input dot 
percent impedance is the ratio of the voltage drop in the secondary from no load to full load  and is here represented with the variable z  in some texts  z is used for absolute impedance instead 
a standardized open-circuit or unloaded transformer test called the
can also be used for the characterization of magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials including especially electrical steels 
experimental transformers using
windings achieve efficiencies of 99.85  
transformer hum s fundamental noise frequency is two times that of the power frequency as there is an extension and a contraction of core laminations for every cycle of the ac wave and a transformer s audible hum noise level is dominated by the
and its first triplen   i e   by the 100   300 hz  or 120   360 hz  frequencies 
for example  the   by far the most common commercial three-phase transformer  is known as the dyn11 vector group configuration  dyn11 denoting d for delta primary winding  y for wye secondary winding  n for neutral of the wye winding  and 11 for relative phase position on the clock by which the secondary winding leads the primary winding  namely  30 leading 
while the above formal definition  derived from standards such as ieee c57.12.80  applies to large transformers  it is not uncommon in colloquial  or even trade  parlance for small general-purpose transformers to be referred to as  power  transformers  for distribution transformers to be referred to as  power distribution  transformers  and so on
