history  
pre-columbian  
the
indians were the first known settlers in what is now known as ventura county  fishermen built their villages along the pacific coast near the mouths of the calleguas creek and santa clara river  artifacts from their settlements are on display in the ventura county historical museum and their paintings are still visible on canyon walls and in caves in the area 
european exploration  
the portuguese navigator   while exploring the pacific coast for the king of spain  came upon the
in an area near   he explored the surrounding region and claimed it in the name of spain in 1542  cabrillo was followed in 1602 by sebastian viscaino on a mapping expedition for the king of spain  the chumash continued to inhabit the coast until 1768 when russians  having established a settlement 800 miles  1,300km  to the north  launched expeditions challenging the spanish land claims  in the 18th century  the spanish began settling california and built the first of what would become a chain of 21
in san diego 
establish the ninth mission in
in 1782 bringing more settlers to the area and exposing the indians who had settled around the mission to many european diseases to which they had no immunity  their numbers diminished until the chumash  once the largest indian nation in california  had largely vanished by 1839   
mexican independence  
by the early 1820s  mexico had gained independence from spain  and shortly afterward california allied itself with mexico  the mexican land grant system was liberalized in 1824 resulting in many large grants in california and the proliferation of ranchos north of the border  one grant to jos pedro ruiz created
in 1837  in the area that is now camarillo  the grant was later sold to juan camarillo  who had arrived in 1834 as a member of the   it was his sons adolfo and juan that are credited with the founding of the town that was to bear their name  the earlier proposed name of calleguas was rejected as too difficult to pronounce 
springville  
at about same time  the town of springville had begun to form just to the west of the emerging town of camarillo on the main road to ventura which is now the intersection of ventura boulevard and wood road  the springville post office  which was open from 1875 to 1903  was one of seventeen post offices operating in the county in 1890  p194  the springville school district was established in 1887 and the grammar school was south of the settlement on the main road  now pleasant valley road  to the
at hueneme where schooners brought lumber from the north and carried grain  lima beans and sheep to markets in san francisco  springville s existence was threatened though when the
coast route was routed farther south through pleasant valley and a depot was established in nearby camarillo  the settlement disappeared but in 2012 a new road was named springville drive to honor the little town and is now marked on the 101 freeway with an overpass and ramps at the western end of camarillo  the original settlement would have been nearby on the south side of the freeway 
st  john s seminary  
in 1927 don juan camarillo  brother of adolfo  donated 100 acres  0.40km2  to be used as a seminary to be named in honor of   the roman catholic seminary was opened in 1939 as  
early growth  
camarillo s growth was slow from founding through world war ii  in the late 1940s  building lots on   the main downtown street  were being offered for  450 and home lots on the adjoining streets were  250  with few buyers  travel to and from los angeles was difficult  owing to the narrow  tortuous road climbing the conejo grade to the east of the city   
one of the farm fields in southern camarillo 
the main industry during this period was agriculture  and the area surrounding the small town was blanketed with orange  lemon and walnut groves  the state mental hospital south of the town was the largest employer  a few houses had sprung up to the north and south of town center  the oxnard army air field  built during world war ii to the west of town  the navy facility at
and the seabee base at
brought many military personnel to the area  but there was little private industry or other source of non-agricultural employment  oxnard aaf closed at the end of world war ii  but the navy facilities remained open  with the
and associated
tensions  the former oxnard aaf was reactivated in 1951 as oxnard air force base 
ventura freeway  us route 101   
in the mid-1950s  the   which bisects the town  was completed from los angeles to points north  making it an easy one-hour trip to camarillo  the freeway was originally planned to follow the path of potrero road  south of camarillo  which would have completely by-passed the soon-to-be city  however  after much debate  city officials persuaded
to lay the freeway parallel to ventura boulevard  creating the infamously steep descent from the   known as the   the grade is about 2.7 miles  4.3km  and posted as a 7  gradewhich translates as about one thousand feet of elevation change in less than three miles  70 meters per kilometer   there is a
brake inspection station at the top of the grade and a stop is mandatory for all 18-wheel trucks  the completion of the freeway facilitated the growth that followed  in 1962  the population was 7,500 and
began construction for the
and magnetic tape divisions  which would ultimately employ 900 people  becoming the largest local employer  that plant briefly housed a factory for 3m
before being closed in 2008  housing tracts were built where orchards once stood  house prices were  14,000 to  65,000   
incorporation in 1964  
at this time plans were made for the incorporation of the city to control the rapid expansion  camarillo became a city in 1964 and soon put into place a general plan and building codes that were to lead to an attractive city environment  in 1964 the closest traffic signal was 2 miles  3.2km  from the city center on the road to point mugu  and the first shopping center and supermarket were under construction  because of the late date of city incorporation  the local telephone exchange is still listed as part of   much of the city was expected to be developed to the south of ventura blvd  however it was to the north that the new city grew  and the land south of ventura blvd remains reserved for agricultural use to this day   
many of the home buyers during the 1960s were military veterans  who had been stationed at one of the local bases during their service  the temperate climate and the living conditions lured them back  with the establishment of both the pacific missile range at nas point mugu and the naval civil engineering laboratory at port hueneme many found employment that utilized their military training  other newcomers were those who worked and lived in the san fernando valley and were willing to endure the commute for the opportunity to raise their families in a smog-free  semirural environment  still others relocated here with their employers  like 3m  and
who built facilities in and around the city to take advantage of the large workforce
