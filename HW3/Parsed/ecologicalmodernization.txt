ecological modernization
ecological modernization is an
school of thought in the social sciences that argues that the
benefits from moves towards     it has gained increasing attention among scholars and policymakers in the last several decades internationally  it is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy and

origins and key elements  
ecological modernization emerged in the early 1980s within a group of scholars at free university and the social science research centre in berlin  among them      and   various authors pursued similar ideas at the time  e g      donald huisingh  ren kemp  or   further substantial contributions were made by  
and
 mol and sonnenfeld  2000  mol  2001  
one basic assumption of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation of economic growth and industrial development  on the basis of   economy and ecology can be favourably combined  environmental   i e  productive use of natural resources and environmental media  air  water  soil  ecosystems   can be a source of future growth and development in the same way as
and capital productivity  this includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable     benign substitution of hazardous substances  and product design for environment  radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions  but also change the quality or structure of the   in the co-evolution of humans and nature  and in order to upgrade the environments   ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play  which may entail conflicts with nature conservation 
there are different understandings of the scope of ecological modernization - whether it is just about techno-industrial progress and related aspects of polity and economy  and to what extent it also includes cultural aspects  ecological modernization of mind  value orientiations  attitudes  behaviour and lifestyles   similarly  there is some pluralism as to whether ecological modernization would need to rely mainly on government  or markets and entrepreneurship  or civil society  or some sort of
combining the three  some scholars explicitly refer to general
as well as non-marxist   others dont 
ultimately  however  there is a common understanding that ecological modernization will have to result in innovative structural change  so research is now still more focused on environmental innovations  or eco-innovations  and the interplay of various societal factors  scientific  economic  institutional  legal  political  cultural  which foster or hamper such innovations  klemmer et al   1999  huber  2004  weber and hemmelskamp  2005  olsthoorn and wieczorek  2006  
ecological modernization shares a number of features with neighbouring  overlapping approaches  among the most important are

additional elements  
a special topic of ecological modernization research during recent years was sustainable household  i e  environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles  consumption patterns  and demand-pull control of supply chains  vergragt  2000  oecd 2002   some scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in   i e  inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency  i e  pollution prevention  waste reduction   typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another  christoff  1996   ecological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows  in this context  ecological modernization promotes  cradle to cradle  manufacturing   and   2002   contrasted against the usual  cradle to grave  forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process  another special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of
and the emergence of civil society as a key agent of change  fisher and freudenburg  2001  
as a
of change  some forms of ecological modernization may be favored by
interests because they seemingly meet the triple bottom line of economics  society  and environment  which  it is held  underpin sustainability  yet do not challenge
principles  this contrasts with many
perspectives  which regard
and its notion of business self-regulation as part of the problem  or even an origin of environmental degradation  under ecological modernization  the
is seen in a variety of roles and capacities  as the enabler for
that help produce the technological advances via competition  as the regulatory  see   medium through which
are forced to  take back  their various wastes and re-integrate them in some manner into the production of new goods and services  e g  the way that
corporations in germany are required to accept back cars they manufactured once those vehicles have reached the end of their product lifespan   and in some cases as an institution that is incapable of addressing critical local  national  and global environmental problems  in the latter case  ecological modernization shares with
 1999  37-40  and others notions of the necessity of emergence of new forms of   sometimes referred to as subpolitics or political modernization  where the   community groups  businesses  and other stakeholders increasingly take on direct and leadership roles in stimulating environmental transformation  political modernization of this sort requires certain supporting norms and institutions such as a free  independent  or at least critical press  basic
of expression  organization  and assembly  etc 
such as the
greatly facilitate this 
criticisms  
critics argue that ecological modernization will fail to protect
and does nothing to alter the impulses within the capitalist economic mode of production  see   that inevitably lead to environmental degradation  foster  2002   as such  it is just a form of     critics question whether
advances alone can achieve resource conservation and better   particularly if left to business
practices  york and rosa  2003   for instance  many technological improvements are currently feasible but not widely utilized  the most
product or manufacturing process  which is often also the most economically efficient  is not always the one automatically chosen by self-regulating corporations  e g 
or
vs     in addition  some critics have argued that ecological modernization does not redress gross
that are produced within the capitalist system  such as
- where
and low income earners bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harm such as pollution  and lack access to environmental benefits such as   and
issues such as eliminating
 bullard  1993  gleeson and low  1999  harvey  1996  -
is also referred to as issues of the asymmetric distribution of environmental resources and services  everett   neu  2000   moreover  the theory seems to have limited global efficacy  applying primarily to its countries of origin -
and the   and having little to say about the
 fisher and freudenburg  2001   perhaps the harshest criticism though  is that ecological modernization is predicated upon the notion of  sustainable growth   and in reality this is not possible because growth entails the consumption of natural and human capital at great costs to
and societies 
ecological modernization  its effectiveness and applicability  strengths and limitations  remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental social science research and policy discourse in the early 21st century
