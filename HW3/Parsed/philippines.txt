cosmopolitanism
one of the most visible hispanic legacies is the prevalence of
among filipinos  a spanish name and surname  however  does not necessarily denote spanish ancestry  this peculiarity  unique among the people of asia  came as a result of a colonial edict by governor-general   which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of
on the population  the names of many streets  towns  and provinces are also in spanish

have slight differences as both spanish and filipino ways of life assimilated differently due to the climate there and limestone and coral were used as building materials  idjangs or
castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the spanish conquest of the whole philippines 
the common use of the english language is an example of the american impact on philippine society  it has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of american pop cultural trends  this affinity is seen in filipinos  love of
and american film and music  fast food outlets are found on many street corners  american global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market  but local fast food chains like
and most notably   the leading fast food chain in the country  have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals

of filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems  especially those based in kinship  obligation  friendship  religion  particularly    and commercial relationships

universal dances in the philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals  mimicry  life cycle and parties  during the spanish era  most dances are accompanied by rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well

 a kind of short wide        and   filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors  but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors 
unlike many of their asian counterparts  filipinos do not eat with chopsticks  they use western cutlery  however  possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in philippine cuisine  the main pairing of utensils seen at the filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork  not knife and fork 
the traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan  using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth  was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas  however  due to the various filipino restaurants that introduced filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to filipino urbanites  kamayan fast became popular  this recent trend also sometimes incorporates the  boodle fight  concept  as popularized and coined by the philippine army   wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and filipino viands are placed all together for a filial  friendly and or communal kamayan feasting
