the aguadoura wave farm was the world s first   it was located 5km  3mi  offshore near
north of
in   the farm was designed to use three
to convert the motion of the
into electricity  totalling to 2.25 in total installed capacity  the farm was officially opened on 23 september 2008  by the portuguese minister of economy  the wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in november 2008

pelamis machines  
a pelamis machine at the wave park 
developed by the scottish company   the pelamis machine is made up of connected sections which flex and bend relative to one another as waves run along the structure  this motion is resisted by
which pump high pressure oil through
which in turn drive   the three machines which made up the aguadoura wave park were each rated at a peak output of 750  giving an installed peak capacity of 2.25mw  enough to meet the average electricity demand of more than 1,500 portuguese homes  the average output from a pelamis machine will depend on the wave resource in a particular area  the higher the resource the higher the average output  according to information on the pelamis web site  it appears that the average power output for a pelamis wave machine is about 150kw 
project management  
the project was originally conceived by the portuguese renewable energy company   which developed and financed the project and which was subsequently bought by the australian infrastructure company
in december 2005  in the last quarter of 2008  babcock   brown had its shares suspended and has been in a managed process of selling its assets  including the aguadoura project  in march 2009  babcock   brown went into voluntary administration 
in november 2008  the pelamis machines were brought back to harbor at
due to a technical problem with some of the bearings for which a solution has been found  however  the machines are likely to remain off-line until a new partner is found to take over babcock   browns 77  share in the project  this seems unlikely  because according to pelamis  those machines are sub-optimal  and the owner is trying to sell them  pelamis is now focusing its efforts on the new p2 machine  which has been tested in orkney in scotland since 2010
