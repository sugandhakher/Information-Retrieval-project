renewable energy in taiwan contributed to 8.7  of national

renewable energy policy  
in november 2003  the government has guaranteed the price of electricity generated from   in 2009  the government passed the renewable energy development act  reda  aiming to increase the installed renewable energy capacity in taiwan to 9.95 gw by 2030 
regulated by reda applies to solar  onshore wind  offshore wind  biomass and hydro energy 
in 2012  the million rooftop photo voltaic and thousand wind turbines programs were initiated  in 2014  the rising green energy industry program was also initiated 
a new law regarding greenhouse gas reduction and management act was ratified by the
on 15 june 2015 and promulgated by
on 1 july 2015 to provide the government with legal basis for taking action against   the measures  ranging from inventory  registration  inspection  management  efficiency standards and cap-and-trade system  call for gradual  phased process with control targets every five years 
president-elect
said in january 2015 that her party aimed to phase out nuclear power in taiwan by 2025 and to increase the share of renewable energy generation to 20  by that year

hydro energy  
in  
the first
in taiwan was built in 1905 during the   because of environmental concern  the construction of large hydro power plants are no longer planned  thus the trend moves to constructing small hydro power plants  in june 1995 
and
of the
completed an investigation to determine the potential of hydro power in taiwan  the research concluded that there is a potential of 11,730 mw theoretical hydro energy capacity  while the feasible capacity is 5,000 mw  since 2001  contribution of electricity from hydro power has decreased due to the aftermath of
on 21 september 1999 
at the end of 2005  the total installed capacity of hydropower in taiwan was 4,539.9 mw  of which 2,602 mw came from   taiwan s largest hydro power plant is the
opened in 1995  the plant is located in  
with a capacity of 1,602 mw  acting as the  
photovoltaic energy  
in  
taiwan photovoltaic installed capacity 
in 2013  the capacity factor of
was 14   the total photovoltaic power installed in taiwan as of 2013 was 206.4 mwp 
the government has built a
with a total power output of 189,492 kwh per year in       the project was divided into two phases  in which the first phase was completed in december 2011 and the second one in december 2014  the project was funded by the  
in may 2009  taiwan opened the
in  
which also acts as a   it is equipped with 141
with an installed capacity of 1 mw  currently taipower is undergoing the first phase of photovoltaic project which will be completed by december 2014 with a total installed capacity of 19.6 mw and a production of 24.957 gwh per year  this project is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emission by 10,500 tonnes per year 
the government has a long-term plan to make the solar capacity become 4,500 mw by 2020 and to make 7.5million taiwan residents to utilize solar energy by 2030  to give further incentives  the government has designated solar energy and led industries as two industries to be actively developed in the near future 
the
of photovoltaic energy supplied by small rooftop installations is nt 8.18 kwh and by ground-based photovoltaic installation is nt 5.62 kwh 
wind energy  
in    
taiwan has abundant of
resources  as of 2016  there are 326 ind turbines in operation with the total installed capacity of 644.4 mw  in which 169 are owned by taipower  in 2013  taiwan s onshore wind farm capacity factor is 28-29   while its future offshore wind farm is 33-38   with the total installed onshore wind capacity of 530 mw  there are currently 55 integrated and automated
systems established in       changgong and shihu 
the first phase of wind power installation was done in january 2003 until december 2008 in which 59 wind turbines were put into commercial operations in shinmen  tatan unit 1  guanyuan  shianshan   
and hengchun with a total installed capacity of 96.96 mw  the second phase was done in january 2005 until september 2011 in which 58 turbines were put into operation in changgong unit 1  yunlin mailiao  sihu  linko and tatan wind power stations  the third phase was done in january 2007 until july 2011 in which 28 turbines were put into operation in changgong unit 2  yunlin mailiao unit 2  changhua wanggong and tatan ii wind power stations with a total capacity of 59.6 mw 
the fourth phase of wind power installation is currently under construction with the expected completion schedule by june 2015 in which once completed  it will bring the total capacity of wind power to be 14.8 mw  generating 43.081 gwh per year  the penghu island low-carbon island wind power project is scheduled to be completed by the end of june 2016 with a total capacity of 33 mw  generating 116.251 gwh per year 
in 2007  the
in
started a project commissioned and funded by
to establish a 5,000m2 wind park at the campus area for educational and research purposes  it now hosts 47 small  experimental turbines installed by 20 international companies  all of the turbines have their own monitoring system which record the condition and efficacy  data is then transmitted by internet for analysis and improvements  the government plan to construct a total of 450 onshore wind turbines and 600 offshore wind turbines by 2030  aiming at a capacity of 4,200 mw  in which 1,200 mw will be for onshore and 3,000 mw will be for offshore  a 4mw offshore capacity in the  formosa 1  project is scheduled for 2016 
geothermal energy  
taiwan is estimated to have 33,640 mw of   however  the energy is largely untapped for producing electricity  the highest potential of geothermal energy are in      
and
in  
taiwan once developed a

in 19811993 but it ended in failure  in august 2016  an exploration drilling for geothermal energy began in   yilan county developed by
