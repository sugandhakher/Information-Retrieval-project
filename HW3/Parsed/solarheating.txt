solar-thermal collectors heating liquid  
solar collectors are either non-concentrating or concentrating  in the non-concentrating type  the collector area  i e   the area that intercepts the solar radiation  is the same as the absorber area  i e   the area absorbing the radiation   in these types the whole solar panel absorbs light  concentrating collectors have a bigger interceptor than absorber 
flat-plate and evacuated-tube solar collectors are used to collect heat for space heating  domestic hot water or cooling with an absorption chiller 
flat plate collectors  
flat plate thermal system for water heating deployed on a flat roof 
flat-plate collectors  developed by hottel and whillier in the 1950s  are the most common type  they consist of  1  a dark flat-plate absorber   2  a transparent cover that reduces heat losses   3  a heat-transport fluid  air  antifreeze or water  to remove heat from the absorber  and  4  a heat insulating backing  the absorber consists of a thin absorber sheet  of thermally stable polymers  aluminum  steel or   to which a matte black or selective coating is applied  often backed by a grid or coil of fluid tubing placed in an insulated casing with a glass or polycarbonate cover  in water heat panels  fluid is usually circulated through tubing to transfer heat from the absorber to an insulated water tank  this may be achieved directly or through a  
most air heat fabricators and some water heat manufacturers have a completely flooded absorber consisting of two sheets of metal which the fluid passes between  because the heat exchange area is greater they may be marginally more efficient than traditional absorbers  sunlight passes through the glazing and strikes the absorber plate  which heats up  changing solar energy into heat energy  the heat is transferred to liquid passing through pipes attached to the absorber plate  absorber plates are commonly painted with  selective coatings   which absorb and retain heat better than ordinary black paint  absorber plates are usually made of metaltypically copper or aluminumbecause the metal is a good heat conductor  copper is more expensive  but is a better conductor and less prone to corrosion than aluminum   see     in locations with average available solar energy  flat plate collectors are sized approximately one-half to one square foot per gallon of one day s hot water use  absorber piping configurations include 
harp traditional design with bottom pipe risers and top collection pipe  used in low pressure thermosyphon and pumped systems 
serpentine one continuous s that maximizes temperature but not total energy yield in variable flow systems  used in compact solar domestic hot water only systems  no space heating role  
flooded absorber consisting of two sheets of metal stamped to produce a circulation zone 
boundary layer absorber collectors consisting of several layers of transparent and opaque sheets that enable absorption in a boundary layer  because the energy is absorbed in the boundary layer  heat conversion may be more efficient than for collectors where absorbed heat is conducted through a material before the heat is accumulated in a circulating liquid   
polymer flat plate collectors are an alternative to metal collectors and are now being produced in europe  these may be wholly   or they may include metal plates in front of freeze-tolerant water channels made of   polymers are flexible and therefore freeze-tolerant and can employ plain water instead of antifreeze  so that they may be plumbed directly into existing water tanks instead of needing
that lower efficiency  by dispensing with a heat exchanger  temperatures need not be quite so high for the circulation system to be switched on  so such direct circulation panels  whether polymer or otherwise  can be more efficient  particularly at low light levels  some early selectively coated polymer collectors suffered from overheating when insulated  as stagnation temperatures can exceed the polymer s melting point  for example  the melting point of
is 160c  320f   while the stagnation temperature of insulated thermal collectors can exceed 180c  356f  if control strategies are not used  for this reason polypropylene is not often used in glazed selectively coated solar collectors  increasingly polymers such as high temperate silicones  which melt at over 250c  482f   are being used  some non polypropylene polymer based glazed solar collectors are matte black coated rather than selectively coated to reduce the stagnation temperature to 150c  302f  or less 
in areas where freezing is a possibility  freeze-tolerance  the capability to freeze repeatedly without cracking  can be achieved by the use of flexible polymers  silicone rubber pipes have been used for this purpose in uk since 1999  conventional metal collectors are vulnerable to damage from freezing  so if they are water filled they must be carefully plumbed so they completely drain using gravity before freezing is expected  so that they do not crack  many metal collectors are installed as part of a sealed heat exchanger system  rather than having potable water flow directly through the collectors  a mixture of water and antifreeze such as propylene glycol is used  a heat exchange fluid protects against freeze damage down to a locally determined risk temperature that depends on the proportion of propylene glycol in the mixture  the use of glycol lowers the water s heat carrying capacity marginally  while the addition of an extra heat exchanger may lower system performance at low light levels 
a pool or unglazed collector is a simple form of flat-plate collector without a transparent cover  typically polypropylene or epdm rubber or silicone rubber is used as an absorber  used for pool heating it can work quite well when the desired output temperature is near the ambient temperature  that is  when it is warm outside   as the ambient temperature gets cooler  these collectors become less effective  most flat plate collectors have a life expectancy of over 25 years 
applications  
the main use of this technology is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills  this generally means a situation with a large family  or a situation in which the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing  commercial applications include laundromats  car washes  military laundry facilities and eating establishments  the technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages 
systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate  or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water  unglazed liquid collectors are commonly used to heat water for swimming pools but can also be applied to large scale water pre-heating  when loads are large relative to available collector area the bulk of the water heating can be done at low temperature  lower than at swimming pool temperatures where unglazed collectors are well established in the marketplace as the right choice  because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures  they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber  many unglazed collectors are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below 44f on clear nights  a smaller but growing percentage of unglazed collectors are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber  the freeze concern only need be the water filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition  unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to  drainback  to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient  there are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems  commonly used in swimming pool heating since solar energy s early beginnings  unglazed solar collectors heat swimming pool water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers  hot water solar systems require heat exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of unglazed collectors  the pressure difference between the solar working fluid  water  and the load  pressurized cold city water   large scale unglazed solar hot water heaters like the one at the minoru aquatic center in richmond bc operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems so they require larger more expensive heat exchangers but all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated plastic pvc piping reduce costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types  when heating hot water we are actually heating cold to warm and warm to hot  we can heat cold to warm as efficiently with unglazed collectors as we can heat warm to hot with high temperature collectors
evacuated tube collectors  
evacuated tube collector
an array of evacuated tubes collectors on a roof 
most vacuum tube collectors in use in middle europe use heat pipes for their core instead of passing liquid directly through them  direct flow is more popular in china  evacuated heat pipe tubes  ehpts  are composed of multiple
tubes each containing an absorber plate fused to a   the heat is transferred to the transfer fluid  water or an
mixtypically   of a domestic hot water or
space heating system in a heat exchanger called a  manifold   the manifold is wrapped in insulation and covered by a protective sheet metal or plastic case  the vacuum inside of the evacuated tube collectors have been proven to last more than 25 years  the reflective coating for the design is encapsulated in the vacuum inside of the tube  which will not degrade until the vacuum is lost  the vacuum that surrounds the outside of the tube greatly reduces
and
heat loss  therefore achieving greater efficiency than flat-plate collectors  especially in colder conditions  this advantage is largely lost in warmer climates  except in those cases where very hot water is desirable  e g   for commercial processes  the high temperatures that can occur may require special design to prevent overheating 
glass-glass evacuated tube
some evacuated tubes  glass-metal  are made with one layer of glass that fuses to the heat pipe at the upper end and encloses the heat pipe and absorber in the vacuum  others  glass-glass  are made with a double layer of glass fused together at one or both ends with a vacuum between the layers  like a
or flask   with the absorber and heat pipe contained at normal atmospheric pressure  glass-glass tubes have a highly reliable vacuum seal  but the two layers of glass reduce the light that reaches the absorber  moisture may enter the non-evacuated area of the tube and cause absorber corrosion  glass-metal tubes allow more light to reach the absorber  and protect the absorber and heat pipe from corrosion even if they are made from dissimilar materials  see   
the gaps between the tubes may allow for snow to fall through the collector  minimizing the loss of production in some snowy conditions  though the lack of radiated heat from the tubes can also prevent effective shedding of accumulated snow

a longstanding argument exists between proponents of these two technologies  some of this can be related to the physical structure of evacuated tube collectors which have a discontinuous absorbance area  an array of evacuated tubes on a roof has open space between the collector tubes  and vacuum between the two concentric glass tubes of each collector  collector tubes cover only a fraction of a unit area of a roof  if evacuated tubes are compared with flat-plate collectors on the basis of area of roof occupied  a different conclusion might be reached than if the areas of absorber were compared  in addition  the iso 9806 standard is ambiguous in describing the way in which the efficiency of solar thermal collectors should be measured  since these could be measured either in terms of gross area or in terms of absorber area  unfortunately  power output is not given for thermal collectors as it is for   this makes it difficult for purchasers and engineers to make informed decisions

a field trial
illustrating the differences discussed in the figure on the left  a flat plate collector and a similar-sized evacuated tube collector were installed adjacently on a roof  each with a pump  controller and storage tank  several variables were logged during a day with intermittent rain and cloud  green line   solar irradiation  the top maroon line indicates the temperature of the evac tube collector for which cycling of the pump is much slower and even stopping for some 30 minutes during the cool parts of the day  irradiation low   indicating a slow rate of heat collection  the temperature of the flat plate collector fell significantly during the day  bottom purple line   but started cycling again later in the day when irradiation increased  the temperature in the water storage tank of the evac tube system  dark blue graph  increased by 8 degrees c during the day while that of the flat plate system  light blue graph  only remained constant  courtesy its-solar     
flat-plate collectors usually lose more heat to the environment than evacuated tubes  as an increasing function of temperature  they are inappropriate for high temperature applications such as process steam production  evacuated tube collectors have a lower absorber plate area to gross area ratio  typically 6080  of gross area  compared to flat plates  based on absorber plate area  most evacuated tube systems are more efficient per square meter than equivalent flat plate systems  this makes them suitable where roof space is limiting  for example where the number of occupants of a building is higher than the number of square metres of suitable and available roof space  in general  per installed square metre  evacuated tubes deliver marginally more energy when the ambient temperature is low  e g  during winter  or when the sky is overcast  however even in areas without much sunshine and solar heat  some low cost flat plate collectors can be more cost efficient than evacuated tube collectors  although several european companies manufacture evacuated tube collectors  the evacuated tube market is dominated by manufacturers in the east  several chinese companies have track records of 1530 years  there is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long term reliability  however  evacuated tube technology is younger and  especially for newer variants with sealed heat pipes  still need to demonstrate competitive lifetimes  the modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance  for example if the vacuum in one tube diminishes 
chart showing flat-plate collectors outperforming evacuated tubes up until 120f above ambient and  shaded in gray  the normal operating range for solar domestic hot water systems 
for a given absorber area  evacuated tubes can therefore maintain their efficiency over a wide range of ambient temperatures and heating requirements  in most climates  flat-plate collectors will generally be more cost-effective than evacuated tubes  when employed in arrays and considered instead on a per square metre basis  the efficient but costly evacuated tube collectors can have a net benefit in winter and summer  they are well-suited to cold ambient temperatures and work well in situations of consistently low sunshine  providing heat more consistently than flat plate collectors per square metre  heating of water by a medium to low amount  i e  tm-ta  is much more efficiently performed by flat plate collectors  domestic hot water frequently falls into this medium category  glazed or unglazed flat collectors are the preferred devices for heating swimming pool water  unglazed collectors may be suitable in tropical or subtropical environments if domestic hot water needs to be heated by less than 20c  a contour map can show which type is more effective  both thermal efficiency and energy cost  for any geographic region 
ehpt s work as a thermal one-way valve due to their heat pipes  this gives them an inherent maximum
that acts as a safety feature  they have less aerodynamic drag  which may allow them to be placed onto the roof without being tied down  they can collect thermal radiation from the bottom in addition to the top  tubes can be replaced individually without stopping the entire system  there is no condensation or corrosion within the tubes  one hurdle to wider adoption of evacuated tube collectors in some markets is their inability to pass internal thermal shock tests where iso 9806-2 section 9 class b is a requirement for durability certification  this means that if unprotected evacuated tube collectors are exposed to full sun for too long prior to being filled with cold water the tubes may shatter due to the rapid temperature shift  there is also the question of vacuum leakage  flat panels have been around much longer and are less expensive  they may be easier to clean  other properties  such as appearance and ease of installation are more subjective 
bowl  
a solar bowl is a type of solar thermal collector that operates similarly to a   but instead of using a tracking parabolic mirror with a fixed receiver  it has a fixed spherical mirror with a tracking receiver  this reduces efficiency  but makes it cheaper to build and operate  designers call it a fixed mirror distributed focus solar power system  the main reason for its development was to eliminate the cost of moving a large mirror to track the sun as with parabolic dish systems 
a fixed parabolic mirror creates a variously shaped image of the sun as it moves across the sky  only when the mirror is pointed directly at the sun does the light focus on one point  that is why parabolic dish systems track the sun  a fixed
focuses the light in the same place independent of the sun s position  the light  however  is not directed to one point but is distributed on a line from the surface of the mirror to one half radius  along a line that runs through the sphere center and the sun  
typical energy density along the 1/2 radius length focal line of a spherical reflector
as the sun moves across the sky  the aperture of any fixed collector changes  this causes changes in the amount of captured sunlight  producing what is called the sinus effect of power output  proponents of the solar bowl design claim the reduction in overall power output compared with tracking parabolic mirrors is offset by lower system costs 
the sunlight concentrated at the focal line of a spherical reflector is collected using a tracking receiver  this receiver is pivoted around the focal line and is usually counterbalanced  the receiver may consist of pipes carrying fluid for thermal transfer or
for direct conversion of light to electricity 
the solar bowl design resulted from a project of the electrical engineering department of the texas technical university  headed by edwin o hair  to develop a 5 mwe power plant  a solar bowl was built for the town of
as a pilot facility  the bowl had a diameter of 65ft  20m   tilted at a 15 angle to optimize the cost yield relation  33 would have maximized yield   the rim of the hemisphere was  trimmed  to 60  creating a maximum aperture of 3,318 square feet  308.3m2   this pilot bowl produced electricity at a rate of 10kw peak   
a 15-meter diameter auroville solar bowl was developed from an earlier test of a 3.5-meter bowl in 19791982 by the   that test showed the use of the solar bowl in the production of steam for cooking  the full-scale project to build a solar bowl and kitchen ran from 1996  and was fully operational by 2001   
solar-thermal collectors heating air  
a simple solar air collector consists of an absorber material  sometimes having a selective surface  to capture radiation from the sun and transfers this thermal energy to air via conduction heat transfer  this heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs  functioning in a similar manner as a conventional forced air furnace  solar-thermal-air systems provide heat by circulating air over an energy collecting surface  absorbing the suns thermal energy  and ducting air coming in contact with it  simple and effective collectors can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications 
a variety of applications can utilize solar air heat technologies to reduce the carbon footprint from use of conventional heat sources  such as fossil fuels  to create a sustainable means to produce thermal energy  applications such as space heating  greenhouse season extension  pre-heating ventilation makeup air  or process heat can be addressed by solar air heat devices  in the field of solar co-generation solar thermal technologies are paired with photovoltaics  pv  to increase the efficiency of the system by taking heat away from the pv collectors  cooling the pv panels to improve their electrical performance while simultaneously warming air for space heating 
space heating and ventilating  
space heating for residential and commercial applications can be done through the use of solar air heating panels  this configuration operates by drawing air from the building envelope or from the outdoor environment and passing it through the collector where the air warms via conduction from the absorber and is then supplied to the living or working space by either passive means or with the assistance of a fan  a pioneering figure of this type of system was george lf  who built solar heated air system for a house in boulder  colorado  in 1945  he later included a gravel bed for heat storage 
ventilation  fresh air or makeup air is required in most commercial  industrial and institutional buildings to meet code requirements  by drawing air through a properly designed unglazed transpired air collector or an air heater the solar heated fresh air can reduce the heating load during daytime operation  many applications are now being installed where the transpired collector preheats the fresh air entering a heat recovery ventilator to reduce the defrost time of hrv s  the higher your ventilation and temperature the better your payback time will be 
process heating  
solar air heat is also used in process applications such as drying laundry  crops  i e  tea  corn  coffee  and other drying applications  air heated through a solar collector and then passed over a medium to be dried can provide an efficient means by which to reduce the moisture content of the material 
solar air heating collector types  
collectors are commonly classified by their air-ducting methods as one of three types 
through-pass collectors
front-pass
back pass
combination front and back pass collectors
collectors can also be classified by their outer surface 
glazed
unglazed
through-pass air collector  
offering the highest efficiency of any solar technology the through-pass configuration  air ducted onto one side of the absorber passes through a perforated material and is heated from the conductive properties of the material and the convective properties of the moving air  through-pass absorbers have the most surface area which enables relatively high conductive heat transfer rates  but significant pressure drop can require greater fan power  and deterioration of certain absorber material after many years of solar radiation exposure can additionally create problems with air quality and performance 
back  front  and combination passage air collector  
in back-pass  front-pass  and combination type configurations the air is directed on either the back  the front  or on both sides of the absorber to be heated from the return to the supply ducting headers  although passing the air on both sides of the absorber will provide a greater surface area for conductive heat transfer  issues with dust  fouling  can arise from passing air on the front side of the absorber which reduces absorber efficiency by limiting the amount of sunlight received  in cold climates  air passing next to the glazing will additionally cause greater heat loss  resulting in lower overall performance of the collector 
glazed systems  
glazed systems usually have a transparent top sheet and insulated side and back panels to minimize heat loss to ambient air  the absorber plates in modern panels can have
of more than 93   glazed solar collectors  recirculating types that are usually used for space heating   air typically passes along the front or back of the absorber plate while scrubbing heat directly from it  heated air can then be distributed directly for applications such as space heating and drying or may be stored for later use  payback for glazed solar air heating panels can be less than 915 years depending on the fuel being replaced 
unglazed systems  
unglazed systems  or transpired air systems have been used to heat make-up or ventilation air in commercial  industrial  agriculture and process applications  they consist of an absorber plate which air passes across or through as it scrubs heat from the absorber  non-tranparent glazing materials are less expensive  and decrease expected payback periods  transpired collectors are considered  unglazed  because their collector surfaces are exposed to the elements  are often not transparent and not hermetically sealed 
unglazed transpired solar collectors  
background  
the term  unglazed air collector  refers to a solar air heating system that consists of a metal absorber without any glass or glazing over top  the most common type of unglazed collector on the market is the transpired solar collector  the technology has been extensively monitored by these government agencies  and natural resources canada developed the feasibility tool retscreen to model the energy savings from transpired solar collectors  since that time  several thousand transpired solar collector systems have been installed in a variety of commercial  industrial  institutional  agricultural  and process applications in countries around the world  the technology was originally used primarily in industrial applications such as manufacturing and assembly plants where there were high ventilation requirements  stratified ceiling heat  and often negative pressure in the building  with the increasing drive to install renewable energy systems on buildings  transpired solar collectors are now used across the entire building stock because of high energy production  up to 750 peak thermal watts square metre   high solar conversion  up to 90   and lower capital costs when compared against solar photovoltaic and solar water heating 
solar air heating is a solar thermal technology in which the energy from the sun  solar insolation  is captured by an absorbing medium and used to heat air 
solar air heating is a renewable energy heating technology used to heat or condition air for buildings or process heat applications  it is typically the most cost-effective of all the solar technologies  especially in large scale applications  and it addresses the largest usage of building energy in heating climates  which is space heating and industrial process heating  they are either glazed or unglazed 
method of operation  
unglazed air collectors heat ambient  outside  air instead of recirculated building air  transpired solar collectors are usually wall-mounted to capture the lower sun angle in the winter heating months as well as sun reflection off the snow and achieve their optimum performance and return on investment when operating at flow rates of between 4 and 8 cfm per square foot  72 to 144 m3 h m2  of collector area 
the exterior surface of a transpired solar collector consists of thousands of tiny micro-perforations that allow the boundary layer of heat to be captured and uniformly drawn into an air cavity behind the exterior panels  this heated ventilation air is drawn under negative pressure into the buildings ventilation system where it is then distributed via conventional means or using a solar ducting system 
hot air that may enter an hvac system connected to a transpired collector that has air outlets positioned along the top of the collector  particularly if the collector is west facing  to counter this problem  matrix energy has patented a transpired collector with a lower air outlet position and perforated cavity framing to perpetrate increased air turbulence behind the perforated absorber for increased performance 
this cutaway view shows the matrixair transpired solar collector components and air flow  the lower air inlet mitigates the intake of heated air to the hvac system during summer operation 
the extensive monitoring by natural resources canada and nrel has shown that transpired solar collector systems reduce between 10-50  of the conventional heating load and that retscreen is an accurate predictor of system performance  transpired solar collectors act as a rainscreen and they also capture heat loss escaping from the building envelope which is collected in the collector air cavity and drawn back into the ventilation system  there is no maintenance required with solar air heating systems and the expected lifespan is over 30 years 
variations of transpired solar collectors  
unglazed transpired collectors can also be roof-mounted for applications in which there is not a suitable south facing wall or for other architectural considerations  matrix energy inc  has patented a roof mounted product called the delta a modular  roof-mounted solar air heating system where southerly  east or west facing facades are simply not available 
each ten foot  3.05 m  module will deliver 250 cfm  425 m3 h of preheated fresh air typically providing annual energy savings of 1100 kwh  4 gj  annually  this unique two stage  modular roof mounted transpired collector operating a nearly 90  efficiency each module delivering over 118 l s of preheated air per two square meter collector  up to seven collectors may be connected in series in one row  with no limit to the number of rows connected in parallel along one central duct typically yielding 4 cfm of preheated air per square foot of available roof area   
transpired collectors can be configured to heat the air twice to increase the delivered air temperature making it suitable for space heating applications as well as ventilation air heating  in a 2-stage system  the first stage is the typical unglazed transpired collector and the second stage has glazing covering the transpired collector  the glazing allows all of that heated air from the first stage to be directed through a second set of transpired collectors for a second stage of solar heating 
solar-thermal collectors generating electricity  
  dishes and towers described in this section are used almost exclusively in
or for research purposes  although simple  these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration  for example  the parabolic trough concentration is about 1/3 of the theoretical maximum for the same   that is  for the same overall tolerances for the system  approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on   solar thermal collectors may also be used in conjunction with photovoltaic collectors to obtain combined heat and power 
parabolic trough  
main article 
parabolic trough
this type of collector is generally used in
plants  a trough-shaped
is used to concentrate sunlight on an insulated tube    or   placed at the   containing
which transfers heat from the collectors to the
in the power station 
parabolic dish  
solar parabolic dish
with a parabolic dish collector  one or more
dishes concentrate solar energy at a single focal point  similar to the way a
focuses starlight  or a
focuses radio waves  this geometry may be used in
and solar power plants 
the shape of a parabola means that incoming light rays which are parallel to the dish s axis will be reflected toward the focus  no matter where on the dish they arrive  light from the sun arrives at the earth s surface almost completely parallel  so the dish is aligned with its axis pointing at the sun  allowing almost all incoming radiation to be reflected towards the focal point of the dish  most losses in such collectors are due to imperfections in the parabolic shape and imperfect reflection 
losses due to atmospheric scattering are generally minimal  however  on a hazy or foggy day  light is diffused in all directions through the atmosphere  which reduces the efficiency of a parabolic dish significantly 
in
power plant designs  a
coupled to a dynamo  is placed at the focus of the dish  this absorbs the energy focused onto it and converts it into electricity 
power tower  
main article 
a power tower is a large tower surrounded by tracking mirrors called   these mirrors align themselves and focus sunlight on the receiver at the top of tower  collected heat is transferred to a power station below  this design reaches very high temperatures  high temperatures are suitable for electricity generation using conventional methods like
or a direct high temperature chemical reaction such as liquid salt  by concentrating sunlight current systems can get better efficiency than simple solar cells  a larger area can be covered by using relatively inexpensive mirrors rather than using expensive   concentrated light can be redirected to a suitable location via
for such uses as illuminating buildings  heat storage for power production during cloudy and overnight conditions can be accomplished  often by underground tank storage of heated fluids 
have been used to good effect  other working fluids  such as liquid metals  have also been proposed due to their superior thermal properties 
however  concentrating systems require
to maintain sunlight focus at the collector  they are unable to provide significant power in
conditions  solar cells are able to provide some output even if the sky becomes cloudy  but power output from concentrating systems drops drastically in cloudy conditions as diffused light cannot be concentrated
