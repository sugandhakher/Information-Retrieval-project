a temperature gradient is a
that describes in which direction and at what rate the
changes the most rapidly around a particular location  the temperature gradient is a
expressed in
of degrees  on a particular temperature scale  per unit length  the
unit is
per meter  k m  
temperature gradients in the
are important in the atmospheric sciences   
and related fields

physical processes  
climatology  
on a global and annual basis  the dynamics of the atmosphere  and the oceans  can be understood as attempting to reduce the large difference of temperature between the
and the equator by redistributing warm and cold air and water  known as earth s heat engine 
meteorology  
differences in air temperature between different locations are critical in weather forecasting and climate  the absorption of solar light at or near the planetary surface increases the temperature gradient and may result in
 a major process of
formation  often associated with   
are regions where the horizontal temperature gradient may reach relatively high values  as these are boundaries between
with rather distinct properties 
clearly  the temperature gradient may change substantially in time  as a result of diurnal or seasonal heating and cooling for instance  this most likely happens during an   for instance  during the day the temperature at
may be cold while it s warmer up in the atmosphere  as the day shifts over to night the temperature might drop rapidly while at other places on the land stay warmer or cooler at the same   this happens on the
sometimes due to geography 
weathering  
expansion and contraction of rock  caused by temperature changes during a   through   may result in
and subsequent structure failure
