who  in 1650  signed the charter creating the corporation which still governs harvard college

cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles  13km  by road from boston  the capital of the colony  by the   most residents lived near the
and harvard college  with farms and estates comprising most of the town  most of the inhabitants were descendants of the original puritan colonists  but there was also a small elite of
 worthies  who were not involved in village life  who made their livings from estates  investments  and trade  and lived in mansions along  the road to watertown   today s   still known as    coming up from

to cross the   a second bridge  the canal bridge  opened in 1809 alongside the new   the new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and
into prime industrial and residential districts

were built  the
 today s broadway and concord ave    the
 hampshire st  and

cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846  this was despite noticeable tensions between east cambridge  cambridgeport  and old cambridge that stemmed from differences in each area s culture  sources of income  and the national origins of the residents  the city s commercial center began to shift from harvard square to central square  which became the downtown of the city around this time  between 1850 and 1900  cambridge took on much of its present character development along the turnpikes  with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on east cambridge  comfortable middle-class housing being built on old estates in cambridgeport and mid-cambridge  and upper-class enclaves near harvard university and on the minor hills of the city  the coming of the railroad to north cambridge and northwest cambridge then led to three major changes in the city  the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between massachusetts ave   concord ave  and   the ice-cutting industry launched by
on   and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to provide housing to the thousands of immigrants that arrived to work in the new industries

as industry in new england began to decline during the
and after world war ii  cambridge lost much of its industrial base  it also began the transition to being an intellectual  rather than an industrial  center  harvard university had always been important in the city  both as a landowner and as an institution   but it began to play a more dominant role in the city s life and culture  when
was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation s most academically talented female students  also  the move of the
from boston in 1916 ensured cambridge s status as an intellectual center of the united states 
after the 1950s  the city s population began to decline slowly  as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples  the 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups  creating software such as
and   and advanced computers  but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the
and -based systems  the city continues to be home to many startups  kendall square continued to be a major software hub through the
and today hosts offices of major technology companies including       and
 headquarters  
in 1976  harvard s plans to start experiments with recombinant dna led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel  in the end  cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977  this led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when
opened a lab in 1982  in contrast to hostility which caused the genetic institute  a harvard spinoff  to abandon somerville and boston for cambridge  the biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in cambridge  which now includes headquarters for biogen and   and laboratories for                 and support companies such as   and many smaller companies 
by the end of the 20th century  cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the northeastern united states    while maintaining much diversity in class  race  and age  it became harder and harder for those who grew up in the city to be able to afford to stay  the end of
in 1994 prompted many cambridge renters to move to housing that was more affordable  in somerville and other communities
