a 12v vrla battery  typically used in
a vrla battery stands for  valve-regulated lead-acid battery  more commonly known as a sealed lead-acid  sla   gel cell  or maintenance free battery  is a type of   due to their construction  the gel and agm types of vrla can be mounted in any orientation  and do not require constant maintenance  the term  maintenance free  is a misnomer as vrla batteries still require cleaning and regular functional testing  they are widely used in large portable electrical devices 
systems and similar roles  where large amounts of storage are needed at a lower cost than other low-maintenance technologies like  
there are three primary types of vrla batteries  sealed vr wet cell    agm and gel  gel cells add silica dust to the electrolyte  forming a thick putty-like gel  these are sometimes referred to as  silicone batteries   agm  absorbed glass mat  batteries feature
mesh between the battery plates which serves to contain the electrolyte  both designs offer advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional batteries and sealed vr wet cells  as well as each other

basic principle  
lead-acid cells consist of two plates of lead  which serve as   suspended in diluted   which is then the   in conventional lead-acid cells  the diluted acid is in liquid form  hence the term  flooded  or  wet  cells  vrla cells have essentially the same lead-acid chemistry  but the agm and gel types have the diluted acid electrolyte solution immobilized  either by soaking a fiberglass mat in it  hence  glass-mat batteries   or by turning the liquid into a paste-like gel by the addition of silica and other gelling agents  hence  gel batteries   the wet cell type contains acid in the liquid form similarly to the flooded lead acid batteries  just the wet cell vrla battery case is better sealed 
when a cell discharges  the lead and diluted acid undergo a chemical reaction that produces lead sulphate and water  see
for details of the chemical reaction   when a cell is subsequently charged  the lead sulphate and water are turned back into lead and acid  in all lead-acid battery designs  charge current must be adjusted to match the ability of the battery to absorb the energy  if the charging current is too great  some of it will be wasted decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen  in addition to the intended conversion of lead sulphate and water into lead dioxide  lead  and sulphuric acid which reverses the discharge process  if these gases are allowed to escape  as in a conventional flooded cell  the battery may need to be topped up with water from time to time  in contrast  in vrla batteries the gases are retained within the battery as long as the pressure remains within safe levels  under normal operating conditions the gases can then recombine within the battery itself  sometimes with the help of a catalyst  and no topping-up is needed  however  if the pressure exceeds safety limits  safety valves open to allow the excess gases to escape  and in doing so regulate the pressure back to safe levels  hence  valve-regulated  in  vrla   
in flooded lead-acid batteries  the liquid electrolyte is a hazard during shipping and makes them unsuitable for many portable applications  furthermore  the need to maintain water levels makes them unsuitable for maintenance-free applications  the immobilized electrolyte in vrla batteries  agm and gel types  addresses these problems  at the same time  since vrla cells can t be  topped off  with water  any hydrogen lost during outgassing can t easily be replaced  to some extent  this can be compensated for by overprovisioning the quantity of electrolyte  but at the cost of increased weight  the main downside to the vrla design is that the immobilizing agent also impedes the chemical reactions that generate current  for this reason  vrlas have lower peak power ratings than conventional designs  this makes them less useful for roles like car starting batteries where usage patterns are brief high-current pulses  during starting  followed by long slow recharging cycles  vrlas are mostly found in roles where the charge recharge cycles are slower  such as power storage applications 
both flooded and vrla designs require suitable ventilation around the batteries  both to prevent hydrogen concentrations from building up  hydrogen gas is highly flammable   and to ensure that the batteries receive adequate cooling 
construction  
vrla cells may be made of flat plates similar to a conventional flooded leadacid battery  or may be made in a spiral roll form to make cylindrical cells 
vrla batteries have a pressure relief valve which will activate when the battery starts building pressure of hydrogen gas  generally a result of being recharged  valve activation allows some of the gas or electrolyte to escape  thus decreasing the overall capacity of the battery  rectangular
may have valves set to operate as low as 1 or 2 psi  round spiral cells  with metal external containers  can have valves set as high as 40 psi 
the cell covers typically have gas diffuses built into them that allow safe dispersal of any excess hydrogen that may be formed during   they are not permanently sealed  but are designated to be  maintenance free   they can be oriented in any manner  unlike normal leadacid batteries  which must be kept upright to avoid acid spills and to keep the plates  orientation vertical  cells may be operated with the plates horizontal  pancake style   which may improve cycle life 
at high overcharge currents 
occurs  expelling
and
gas through the battery s valves  care must be taken to prevent short circuits and rapid charging  constant-voltage charging is the usual  most efficient and fastest charging method for vrla batteries  although other methods can be used  vrla batteries may be continually  float  charged at around 2.35 volts per cell at 25c  some designs can be fast charged  1 hour  at high rates  sustained charging at 2.7v per cell will damage the cells  constant-current overcharging at high rates  rates faster than restoring the rated capacity in three hours  will exceed the capacity of the cell to recombine hydrogen and oxygen 
history  
the first lead-acid gel battery was invented by elektrotechnische fabrik sonneberg in 1934  the modern gel or vrla battery was invented by otto jache of sonnenschein in 1957  the first agm cell was the cyclon  patented by gates rubber corporation in 1972 and now produced by enersys  the cyclon is a spiral-wound cell with thin lead foil electrodes  a number of manufacturers seized on the technology to implement it in cells with conventional flat plates  in the mid-1980s two uk companies  chloride and tungstone  simultaneously introduced 10 year life agm batteries in capacities up to 400 ah  stimulated by a british telecom specification for batteries for support of new digital exchanges  in the same period  gates acquired another uk company  varley  specialising in aircraft and military batteries  varley adapted the cyclon lead foil technology to produce flat plate batteries with exceptional high rate output  these gained approval for a variety of aircraft including the bae 125 and 146 business jets  the harrier and its derivative the av8b  and some f16 variants as the first alternatives to the normal nicd batteries 
moves to higher capacity agm batteries were led by gnb s absolyte range extending to 3900 ah  vrla agm technology is now widespread in both stationary and vehicle batteries 
agm  absorbent glass mat   
agm batteries differ from flooded lead acid batteries in that the electrolyte is held in the glass mats  as opposed to freely flooding the plates  very thin
are woven into a mat to increase surface area enough to hold sufficient electrolyte on the cells for their lifetime  the fibers that compose the fine glass mat do not absorb nor are they affected by the acidic electrolyte  these mats are wrung out 25  after being soaked in acids  prior to manufacture completion and sealing 
the plates in an agm battery may be any shape  some are flat  others are bent or rolled  agm batteries  both deep cycle and starting  are built in a rectangular case to
battery code specifications 
disassembled agm battery  from left  positive plate  glass mat separator  negative plate  on the right are the five remaining cells  of the six-cell battery  
gel battery  
originally a kind of gel cell was produced in the early 1930s for portable valve  tube  radio lt supply  2  4 or 6v  by adding silica to the sulfuric acid  by this time the glass case was being replaced by celluloid and later in 1930s other plastics  earlier  wet  cells in glass jars used special valves to allow tilt from vertical to one horizontal direction in 1927 to 1931 or 1932  the gel cells were less likely to leak when the portable set was handled roughly 
a modern gel battery  also known as a  gel cell   is a vrla battery with a
  the
is mixed with   which makes the resulting mass gel-like and immobile  unlike a flooded wet-cell lead-acid battery  these batteries do not need to be kept upright  gel batteries reduce the electrolyte evaporation  spillage  and subsequent
problems  common to the wet-cell battery  and boast greater resistance to shock and   chemically they are almost the same as wet  non-sealed  batteries except that the
in the lead plates is replaced by   and gas recombination can take place 
the modern gel formulation and large scale production was from otto jache s and heinz schroeder s
assigned to the german company accumulatorenfabrik sonnenschein gmbh  with gel electrolyte the separator was no longer such a critical  hard-to-make component  and cycle life was increased  in some cases dramatically  shedding of active material from the plates was reduced 
more importantly  gas recombination was used to make batteries that were not  watered  and could be called maintenance-free  the one-way valves were set at 2 psi  and this was high enough for full recombination to take place  at the end of charge when oxygen was evolved from overcharge on the positive plate  it traveled through the shrinkage cracks in the gel directly to the negative plate  made from high surface area pure sponge lead  and  burned  up as fast as it was made  this oxygen gas and the hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of the sponge lead metal negative plate combined to make water that was retained in the cell 
this sealed  non-spill feature made it possible to make very small vrla batteries  1 12 amp hr  range  that fit into the growing portable electronics market  a large market for inexpensive smaller sealed lead acid batteries was generated quickly  portable tv  light for news cameras  children s toy riding cars  emergency lighting  and ups systems for computer back-up  to name a few  were powered with small sealed vrla batteries 
applications  
many modern motorcycles and
on the market use agm batteries to reduce likelihood of acid spilling during cornering  vibration  or after accidents  and for packaging reasons  the lighter  smaller battery can be installed at an odd angle if needed for the design of the motorcycle  due to the higher manufacturing costs compared with flooded leadacid batteries  agm batteries are currently used on premium vehicles  as vehicles become heavier and equipped with more electronic devices such as navigation    and premium stereos  agm batteries are being employed to lower vehicle weight and provide better electrical reliability compared with flooded leadacid batteries 
from march 2007 incorporate agm batteries in conjunction with devices for recovering brake energy using
and computer control to ensure the alternator charges the battery when the car is decelerating  vehicles used in
may use agm batteries due to their vibration resistance 
deep-cycle agms are also commonly used in
and
installations as an energy storage bank and in large-scale   such as the
and
competitions 
agm batteries are routinely chosen for remote sensors such as
stations in the   agm batteries  due to their lack of free electrolyte  will not crack and leak in these cold environments 
vrla batteries are used extensively in power wheelchairs  as the extremely low gas and acid output makes them much safer for indoor use  vrla batteries are also used in the ups    as a back up when the electrical power goes off 
vrla batteries are also the standard power source in sailplanes  due to their ability to withstand a variety of flight attitudes and a relatively large ambient temperature range with no adverse effects  however  charging regimes must be adapted with varying temperature  both agm and gel cells are commonly used in powered aerobatic aircraft  for the same reasons   
vrla batteries are used in the us nuclear submarine fleet  due to their power density  elimination of gassing  reduced maintenance  and enhanced safety 
agm and gell-cell batteries are also used for recreational marine purposes  with agm being more commonly available  agm deep-cycle marine batteries are offered by a number of suppliers  they typically are favored for their low maintenance and spill-proof quality  although generally considered a less cost effective solution relative to traditional flooded cells 
in telecommunications applications  vrla batteries that comply with criteria in
requirements document   valve-regulated lead-acid  vrla  battery string certification levels based on requirements for safety and performance  are recommended for deployment in the outside plant  osp  at locations such as controlled environmental vaults  cevs   electronic equipment enclosures  eees   and huts  and in uncontrolled structures such as cabinets  relative to vrla in telecommunications  the use of vrla ohmic measurement type equipment  omte  and omte-like measurement equipment is a fairly new process to evaluate telecommunications battery plants  the proper use of ohmic test equipment allows battery testing without the need to remove batteries from service to perform costly and time-consuming discharge tests 
comparison with flooded leadacid cells  
vrla gel and agm batteries offer several advantages compared with vrla flooded lead acid and conventional   the battery can be mounted in any position  since the valves only operate on over-pressure faults  since the battery system is designed to be recombinant and eliminate the emission of gases on overcharge  room ventilation requirements are reduced  and no acid fume is emitted during normal operation  flooded cell gas emissions are of little consequence in all but the smallest confined areas  and pose very little threat to a domestic user  so a wet cell battery designed for longevity gives lower costs per kwh  in a gel battery  the volume of free electrolyte that could be released on damage to the case or venting is very small  there is no need  or ability  to check the level of electrolyte or to top up water lost due to electrolysis  reducing inspection and maintenance requirements  wet cell batteries can be maintained by a self-watering system or by topping up every three months  the requirement to add distilled water is normally caused by overcharging  a well-regulated system should not require top-up more often than every three months 
the underlying fault with all lead acid batteries is the requirement for an excessively long charge time arising from a two-stage process  bulk charge and float charge  all lead acid batteries  irrespective of type  are quick to charge to 70  of capacity within 2 or 3 hours  but require another 9 to 10 hours to  float charge  after the initial charge  if users fail to float charge  battery capacity is dramatically reduced  all types of batteries have a  memory  in that every time a user charges to less than 100  charge  battery capacity is shortened  a lead acid battery could reach 4,600 cycles if it were kept on a shelf and kept at the right state of charge  to ensure a life of 8 years  a lead acid battery should be kept at full charge when stored  or dry   and  when working  kept at depth of discharge of less than 20   in addition  its discharge rate should be not more than three hours and its charge rate should be not more than three hours  c0.333     and it should be float charged properly  with less careful use  a lifetime of two to three years or 700-800 cycles might be expected  dependent upon the use environment 
because of calcium added to its plates to reduce water loss  a sealed agm or gel battery recharges more quickly than a flooded lead acid battery of either vrla or conventional design   from a standard car  4wd or truck alternator they will recharge quickly from full use in about 2 to 3 hours  a deep cycle wet cell battery can take 8-12 hours to achieve only 70  to 80  of its potential charge   compared to flooded batteries  vrla batteries are more vulnerable to thermal run-away during abusive charging  the electrolyte cannot be tested by hydrometer to diagnose improper charging that can reduce battery life 
agm automobile batteries are typically about twice the price of flooded-cell batteries in a given
size group  gel batteries as much as five times the price 
agm   gel vrla batteries 
have shorter recharge time than flooded lead-acid 
cannot tolerate overcharging  overcharging leads to premature failure 
have shorter useful life  compared to properly maintained  
discharge significantly less hydrogen gas 
agm batteries are by nature  safer for the environment  and safer to use 
can be used or positioned in any orientation
