 approximately  2002e  18,500,000 southern azeris in iran  concentrated in the northwestern provinces of east and west azerbaijan  it is difficult to determine the exact number of southern azeris in iran  as official statistics are not published detailing iran s ethnic structure  estimates of the southern azeri population range from as low as 12 million up to 40  of the population of iran  that is  nearly 27 million
