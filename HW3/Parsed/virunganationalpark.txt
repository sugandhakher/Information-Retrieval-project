history  
the park was created in 1925 by
as the first national park on the continent of africa  it was founded primarily to protect the
living in the forests of the virunga mountains controlled by the   but later expanded north to include the  
and the rwenzori mountains in the far north

in the first 35 years  the boundary of the park took shape  poaching was kept to a minimum  and sustainable tourism thrived due to the work of a large body of hand-picked congolese rangers and dedicated wardens  land remuneration and the use of park resources such as fishing and hunting by the local population became an ongoing problem and attempts were made to solve these issues 
when the belgians granted congo independence in 1960 the new state deteriorated rapidly  and so did the park  it was only in 1969 when president
began to take a personal interest in conservation  that the park was revived  in the process of mobutu s
campaign  it was renamed virunga national park  and the first congolese wildlife authority was established 
virunga fared well for the better part of the 1970s  foreign investment helped to improve the park s infrastructure and training facilities  and the park became a popular destination for tourists  receiving on average 6500 visitors a year  in 1979 unesco designated the park as a world heritage site 
in the mid-1980s the mobutu regime began to lose its hold on power and the country began a long slide into chaos  the park suffered terribly  poaching depleted virunga s large mammal populations  infrastructure was destroyed  and many rangers were killed  the congolese wildlife authority slowly lost control of virunga and unesco changed the world heritage site status to  endangered  
in 2013 the
raised concerns about plans by the uk based
to carry out exploration for oil in the park  currently more than 80  of virunga national park has been allocated as oil concessions   s own environmental impact assessment reports admit that oil exploration is likely to cause pollution  irreparably damage habitats and bring poaching to the park  the
have launched a campaign to petition soco to refrain exploring the world heritage area for oil  and thereby avoid these outcomes  as of august 30  2014  soco demobilized its operations in the drc 
world wildlife fund executives now acknowledge that the battle over virunga is hardly over  soco has yet to relinquish its operating permits or commit to an unconditional withdrawal 
geography

biodiversity  
a mountain gorilla in the park
the park is known for its exceptional  bio diversity  containing more bird  mammal and reptile species than any protected area on the african continent  although
are now extremely rare and listed as one of the most critically endangered species  successful conservation work has helped to secure the remaining populations  their populations actually increased during the years of political upheaval in the region  19942004   and have continued to do so even throughout the difficult period of 2007-2008  the 2010 mountain gorilla census has indicated that the conservation efforts of virunga have been very successful regarding the gorilla population  both savanna and
as well as
and low land gorillas can still be found in virunga  along with   giraffes 
and many endemic   the neighboring
area was managed with the park and is home to a population of bambuti
people 
and  
human conflict  
since the civil wars  the park has suffered somewhat  land invasions and intense poaching have challenged the park authorities to the limit  but most rangers have remained active  since 1994  about 140 rangers have been killed in the line of duty protecting the park from illegal poaching and land acquisition  amongst other military activity  the
 fdlr  used the park as a safe location when they have come under sustained attack  such as  s offensives against them in aprilmay 2007  the park was occupied by nkunda s forces on 26 october 2008  during the    
current situation  
however over the last three years   the park has seen remarkable regeneration  with heavy investment in tourism development  social infrastructure as well as safety  currently   over 3000 tourists a year visit the southern sector of virunga national park to admire the gorillas as well as the lava lake of the nyiragongo volcano  the park has been   closed until 20 july because of political insecurity  the
signed a 25-year management agreement to manage the park in march 2015  the park currently   receives most of its funding from the
and the howard g buffett foundation    a mai mai militia attacked a park facility and killed two park rangers and a congolese soldier in october 2012  five of the mai mai militiamen died in the attack  congolese revolutionary army  also known as m23  allegedly has a base camp inside the park 
  a respected naturalist and member of the belgian   has been the director of the park since 2008  on april 15  2014 he was
on a road in the park and shot four times in the stomach and legs by unknown assailants  but he survived the attack 
the
occurred inside the national park 
oil industry threat  
virunga is currently under threat from uk oil company soco who want to undergo oil exploration within the park  seismic tests were carried out by soco  and confirmed the presence of oil  this announcement has reignited the debate to the merits of exploring oil in the park  this could involve disruptive seismic testing  forest clearing  and deep underground drilling  this can put at risk hundreds of lesser known fragile species which are found in no other country  also  if lake edwards is drilled  it can have a detrimental impact on the people of the region  30,000 people benefit economically from fishing in the park  another 20,000 benefit from commercial activities related to the fishing industry  in response  a joint plea was launched by international environment and right groups to the ugandan government and republic of congo to prevent oil drilling in or around the virunga national park  regardless  the ugandan government plans to receive bids on six new oil licenses  to this day  no oil exploration has occurred 
on march 13  2015  bbc was reporting that the democratic republic of congo says it wants to redraw the boundaries of virunga national park to allow for oil exploration 
charcoal trade  
trees are being cut down at a rate of 2.3   the country has lost 14,331 square miles of forest between 2001 and 2010  the primary cause has been the charcoal industry  the charcoal industry is worth almost 2 billion dollars  virunga is the only source of charcoal for rwanda because they passed a law banning the production of charcoal within its border  trees are being cut down  covered in mud  and set on fire in order to make charcoal  there is also a strong military presence near virunga  and many of these soldiers have reportedly not received paychecks for years  therefore  these soldiers have turned to charcoal trade and other illegal activities in order to support themselves  many of the gorilla killings are fueled by the charcoal trade  there have been reported executions of gorillas as act of sabotage by people in the charcoal business who want to see the gorillas dead  many park officials risk their lives to protect the park  however  some are in collaboration with the military and poachers  poaching is a source of income for many people due to the economic instability in the country  many of poachers are members of local militias  most of money goes back to militias  and use the money to buy weapons 
in popular media
