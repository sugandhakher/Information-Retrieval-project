in       produced over millions of years  is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale 
a non-renewable resource  also called a finite resource  is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames  an example is carbon-based  organically-derived fuel  the original organic material  with the aid of heat and pressure  becomes a fuel such as oil or gas 
and
 
       and
in certain
are all considered non-renewable resources  though individual
are almost always conserved 
in contrast  resources such as
 when   and wind  used to power energy conversion systems  are considered   largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans

minerals and
ores are examples of non-renewable resources  the metals themselves are present in vast amounts in earth s   and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by
 such as heat  pressure  organic activity  weathering and other processes  enough to become economically viable to extract  these processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years  through  
and  
the localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames  there are certain
and
that are more scarce and exhaustible than others  these are in high demand in   particularly for the  
most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels  because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the earth s near-surface environment  than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish  die  and are quickly buried

natural resources such as  
 crude oil  and
take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed  eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power  see  
an alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms  if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor  which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined    these sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable  although their rate of formation replenishment on the sea floor is not known  however their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined 
at present  the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable   since the dawn of
technologies in the 17th century  petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand  as a result  conventional
and
systems  which are fitted to combustion engines  remain prominent throughout the globe  the continual use of fossil fuels at the current rate is believed to increase
and cause more severe

nuclear fuel than they consume -i e    and when it is developed    among conventional renewable energy sources  such as
and   the
likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable  but that
nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable  before explaining that radioactive waste from used
rods remains dangerous  and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years  with the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources  such as

as fuel    the most common fission fuel  and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and
in 19 countries  this mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with
which generates heat that is ultimately used to power
to generate electricity 
nuclear power provides about 6  of the world s energy and 1314  of the world s electricity  nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous
as it relies upon unstable elements  in particular  nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of
 lilw  and 10,000 metric tons of
 hlw   including spent fuel designated as waste  each year worldwide 
issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel  relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained  is
to people and wildlife  radiocontaminants in the environment can enter the
and become   internal or external exposure can cause
breakage producing
 
and other damage  the united nations    estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01
 msv  from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the
and the nuclear fuel cycle  along with 2.0 msv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 msv from   all exposures   natural uranium

and naturally in the ground emits radiation for the prolonged period of 4.5 billion years or more  and storage has   the storage of waste  health implications and dangers of radioactive fuel continue to be a topic of debate  resulting in a

the potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand  hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs  geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need  there is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over  wind power could power all of humanity s needs alone  solar currently supplies only 0.1  of our world energy needs  but there is enough out there to power humanity s needs 4,000 times over  the entire global projected energy demand by 2050 
renewable energy and
are no longer niche
that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists  the increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors  both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production  as non-renewable resources decline  this is reinforced by
concerns  nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste   
and increasing government support for renewable energy  these factors are   enlarging the market and growing demand  the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard 
economic models  
in economics  a non-renewable resource is defined as   where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow 
in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources  where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time  he argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction  and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent  the first model is defined by   which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable
by   it shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would  under otherwise stable conditions  lead to a
of the resource  the rule states that this would lead to a net price or    for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the   reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources  the
provides an important result about the
of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source 
however  nearly all metal prices have been declining over time in inflation adjusted terms  because of a number of false assumptions in the above  firstly  metal resources are non-renewable  but on a world scale  largely inexhaustible  this is because they are present throughout the earth s crust on a vast scale  far exceeding human demand on all time scales  metal ores however  are only extracted in those areas where nature has concentrated the metal in the crust to a level whereby it is locally economic to extract  this also depends on the available technology for both finding the metal ores as well as extracting them  which is constantly changing  if the technology or demand changes  vast amounts of metal previously ignored can become economically extractable  this is why ricardo s simplistic notion that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time has in fact turned out to be the opposite  nearly all metal ores have decreased in inflation adjusted prices since well before the early 20th century  the main reason he was wrong is that he assumed that metals are exhaustible on a world scale  and he also misunderstood the effect of globally competing markets  in human terms the amount of metal in the earth s crust is essentially limitless  it is only in localized areas that metal ores can become depleted  as these local areas compete with extraction costs of resources elsewhere  which does have ramifications for the sustainability of local economies
