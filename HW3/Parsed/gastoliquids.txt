gas to liquids  gtl  is a
process to convert
or other gaseous
into longer-chain hydrocarbons  such as gasoline or diesel fuel  -rich gases are converted into liquid
either via direct conversionusing non-catalytic processes that convert methane to methanol in one stepor via
as an intermediate  such as in the   mobil and
processes

gtl process using the
method
the fischertropsch process starts with partial oxidation of
 natural gas  to    
and water  the ratio of
to hydrogen is adjusted using the   while the excess
is removed with aqueous solutions of
 or physical solvents   removing the water yields
 syngas  which is chemically reacted over an iron or cobalt catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbons and other byproducts 
is provided from a
unit 
methane to methanol process  
methanol is made from
 natural gas  in a series of three reactions 
ch4   h2o  co   3 h2  rh    206 kj mol1
co   h2o  co2   h2  rh   -41 kj mol1
synthesis
2 h2   co  ch3oh  rh   -92 kj mol1
the methanol thus formed may be converted to gasoline by the mobil process 
methanol to gasoline process  mtg   
in the early 1970s 
developed an alternative procedure in which natural gas is converted to syngas  and then   the methanol polymerized over a
catalyst to form  
first methanol is
to give  
2 ch3oh  ch3och3   h2o
this is then further dehydrated over a zeolite catalyst such as   which would theoretically yield  
ch3och3  c2h4   h2o
but which in practice is polymerized and hydrogenated to give a gasoline with hydrocarbons of five or more carbon atoms making up 80  of the fuel by weight 
syngas to gasoline plus process  stg    
main article 
the stg  process
a third gas-to-liquids process builds on the mtg technology by converting natural gas-derived syngas directly into drop-in gasoline and jet fuel via a thermochemical single-loop process 
the stg  process follows four principal steps in one continuous process loop  this process consists of four
in series in which a
is converted to synthetic fuels  the steps for producing high-octane synthetic gasoline are as follows 
  syngas is fed to reactor 1  the first of four reactors  which converts most of the syngas  co and h2  to methanol  ch3oh  when passing through the catalyst bed 
 dme  synthesis  the methanol-rich gas from reactor 1 is next fed to reactor 2  the second stg  reactor  the methanol is exposed to a
and much of it is converted to dme  which involves a dehydration from methanol to form dme  ch3och3  
gasoline synthesis  the reactor 2 product gas is next fed to reactor 3  the third reactor containing the catalyst for conversion of dme to hydrocarbons including paraffins       naphthenes    and small amounts of olefins     mostly from c6  number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule  to c10 
gasoline treatment  the fourth reactor provides
and
treatment to the products coming from reactor 3  the treatment reduces
 tetramethylbenzene  isodurene and trimethylbenzene components that have high freezing points and must be minimized in gasoline  as a result  the synthetic gasoline product has high octane and desirable viscometric properties 
separator  finally  the mixture from reactor 4 is condensed to obtain gasoline  the non-condensed gas and gasoline are separated in a conventional condenser separator  most of the non-condensed gas from the product separator becomes recycled gas and is sent back to the feed stream to reactor 1  leaving the synthetic gasoline product composed of paraffins  aromatics and naphthenes 
commercial uses  
using gas-to-liquids processes  refineries can convert some of their gaseous waste products    into valuable   which can be sold as is or blended only with   the
estimates that over 150billion cubic metres  5.310 12cuft  of natural gas are
or vented annually  an amount worth approximately  30.6billion  equivalent to 25  of the united states  gas consumption or 30  of the european union s annual gas consumption  a resource that could be useful using gtl  gas-to-liquids processes may also be used for the economic extraction of gas deposits in locations where it is not economical to build a pipeline  this process will be increasingly significant as
resources are  
the use of   such as those developed by velocys  shows promise for the conversion of unconventional  remote and problem gas into valuable liquid fuels  gtl plants based on microchannel reactors are significantly smaller than those using conventional fixed bed or slurry bed reactors  enabling modular plants that can be deployed cost effectively in remote locations and on smaller fields than is possible with competing systems  construction is underway for one such plant  envia energy s oklahoma city gtl plant being built adjacent to waste management s east oak landfill site  the project is being financed by a joint venture between waste management  nrg energy  ventech and velocys  the feedstock for this plant will be a combination of landfill gas and pipeline natural gas 
on august 1  2014  biofuels power corporation  bfls  signed a letter of intent with thyssenkrupp industrial solutions and liberty gtl  inc  to build a small scale gas-to-liquid demonstration facility in houston texas  the parties have established a non-binding target date to complete installation and commissioning of the gtl pilot plant on or before december 31  2014  the purpose of the gtl pilot plant is to commercially demonstrate converting stranded natural gas resources to synthetic crude oil  bfls will operate the gtl pilot plant for the 2-year demonstration  thyssenkrupp will provide technical services and contribute a previously operating auto-thermal reformer pilot plant of proven design  atr   which will be used to generate synthesis gas feedstock for the production of synthetic crude oil  liberty will provide intellectual property and operating know-how regarding crude oil synthesis along with the relevant catalyst supply  the liberty technical team is also credited for designing the ft  fischer tropsch  reactor which will convert the synthetic gas to synthetic crude oil  the gtl pilot plant will be assembled at the houston clean energy park  which is an industrial estate owned by bfls  the houston site is located between the eagle ford natural gas field and numerous refineries 
one other proposed solution is to use a novel
for offshore conversion of gas to liquids such as         and  
two companies 
and   have technology proven to work on a commercial scale 
completed semi-commercial demonstrations of gas-to-liquids used by the company in 2011  royal dutch shell produces a diesel from natural gas in a factory in   malaysia  another shell gtl facility is the
plant in qatar  the world s largest gtl facility and there are reports that shell is looking at the feasibility of a gtl facility in louisiana  us  sasol has recently built the
facility in   qatar and together with
and
builds the
plant    in a joint venture with the
is commissioning the
in   which uses sasol technology 
on 1 february 2008  an
flew a three-hour test flight between britain and france  with one of the a380 s four
engines using a mix of 60  standard jet
and 40  gas to liquids fuel supplied by shell  the aircraft engine needed no modification to use the gtl fuel  which was designed to be mixed with normal jet fuel  the fuel used was no cleaner in
terms than standard fuel but it had local air quality benefits because the gtl portion contains no sulphur  on 12 october 2009  a
airbus a340-600 conducted the world s first commercial passenger flight using a mixture of kerosene and synthetic gtl fuel in its flight from london s
to doha 
brazilian oil company
has ordered two small experimental gtl production facilities intended to be posted at offshore oil fields too distant or deep to justify gas pipelines to onshore gtl plant  in january 2012 petrobras 
research and development centre approved for commercial deployment the technology supplied by uk-based gas-to-liquids company compactgtl 
has also completed its assessment of technology supplied by velocys 
the stg  technology is currently operating at pre-commercial scale in hillsborough  new jersey at a plant owned by alternative fuels company primus green energy  the plant produces approximately 100,000 gallons of high-quality  drop-in gasoline per year directly from natural gas  further  the company announced the findings of an independent engineers report prepared by e3 consulting  which found that stg  system and catalyst performance exceeded expectations during plant operation  the pre-commercial demonstration plant has also achieved 720 hours of continuous operation 
on march 2  2016 infra technology llc held a ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of its innovative modular 100 bpd gtl plant mark100 in wharton  texas  in close proximity to houston  the plant will be producing synthetic crude from natural gas  it will serve as a demonstration of infras proprietary technology which provides solution to one of the industrys most pressing problem  processing associated gas in an economically feasible manner
