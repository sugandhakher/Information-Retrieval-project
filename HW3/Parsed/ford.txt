 ca  1919 
a 1910   photographed in
20th century
henry ford s first attempt at a car company under his own name was the
on november 3  1901  which became the
on august 22  1902  after ford left with the rights to his name  the ford motor company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with  28,000 in cash from twelve investors  most notably
and
 who would later found
car company   during its early years  the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on
and later its
in     groups of two or three men worked on each car  assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for ford  within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the
concept  and ford soon brought much of the part production in-house in a
that seemed a better path for the era 
henry ford was 39 years old when he founded the ford motor company  which would go on to become one of the world s largest and most profitable companies  as one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world  the ford motor company has been in continuous family control for over 100 years 
after the first gasoline powered
was created in the year 1885 by
inventor
    more efficient production methods were needed to make the automobile affordable for the middle-class  which ford contributed to  for instance by introducing the first moving
in 1913 at its  
between 1903 and 1908 ford produced the models a  b  c  f  k  n  r  and s  most of which sold in the hundreds or few thousands a year  in 1908 ford introduced the mass-produced   which would sell in the millions  in 1927  ford replaced the t with the   the first car with safety glass in the windshield  ford launched the first low priced v8 engine powered car in 1932 
in an attempt to compete with general motors  mid-priced pontiac  oldsmobile and buick  ford created the mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to ford  henry ford purchased the lincoln motor company in 1922  in order to compete with such brands as cadillac and packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market 
in 1929 ford was contracted by the government of the soviet union to setup the
in russia initially producing ford model a and aas thereby playing an important role in the industrialisation of that country 
the creation of a scientific laboratory in dearborn  michigan in 1951  doing unfettered basic research  led to ford s unlikely involvement in
research  in 1964
made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or  
ford offered the lifeguard safety package from 1956  which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel  optional front  and  for the first time in a car  rear seatbelts  and an optional padded dash  ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957  and in the same year offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car 
in late 1955  ford established the continental division as a separate luxury car division  this division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous continental mark ii  at the same time  the edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year  due to limited sales of the continental and the edsel disaster  ford merged lincoln  mercury and edsel into  m-e-l   which reverted to  lincoln-mercury  after edsel s november 1959 demise 
the ford mustang was introduced in 1964  in 1965 ford introduced the seat belt reminder light 
with the 1980s  ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world  during the 1980s  ford began using the advertising slogan   have you driven a ford  lately   to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern  in 1990 and 1994 respectively  ford also acquired
and   during the mid- to late 1990s  ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles  in a booming
economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices 
with the dawn of the new century  legacy healthcare costs  higher fuel prices  and a faltering economy led to falling market shares  declining sales  and diminished profit margins  most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through  
21st century
  great-grandson of henry ford  serves as the
at the board of ford motor company 
by 2005  both ford and  s corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status  as a result of high u s  health care costs for an   soaring gasoline prices  eroding market share  and an over dependence on declining
sales  profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased  incentives   in the form of rebates or low interest financing  to offset declining demand  in the latter half of 2005  chairman bill ford asked newly appointed ford americas division president
to develop a plan to return the company to profitability  fields previewed the plan  named   at the december 7  2005 board meeting of the company and it was unveiled to the public on january 23  2006   the way forward  included resizing the company to match market realities  dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models  consolidating production lines  closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs 
ford moved to introduce a range of new vehicles  including    built on
car platforms  rather than more
chassis  in developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the
suv  ford licensed similar toyota hybrid technologies to avoid patent infringements  ford announced that it will team up with electricity supply company
 sce  to examine the future of
in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid  under the multimillion-dollar  multi-year project  ford will convert a demonstration fleet of
into plug-in hybrids  and sce will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility s electrical grid  some of the vehicles will be evaluated  in typical customer settings   according to ford

 veba  trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company s books  thereby improving its balance sheet  this arrangement took effect on january 1  2010  as a sign of its currently strong cash position  ford contributed its entire current liability  estimated at approximately us 5.5billion as of december 31  2009  to the veba in cash  and also pre-paid us 500million of its future liabilities to the fund  the agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories 
the automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of  12.7billion  and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009  however  ford surprised
in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a  750million profit  despite the gains  the company finished the year with a  2.7billion loss  largely attributed to finance restructuring at

its 1959

in 1967 
the third incarnation of the ford escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company s move from rear-wheel drive saloons to front-wheel drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector 
the fourth generation escort was produced from 1990 until 2000  although its successor  the
 had been on sale since 1998  on its launch  the focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale  and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next generation focus at the end of 2004 
the 1982
 replacement for the long-running and massively popular
and
models  was a style-setter at the time of its launch  its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy  sharp-edged cortina  and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold  a series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel drive

the rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its

south america
during much of the 20th century  ford faced protectionist government measures in south america  with the result that it built different models in different countries  without particular regard to rationalization or
inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations  in many cases  new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with  or whose factories it had acquired  for example  the
and
in brazil were originally based on
vehicles

following international condemnation of   ford divested from south africa in 1988  and sold its stake in samcor  although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company  samcor began to assemble mazdas as well  which affected its product line-up  and saw the european fords like the escort and sierra replaced by the -based laser and   ford bought a 45 per cent stake in
following the demise of apartheid in 1994  and this later became  once again  a wholly owned subsidiary  the ford motor company of southern africa  ford now sells a local sedan version of the fiesta  also built in india and mexico   and the focus  the falcon model from australia was also sold in south africa  but was dropped in 2003  while the mondeo  after briefly being assembled locally  was dropped in 2005  the mondeo has since been reintroduced  but badged as the
