intermittent jumping between two potential wells in the driven   this is an example of crisis induced intermittency 
showing intermittency  the system spends long periods close to the bright periodic orbit  occasionally moving away for phases of chaotic dynamics that cover the rest of the attractor  this is an example of pomeaumanneville dynamics 
in   intermittency is the irregular alternation of phases of apparently periodic and
dynamics  pomeaumanneville dynamics   or different forms of chaotic dynamics  crisis-induced intermittency  
pomeau and manneville described three routes to intermittency where a nearly periodic system shows irregularly spaced bursts of chaos 
these  type i  ii and iii  correspond to the approach to a   a subcritical   or an inverse   in the apparently periodic phases the behaviour is only nearly periodic  slowly drifting away from an unstable   eventually the system gets far enough away from the periodic orbit to be affected by chaotic dynamics in the rest of the   until it gets close to the orbit again and returns to the nearly periodic behaviour  since the time spent near the periodic orbit depends sensitively on how closely the system entered its vicinity  in turn determined by what happened during the chaotic period  the length of each phase is unpredictable 
another kind  on-off intermittency  occurs when a previously transversally stable chaotic attractor with dimension less than the embedding space begins to lose stability  near unstable orbits within the attractor orbits can escape into the surrounding space  producing a temporary burst before returning to the attractor 
in crisis-induced intermittency a chaotic attractor suffers a   where two or more attractors cross the boundaries of each other s   as an orbit moves through the first attractor it can cross over the boundary and become attracted to the second attractor  where it will stay until its dynamics moves it across the boundary again 
intermittent behaviour is commonly observed in fluid flows that are
or near the transition to turbulence  in highly
flows  intermittency is seen in the irregular dissipation of kinetic energy  it is also seen in the irregular alternation between turbulent and non-turbulent fluid that appear in turbulent
and other turbulent free shear flows  in
and other wall bounded shear flows  there are intermittent puffs that are central to the process of transition from laminar to turbulent flow  intermittent behavior has also been experimentally demonstrated in circuit oscillators and chemical reactions
