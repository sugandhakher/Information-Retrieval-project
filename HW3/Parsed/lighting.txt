lighting or illumination is the deliberate use of
to achieve a practical or aesthetic effect  lighting includes the use of both artificial
like lamps and light fixtures  as well as natural illumination by capturing  
 using windows  skylights  or light shelves  is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings  this can save energy in place of using artificial lighting  which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings  proper lighting can enhance task performance  improve the appearance of an area  or have positive psychological effects on occupants 
indoor lighting is usually accomplished using   and is a key part of   lighting can also be an intrinsic component of

people used primitive
to illuminate surroundings  these lamps were made from naturally occurring materials such as rocks  shells  horns and stones  were filled with   and had a
  lamps typically used animal or vegetable fats as fuel  hundreds of these lamps  hollow worked stones  have been found in the
caves in modern-day   dating to about 15,000 years ago  oily animals  birds and fish  were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick 
have been used as lighting sources 
and glass and pottery lamps were also invented 
were an early form of    
a major reduction in the cost of lighting occurred with the discovery of   in 1849  dr    a canadian geologist  devised a method where
could be distilled from   earlier coal-gas methods had been used for lighting since the 1820s  but they were expensive  gesner s kerosene was cheap  easy to produce  could be burned in existing lamps  and did not produce an offensive odor as did most whale oil  it could be stored indefinitely unlike whale oil  which would eventually spoil  the american petroleum boom began in the 1850s  by the end of the decade there were 30 kerosene plants operating in the united states  the cheaper  more efficient fuel began to drive whale oil out of the market 
was most responsible for the commercial success of kerosene  he set up a network of kerosene distilleries which would later become   thus completely abolishing the need for whale-oil lamps 
was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s  and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people  the
boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of kerosene lanterns  the next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of
in the form of
for large space and street lighting followed on by
based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting 
over time  electric lighting became ubiquitous in developed countries 
patterns disappeared  improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night  and more

fixtures  
main article 
lighting fixtures come in a wide variety of styles for various functions  the most important functions are as a holder for the light source  to provide directed light and to avoid   some are very plain and functional  while some are pieces of art in themselves  nearly any material can be used  so long as it can tolerate the excess heat and is in keeping with safety codes 
an important property of light fixtures is the
or   meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy  usually measured in
per   a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the  bulb  to the surroundings  the more
the lighting fixture is  the higher efficacy 
the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the  
for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications  the color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in
of a theoretical
emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp  an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvin  daylight is around 6400 kelvin  lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum  while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance  for critical inspection or color matching tasks  or for retail displays of food and clothing  the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect

methods  
is most common  with fixtures on or recessed in the ceiling casting light downward  this tends to be the most used method  used in both offices and homes  although it is easy to design it has dramatic problems with glare and excess energy consumption due to large number of fittings  the introduction of led lighting has greatly improved this by approx  90  when compared to a halogen downlight or spotlight  led lamps or bulbs are now available to retro fit in place of high energy consumption lamps 
is less common  often used to bounce indirect light off the ceiling and back down  it is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels  uplighting  indirect  uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces  it gives a more uniform presentation of the light output in operation  however indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface  while indirect lighting can create a diffused and shadow free light effect it can be regarded as an uneconomical lighting principle 
front lighting is also quite common  but tends to make the subject look flat as its casts almost no visible shadows  lighting from the side is the less common  as it tends to produce

design and architecture  
architectural lighting design

lighting without windows  the
in the 18th century  painted by  
lighting design as it applies to the built environment is known as  architectural lighting design   lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required  occupants of the structure  energy efficiency and cost  artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in an internal space by using
calculation  for simple installations  hand-calculations based on tabular data are used to provide an acceptable lighting design  more critical or optimized designs now routinely use mathematical modeling on a computer using software such as
which can allow an architect to quickly undertake complex calculations to review the benefit of a particular design 
in some design instances  materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect  for example dark paint tends to absorb light  making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is  whereas light paint does the opposite  in addition to paint  reflective surfaces also have an effect on lighting design 
photometric studies  
photometric studies  also sometimes referred to as  layouts  or  point by points   are often used to simulate lighting designs for projects before they are built or renovated  this enables architects  designers  and engineers to determine which configuration of lighting fixtures will deliver the amount of light needed  other parameters that can be determined are the contrast ratio between light and dark areas  in many cases these studies are referenced against
or
recommended practices for the type of application  depending on the building type  client  or safety requirements  different design aspects may be emphasized for safety or practicality  specialized software is often used to create these  which typically combine the use of two-dimensional

lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre  dance  or musical performance  and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects  stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics    the setup of stage lighting is tailored for each scene of each production  dimmers  colored filters  reflectors  lenses  motorized or manually aimed lamps  and different kinds of flood and spot lights are among the tools used by a stage lighting designer to produce the desired effects  a set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance  complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments 
motion picture and television production use many of the same tools and methods of stage lighting  especially in the early days of these industries  very high light levels were required and heat produced by lighting equipment presented substantial challenges  modern cameras require less light  and modern light sources emit less heat 
measurement  
main article 
measurement of light or
is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source  along with the colors that can be rendered by this light  the human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum  therefore photometric measurements must take the
into account when measuring the amount of useful light  the basic
unit of measurement is the
 cd   which describes the luminous intensity  all other photometric units are derived from the candela 
for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction  it describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area  and falls within a given   the si unit for luminance is
per
 cd m2   the
unit of luminance is the   which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10kcd m2  the amount of useful light emitted from a source or the
is measured in
 lm  
the
unit of
and   being the luminous power per area  is measured in   it is used in
as a measure of the intensity  as perceived by the human eye  of
that hits or passes through a surface  it is analogous to the
unit watts per square metre  but with the power at each
weighted according to the   a standardized model of human visual brightness perception  in english   lux  is used in both singular and plural 
several measurement methods have been developed to control glare resulting from indoor lighting design  the
 ugr   the visual comfort probability  and the daylight glare index are some of the most well-known methods of measurement  in addition to these new methods  four main factors influence the degree of discomfort glare  the luminance of the glare source  the solid angle of the glare source  the background luminance  and the position of the glare source in the field of view must all be taken into account 
color properties  
to define light source color properties  the lighting industry predominantly relies on two metrics 
 cct   commonly used as an indication of the apparent  warmth  or  coolness  of the light emitted by a source  and
 cri   an indication of the light sources ability to make objects appear natural 
however  these two metrics  developed in the last century  are facing increased challenges and criticisms as new types of light sources  particularly light emitting diodes  leds   become more prevalent in the market 
for example  in order to meet the expectations for good color rendering in retail applications  research suggests using the well-established cri along with another metric called gamut area index  gai   gai represents the relative separation of object colors illuminated by a light source  the greater the gai  the greater the apparent saturation or vividness of the object colors  as a result  light sources which balance both cri and gai are generally preferred over ones that have only high cri or only high gai 
light exposure  
typical measurements of light have used a dosimeter  dosimeters measure an individual s or an object s exposure to something in the environment  such as light dosimeters and ultraviolet dosimeters 
in order to specifically measure the amount of light entering the eye  personal circadian light meter called the daysimeter has been developed  this is the first device created to accurately measure and characterize light  intensity  spectrum  timing  and duration  entering the eye that affects the human body s clock 
the small  head-mounted device measures an individual s daily rest and activity patterns  as well as exposure to short-wavelength light that stimulates the circadian system  the device measures activity and light together at regular time intervals and electronically stores and logs its   the daysimeter can gather data for up to 30 days for analysis 
energy consumption  
several strategies are available to minimize energy requirements for lighting a building 
specification of illumination requirements for each given use area 
analysis of lighting quality to ensure that adverse components of lighting  for example  glare or incorrect   are not biasing the design 
integration of space planning and interior architecture  including choice of interior surfaces and room geometries  to lighting design 
design of time of day use that does not expend unnecessary energy 
selection of
and lamp types that reflect best available technology for  
training of building occupants to use lighting equipment in most efficient manner 
maintenance of lighting systems to minimize energy wastage 
use of natural light
some big box stores were being built from 2006 on with numerous plastic bubble skylights  in many cases completely obviating the need for interior artificial lighting for many hours of the day 
in countries where indoor lighting of simple dwellings is a significant cost      plastic water-filled transparent drink bottles fitted through the roof  provide the equivalent of a 40- to 60-watt incandescent bulb each during daylight 
can help reduce the power requested by individuals to the main power supply  load shedding can be done on an individual level  at a building level  or even at a regional level 
specification of illumination requirements is the basic concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task  clearly  much less light is required to illuminate a hallway compared to that needed for a
work station  generally speaking  the
expended is proportional to the design illumination level  for example  a lighting level of 400
might be chosen for a work environment involving meeting rooms and conferences  whereas a level of 80 lux could be selected for building hallways  if the hallway standard simply emulates the conference room needs  then much more energy will be consumed than is needed  unfortunately  most of the lighting standards even today have been specified by industrial groups who manufacture and sell lighting  so that a historical commercial bias exists in designing most building lighting  especially for office and industrial settings 
lighting control systems  
main article 
lighting control systems reduce energy usage and cost by helping to provide light only when and where it is needed  lighting control systems typically incorporate the use of time schedules  occupancy control  and photocell control  i e    some systems also support
and will automatically dim or turn off lights to take advantage of
incentives  lighting control systems are sometimes incorporated into larger  
many newer control systems are using
open standards  such as    which provides benefits including easier installation  no need to run control wires  and interoperability with other standards-based building control systems  e g  security  
in response to
technology 
systems have been developed to further reduce energy consumption  these technologies are helpful  but they do have their downfalls  many times  rapid and frequent switching of the lights on and off can occur  particularly during unstable weather conditions or when daylight levels are changing around the switching illuminance  not only does this disturb occupants  it can also reduce lamp life  a variation of this technology is the  differential switching or dead-band  photoelectric control which has multiple illuminances it switches from so as not to disturb occupants as much 
occupancy sensors to allow operation for whenever someone is within the area being scanned can control lighting  when motion can no longer be detected  the lights shut off  passive infrared sensors react to changes in heat  such as the pattern created by a moving person  the control must have an unobstructed view of the building area being scanned  doors  partitions  stairways  etc  will block motion detection and reduce its effectiveness  the best applications for passive infrared occupancy sensors are open spaces with a clear view of the area being scanned  ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return  a break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control  ultrasonic sensors can see around obstructions and are best for areas with cabinets and shelving  restrooms  and open areas requiring 360-degree coverage  some occupancy sensors utilize both passive infrared and ultrasonic technology  but are usually more expensive  they can be used to control one lamp  one fixture or many fixtures 
daylighting  
main article 
daylighting is the oldest method of interior lighting  daylighting is simply designing a space to use as much natural light as possible  this decreases energy consumption and costs  and requires less heating and cooling from the building  daylighting has also been proven to have positive effects on patients in hospitals as well as work and school performance  due to a lack of information that indicate the likely energy savings  daylighting schemes are not yet popular among most buildings 
solid-state lighting  
main article 
in recent years
 leds  are becoming increasingly efficient leading to an extraordinary increase in the use of   in many situations  controlling the light emission of leds may be done most effectively by using the principles of  
health effects  
main articles      and
it is valuable to provide the correct light intensity and color spectrum for each task or environment  otherwise  energy not only could be wasted but
can lead to adverse health and psychological effects 
beyond the energy factors being considered  it is important not to over-design illumination  lest adverse health effects such as
frequency  stress  and increased
be induced by the higher lighting levels  in addition  glare or excess light can decrease worker efficiency 
analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting  but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used  not only will greater reliance on natural light reduce energy consumption  but will favorably impact human health and performance  new studies have shown that the performance of students is influenced by the time and duration of daylight in their regular schedules 
to incorporate the right types of light at the right time of day for the right duration may improve student performance and well-being  similarly  designing lighting systems that maximize the right amount of light at the appropriate time of day
may help relieve symptoms of alzheimer s disease  the human circadian system is entrained to a 24-hour light-dark pattern that mimics the earths natural light dark pattern  when those patterns are disrupted  they disrupt the natural circadian cycle 
may lead to numerous health problems including breast cancer      and other ailments 
a study conducted in 1972 and 1981  documented by robert ulrich  surveyed 23 surgical patients assigned to rooms looking out on a natural scene  the study concluded that patients assigned to rooms with windows allowing lots of natural light had shorter postoperative hospital stays  received fewer negative evaluative comments in nurses notes  and took fewer potent analegesics than 23 matched patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick wall  this study suggests that due to the nature of the scenery and daylight exposure was indeed healthier for patients as opposed to those exposed to little light from the brick wall  in addition to increased work performance  proper usage of windows and daylighting crosses the boundaries between pure aesthetics and overall health 
alison jing xu  assistant professor of management at the
and aparna labroo of
conducted a series of studies analyzing the correlation between lighting and human emotion  the researchers asked participants to rate a number of things such as  the spiciness of chicken-wing sauce  the aggressiveness of a fictional character  how attractive someone was  their feelings about specific words  and the taste of two juicesall under different lighting conditions  in their study  they found that both positive and negative human emotions are felt more intensely in bright light  professor xu stated   we found that on sunny days depression-prone people actually become more depressed   they also found that dim light makes people make more rational decisions and settle negotiations easier  in the dark  emotions are slightly suppressed  however  emotions are intensified in the bright light 
environmental issues  
compact fluorescent lamps  
 cfls  use less power than an
to supply the same amount of light  however they contain
which is a disposal hazard  due to the ability to reduce electricity consumption  many organizations encourage the adoption of cfls  some electric utilities and local governments have subsidized cfls or provided them free to customers as a means of reducing electricity demand  for a given light output  cfls use between one fifth and one quarter the power of an equivalent incandescent lamp  unlike incandescent lamps cfls need a little time to warm up and reach full brightness  not all cfls are suitable for dimming 
led lamps  
led lamps have been advocated as the newest and best environmental lighting method  according to the energy saving trust  led lamps use only 10  power compared to a standard incandescent bulb  where compact fluorescent lamps use 20  and energy saving halogen lamps 70   the lifetime is also much longer up to 50,000 hours  a downside is still the initial cost  which is higher than that of compact fluorescent lamps  recent findings about the increased use of blue-white leds may be a policy mistake  the wide-scale adoption of leds will reap energy savings but the energy savings may be compromising human health and ecosystems  the american medical association warned on the use of high blue content white leds in street lighting  due to their higher impact on human health and environment  compared to low blue content light sources  e g  high pressure sodium  pc amber leds  and low cct leds  
light pollution  
main article 
is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs  houses  and buildings  polluting light is often wasted light involving unnecessary energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions  light pollution is described as artificial light that is excessive or intrudes where it is not wanted  well-designed lighting sends light only where it is needed without scattering it elsewhere  poorly designed lighting can also compromise safety  for example  glare creates safety issues around buildings by causing very sharp shadows  temporarily blinding passersby making them vulnerable to would-be assailants  the ecologic effects of artificial light have been documented  the world health organization in 2007
issued a report that noted the effects of bright light on flora and fauna  sea turtle hatchlings  frogs during mating season and the migratory patterns of birds  the american medical association in 2012 issued a warning that extended exposure to light at night increases the risk of some cancers  two studies in israel from 2008 have yielded some additional findings about a possible correlation between artificial light at night and certain cancers 
military use

from a military standpoint  lighting is a critical part of the battlefield conditions  shadows are good places to hide  while bright areas are more exposed  it is often beneficial to fight with the
or other light source behind you  giving your enemy disturbing
and partially hiding your own movements in   if natural light is not present
and
can be used  however the use of light may disclose your own hidden position and modern warfare have seen increased use of
