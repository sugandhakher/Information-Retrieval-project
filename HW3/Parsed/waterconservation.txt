united states postal stamp advocating water conservation 
water conservation includes all the policies  strategies and activities made to manage
as a sustainable resource  to protect the water environment  and to meet current and future human demand  population  household size  and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used  factors such as
have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in
and agricultural  
the goals of water conservation efforts include 
ensuring availability of water for future generations where the withdrawal of fresh water from an ecosystem does not exceed its natural replacement rate 
as water pumping  delivery and waste water treatment facilities consume a significant amount of energy  in some regions of the world over 15  of total electricity consumption is devoted to water management 
where minimizing human water use helps to preserve freshwater habitats for local wildlife and migrating waterfowl  but also

strategies  
the key activities that benefit water conservation are as follows 
any beneficial deduction in water loss  use and waste of resources 
avoiding any damage to  
improving
practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water 
social solutions  
system in
water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level  by either municipal
or regional governments  common strategies include public
campaigns  tiered water rates  charging progressively higher prices as water use increases   or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing  cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of
or
in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage 
one fundamental conservation goal is universal metering  the prevalence of residential
varies significantly worldwide  recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30  of uk households  and about 61  of urban canadian homes  as of 2001   although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings  the u s 
estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent  in addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use  metering is also an important way to identify and localize   water metering would benefit society in the long run it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system  as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come  one would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges  this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by public  domestic and manufacturing services 
some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers  in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70  of the world s fresh water use  the agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically  and water subsidies are common  conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force
to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques 
new technology poses a few new options for consumers  features such and full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste  also available in our modern world is shower heads that help reduce wasting water  old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute  all new fixtures available are said to use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage 
household applications  
the home water works website contains useful information on household water conservation  contrary to popular view  experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers 
water-saving technology for the home includes 
low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy
and   these have a dramatic impact in the developed world  as conventional western
use large volumes of water
created by
includes two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water  dual flush toilets use up to 67  less water than conventional toilets
  which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain  wetting effectiveness  while using less water  an additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes
where toilets use sea water or non-purified water
or recycling systems  allowing 
reuse of
for flushing toilets or watering gardens
recycling of wastewater through

high-efficiency
weather-based irrigation controllers
that shut off water when it is not being used  instead of letting a hose run 
low flow taps in wash basins
covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water  energy and chemical costs 
is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet  it automates the use of faucets without the use of hands 
commercial applications  
many water-saving devices  such as low-flush toilets  that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving  other water-saving technology for businesses includes 
or foot-operated taps  which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom
pressurized waterbrooms  which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks
film processor re-circulation systems
conductivity controllers
water-saving   for use in hospitals and health care facilities

agricultural applications  
overhead irrigation 
design
for crop irrigation  optimal water efficiency means minimizing losses due to  
or subsurface drainage while maximizing production  an
in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements    the oldest and most common type  is often very uneven in distribution  as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts    using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers  has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern 
is the most expensive and least-used type  but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses  however  drip irrigation is increasingly affordable  especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates  there are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation 
as changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking  conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system  this may include chiseling compacted soils  creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff  and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules  usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system  the 2011 unep green economy report notes that   i mproved soil organic matter from the use of green manures  mulching  and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains   which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season
