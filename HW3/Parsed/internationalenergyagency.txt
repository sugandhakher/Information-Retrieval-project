the international energy agency  iea     agence internationale de l nergie  is a -based autonomous intergovernmental organization established in the framework of the
 oecd  in 1974 in the wake of the   the iea was initially dedicated to responding to physical disruptions in the supply of   as well as serving as an information source on statistics about the international oil market and other
sectors 
the iea acts as a policy adviser to its member states  but also works with non-member countries  especially     and   the agency s mandate has broadened to focus on the  3es  of effectual energy policy    economic development  and environmental protection  the latter has focused on mitigating climate change  the iea has a broad role in promoting
sources  including renewable energy   rational energy policies  and multinational energy technology co-operation 
iea member countries are required to maintain total oil stock levels equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year s net imports  at the end of july 2009  iea member countries held a combined stockpile of almost 4.3 billion
 680,000,000 m3  of oil 
on 1 september 2015 
took office as the new executive director  succeeding in this position former dutch minister of economic affairs

history  
the iea was established to meet the industrial countries  energy organization needs in the wake of the 19731974 oil crisis  although the oecd had structures such as the council  the executive committee  the oil committee  and the energy committee that could potentially deal with energy questions  it could not respond effectively to the crisis  the oecd had adopted the oil apportionment decision  c 72 201 final    laying out procedures to be carried out in the event of an oil supply emergency in europe  but these procedures were not implemented during the crisis  in addition  the oecd had adopted recommendations on oil stockpiling in europe  but due to their limited scope  these measures could have only a limited role in an oil supply emergency 
establishment of the new organization was proposed by
in his address to the
in
on 12 december 1973  also in december 1973  at the summit of the
in   danish prime minister   who chaired the summit  declared that the summit found it  useful to study with other oil-consuming countries within the framework of the oecd ways of dealing with the common short and long term energy problems of consumer countries  
at the washington energy conference on 1113 february 1974  the ministers of thirteen principal oil consumer countries stated  the need for a comprehensive action program to deal with all facets of the world energy situation by cooperative measures  in so doing they will build on the work of the oecd  
while creating a new energy organization  it was decided to utilize the framework of the oecd  as it had experience in dealing with oil and other energy questions  had expertise in economic analysis and statistics  had established staff  physical facilities  legal status and privileges and immunities  and was the principal organization of the industrial countries  however  the oecd has a rule of unanimity  and not all member states were ready to participate  therefore  instead of an integrated approach  an autonomous approach was chosen 
the iea was created on 18 november 1974 by the agreement on an international energy program  i e p  agreement  
during its history  the iea has intervened in oil markets three times by releasing oil stocks  in 1991 during the   in 2005 by releasing 2 million barrels per day  32010 3m3 d  for a month after
affected us production  and most recently in 2011 to offset continued disruption to oil supplies as a result of the  
in april 2001  the iea  in collaboration with five other international organisations  apec  eurostat  olade  opec  unsd  launched the joint oil data exercise  which in 2005 became the
 jodi  
in june 2014 in its world energy outlook report  the iae warned us 48 trillion in investment and credible long term policy planning would be required between 2014 and 2035 to secure sufficient energy supplies for that period   the reliability and sustainability of our future energy system depends on investment  but this won t materialize unless there are credible policy frameworks in place as well as stable access to long-term sources of finance  neither of these conditions should be taken for granted   van der hoeven said in a statement accompanying the report 
member states  
only the
member states can become members of the iea  except for         and   all oecd member states are members of the iea  in 2014  estonia joined the iea and became its 29th member 
critics  
ahead of the launch of the 2009   the british daily newspaper   referring to an unidentified senior iea official  alleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of
under pressures from the usa  according to a second unidentified former senior iea official it was  imperative not to anger the americans  and that the world has already entered the  peak oil zone  
the guardian also referred to a team of scientists from
in sweden who studied the 2008 world energy outlook and concluded the forecasts of the iea were unattainable  according to their peer-reviewed report  oil production in 2030 would not exceed 75 million barrels per day  11.910 6m3 d  while the iea forecasts a production of 105 million barrels per day  16.710 6m3 d   the lead author of the report  dr  kjell aleklett  has claimed that iea s reports are  political documents  
the anticorruption
wrote in its report heads in the sand that  global witness  analysis demonstrates that the agency continues to retain an overly-optimistic  and therefore misleading  view about potential future oil production   according to global witness   the agency s over-confidence  despite credible data  external analysis and underlying fundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach  has had a disastrous global impact  
in the past  the iea has been criticized by environmental groups for underplaying the role of renewable energy technologies in favor of nuclear and fossil-fuels  in 2009 
stated that the iea has consistently underestimated the potential for renewable energy alternatives 
the
 ewg   a coalition of scientists and politicians which analyses official energy industry predictions  claims that the iea has had an institutional bias towards traditional energy sources and has been using  misleading data  to undermine the case for   such as wind and solar  a 2008 ewg report compares iea projections about the growth of
capacity and finds that it has consistently underestimated the amount of energy the
can deliver 
for example  in 1998  the iea predicted global wind electricity generation would total 47.4 gw by 2020  but ewg s report states that this level was reached by the end of 2004  the report also said that the iea has not learned the lesson of previous underestimates  and last year net additions of wind power globally were four times greater than the average iea estimate from its 1995-2004 predictions 
amid discontent from across the renewables sector at the iea s performance as a global energy watchdog  the
was formed on january 26  2009  the aim is to have the agency fully operational by 2010 with an initial annual budget of 25m 
iea bioenergy  
was set up in 1978 by the international energy agency  iea  with the aim of improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programmes in bioenergy research  development and deployment 
the international energy agency acts as energy policy advisor to 28 member countries plus the european commission  in their effort to ensurereliable  affordable  and clean energy for their citizens  founded during the oil crisis of 1973-74  the ieas initial role was to co-ordinate measures in times of oil supply emergencies  as energy markets have changed  so has the iea  its mandate has broadened to incorporate the three es of balanced energy policy making  energy security  economic development  and environmental protection  current work focuses on climate change policies  market reform  energy technology collaboration and outreach to the rest of the world  especially major producers and consumers of energy like china  india  russia and the opec countries 
activities are set up under implementing agreements  these are independent bodies operating in a framework provided by the iea  there are 42 currently active implementing agreements  one of which is iea bioenergy 
twenty two countries plus the european commission participate in iea bioenergy  australia  austria  belgium  brazil  canada  croatia  denmark  european commission  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  japan  korea  netherlands  new zealand  norway  south africa  sweden  switzerland  united kingdom  and usa 
iea bioenergy tasks  
the work of iea bioenergy is structured in a number of tasks  which have well defined objectives  budgets  and time frames  the collaboration which earlier was focused on research  development and demonstration is now increasingly also emphasising deployment on a large-scale and worldwide  each participating country pays a modest financial contribution toward administrative requirements  shares the costs of managing the tasks and provides in-kind contributions to fund participation of national personnel in the tasks  the scope of the work undertaken within iea bioenergy is shown in the graphic 
each task is led by one of the participating countries  operating agent  with technical effort co-ordinated by a task leader  the work is directed by the executive committee  for the period 2013-2015  there are 10 tasks  all of the tasks have a common duration of three years 
current tasks 
task 32 biomass combustion and co-firing
task 33 thermal gasification of biomass
task 34 pyrolysis of biomass
task 36 integrating energy recovery into solid waste management
task 37 energy from biogas
task 38 climate change effects of biomass and bioenergy systems
task 40 sustainable international bioenergy trade  securing supply and demand
task 42 biorefining sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable biobased products and bioenergy
task 43 biomass feedstocks for energy markets
promotion of renewable energy - photovoltaic power systems programme  
the iea photovoltaic power systems programme  pvps  is one of the collaborative r d agreements established within the iea and  since its establishment in 1993  the pvps participants have been conducting a variety of joint projects in the application of photovoltaic conversion of solar energy into electricity 
in 2011  iea chief economist
said the current us 409 billion equivalent of fossil fuel subsidies are encouraging a wasteful use of energy  and that the cuts in subsidies is the biggest policy item that would help renewable energies get more market share and reduce
emissions 
in november 2011  an iea report entitled
said  renewable energy technology is becoming increasingly cost competitive and growth rates are in line to meet levels required of a sustainable energy future   the report also said  subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits   the renewable electricity sector has  grown rapidly in the past five years and now provides nearly 20 percent of the world s power generation   the iea said  the iea s report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand   a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances  in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support   the iea said  and added that  cost reductions in critical technologies  such as wind and solar  are set to continue  
in 2011  the international energy agency said that 
the development of affordable  inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits  it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous  inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource  enhance   reduce pollution  lower the costs of mitigating   and keep
prices lower than otherwise  these advantages are global  hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments  they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared  
for the first time in 2012  an annual medium-term report which analyses the renewable energy sector will be published by the iea  this publication on renewable energy -  which is now the fastest growing sector of the energy mix and accounts for almost a fifth of all electricity produced worldwide - will join annual medium-term reports on oil  gas and coal  which the iea already produces   with this report   renewable energy takes its rightful seat at the table alongside the other major energy sources  
iea-pvps members
as of 2015  there are 28 members  including australia  austria  belgium  canada  china  denmark  france  germany  israel  italy  japan  korea  malaysia  mexico  netherlands  norway  portugal  spain  sweden  switzerland  thailand  turkey  united states  as well as   european union  international copper association 
and  
development and promotion of energy storage technologies  
the iea s energy conservation through energy storage  eces  programme has completed 20 developmental annexes covering
as sensible heat  or cold   as well as storage of latent heat and electrical energy  six other annexes are on-going and three are in planning 
the eces programme has held triennial global energy conferences since 1981  the conferences originally focused exclusively on stes  but now that those technologies are mature and other kinds of energy storage technology are now also included  since 1985 each conference has had  stock   for storage  at the end of its name  e g  ecostock  thermastock  they are held at various locations around the world  most recent was innostock 2012  the 12th international conference on thermal energy storage  in lleida  spain  greenstock 2015 will be held in beijing 
carbon capture  
iea promotes reduction of
emissions for both conventional fossil-fuel ccs and for bioenergy with ccs  beccs  by working with member and partner nations on development of cost effective and efficient international and national energy policies including carbon capture and storage  ccs   trading mechanisms and clean low-carbon technologies  the 2012 iea report entitled  a policy strategy for carbon capture and storage  argues for comprehensive policy mechanisms that include setting a market price on co2 emissions as key to reduction of co2 emissions    i n contrast to renewable energy or applications of energy efficiency  ccs generates no revenue  nor other market benefits  so long as there is no price on co2 emissions  it is both costly to install and  once in place  has increased operating costs  effective  well-designed policy support is essential in overcoming these barriers and the subsequent deployment of ccs technology  
energy efficiency  
main article 
at the heiligendamm summit in june 2007  the
acknowledged an
proposal for an international initiative on
tabled in march 2007  and agreed to explore  together with the international energy agency  the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally  a year later  on 8 june 2008  the g8 countries  china  india  south korea and the european community decided to establish the international partnership for energy efficiency cooperation  at the energy ministerial meeting hosted by japan in the frame of the 2008 g8 presidency  in aomori
