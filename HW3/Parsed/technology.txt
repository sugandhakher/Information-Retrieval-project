definition and usage
the spread of paper and printing to the west  as in this   helped
and
communicate their ideas easily  leading to the   an example of technology as cultural force 
the use of the term  technology  has changed significantly over the last 200 years  before the 20th century  the term was uncommon in english  and usually referred to the description or study of the   the term was often connected to technical education  as in the
 chartered in 1861  
the term  technology  rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the   the term s meanings changed in the early 20th century when american social scientists  beginning with   translated ideas from the german concept of
into  technology   in german and other european languages  a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english  which usually translates both terms as  technology   by the 1930s   technology  referred not only to the study of the
but to the industrial arts themselves 
in 1937  the american sociologist read bain wrote that  technology includes all tools  machines  utensils  weapons  instruments  housing  clothing  communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them   bain s definition remains common among scholars today  especially social scientists  but equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science  especially among scientists and engineers  although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition  more recently  scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of  technique  to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason  as in  s work on
 techniques de soi  
dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions  the
offers a definition of the term   the use of science in industry  engineering  etc   to invent useful things or to solve problems  and  a machine  piece of equipment  method  etc   that is created by technology     in her 1989  real world of technology  lecture  gave another definition of the concept  it is  practice  the way we do things around here   the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology  or to refer to
or just   rather than technology as a whole    in   defines technology in two ways  as  the pursuit of life by means other than life   and as  organized inorganic matter  
technology can be most broadly defined as the entities  both material and immaterial  created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value  in this usage  technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems  it is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools  such as a
or wooden   or more complex machines  such as a
or   tools and machines need not be material  virtual technology  such as
and   fall under this definition of technology 
defines technology in a similarly broad way as  a means to fulfill a human purpose  
the word  technology  can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques  in this context  it is the current state of humanity s knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products  to solve problems  fulfill needs  or satisfy wants  it includes technical methods  skills  processes  techniques  tools and raw materials  when combined with another term  such as  medical technology  or  space technology   it refers to the state of the respective field s knowledge and tools    technology  refers to the
available to humanity in any field 
the invention of integrated circuits and the
 here  an
chip from 1971  led to the modern  
technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture  additionally  technology is the application of math  science  and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known  a modern example is the rise of
technology  which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures  the rise of
has at its basis the development of the
and the   not all technology enhances culture in a creative way  technology can also help facilitate
and war via tools such as guns  as a cultural activity  technology predates both
and   each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor 
science  engineering and technology

the distinction between science  engineering  and technology is not always clear 
is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation  technologies are not usually exclusively products of science  because they have to satisfy requirements such as     and  
engineering is the
process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means  often  but not always  using results and techniques from science  the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge  including scientific  engineering      and
knowledge  to achieve some practical result 
technology is often a consequence of science and engineering  although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields  for example  science might study the flow of
in
by using already-existing tools and knowledge  this new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as     and other forms of advanced technology  in this sense  scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists  the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference 
the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists  historians  and policymakers in the late 20th century  in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science  in the immediate wake of   for example  it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply  applied science  and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time  an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in  s treatise on postwar science policy  sciencethe endless frontier   new products  new industries  and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature    this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research   in the late-1960s  however  this view came under direct attack  leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks  initiatives resisted by the scientific community   the issue remains contentious  though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research

the discovery and utilization of   a simple

an array of neolithic artifacts  including bracelets  axe heads  chisels  and polishing tools
man s technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the

was a major advance that allowed
on a large scale to create farms 
fed larger populations  and the transition to
allowed simultaneously raising more children  as infants no longer needed to be carried  as
ones must  additionally  children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the
economy 
with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in   what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities  such as   and the first civilizations  such as   is not specifically known  however  the emergence of increasingly
social structures and specialized labor  of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures  and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as   are all thought to have played a role

times  about 10 ka   native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts  but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires  eventually  the working of metals led to the discovery of

meanwhile  humans were learning to harness other forms of energy  the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat  the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat that dates back to the 8th millenium bce  from prehistoric times  egyptians probably used the power of the annual
to irrigate their lands  gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and  catch  basins  similarly  the early peoples of mesopotamia  the sumerians  learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes  however  more extensive use of wind and water  and even human  power required another invention 
according to archaeologists  the

the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war  it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads  fast  rotary  potters  wheels enabled early

and  
philosophy
technicism
generally 
is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies  taken to an extreme  technicism  reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality  to resolve all problems with the use of scientific-technological methods and tools   in other words  human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology  some  such as   connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher  
optimism

optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as
and   which view
as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition  in these ideologies  technological development is morally good  some critics see these ideologies as examples of
and
and fear the notion of
and
which they support  some have described
as a techno-optimist 
skepticism and critics
see also        and
smashing a power loom in 1812
on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like
and   who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed  they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health 
many  such as the
and prominent philosopher   hold serious  although not entirely  deterministic reservations about technology  see      according to heidegger scholars
and charles spinosa   heidegger does not oppose technology  he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that  in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or  what comes to the same thing  to rebel helplessly against it   indeed  he promises that  when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology  we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim   what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow  
some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as  s    s   and  s   in   faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology  more recently  modern works of science fiction such as those by
and
and films such as
and
project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology s impact on human society and identity 
the late cultural critic
distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called  technopolies   societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices  values and world-views 
has written about technology s impact on practices of
and democratic culture  suggesting that technology can be construed as  1  an object of political debate   2  a means or medium of discussion  and  3  a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship  as a setting for democratic culture  barney suggests that technology tends to make
questions  including the question of what a good life consists in  nearly impossible  because they already give an answer to the question  a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology 
has also
about the dangers of new technology  such as       and   he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings  including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature  these concerns are shared by other philosophers  scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues  e g        and   
another prominent critic of technology is   who has published books on the internet and what computers still can t do 
another  more infamous anti-technological treatise is   written by
 aka the   and printed in several major newspapers  and later books  as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure 
appropriate technology

and
the notion of   however  was developed in the 20th century  e g   see the work of
and of   to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized
or parts or skills imported from elsewhere  the
movement emerged in part due to this concern 
optimism and skepticism in the 21st century
this article mainly focusses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries 
the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face        what s the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem 
bernstein  jared   its not a skills gap thats holding wages down  its the weak economy  among other things   in   october 2014
in his article    a senior fellow at the   questions the widespread idea that   and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing
problem  his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism  basically  he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning
and eroding wages 
he uses two main arguments to defend his point  first of all  because of recent technological advances  an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs  yet  scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved  indeed  threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that  requires flexibility judgment and common sense  remain hard to be replaced by  second  studies have not defined clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades 
therefore  according to   instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and eroding wages  one needs to worry more about  bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand  trade  income and opportunity  
complex technological systems
pointed out that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems  we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently  what is the difference between a
or a
and cooking machines such as an
or a   can we consider all of them  only a part of them or none of them as technologies 
technology is often considered too narrowly  according to
 technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity  this definition emphasizing on creativity avoids unbounded definition that may mistakenly include cooking technologies  but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems 
yet  because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies  hughes argued that     and
often have believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want  they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned  for instance 
particularly challenges two concepts  internet-centrism and solutionism  internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces  solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet  in fact  technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations  according to  s critique of morozov s theory  to ignore it will lead to unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address 
and
precisely discussed the multivalent effects of technology 
therefore  recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed  especially in cases dealing with
and health issues 
continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers new comprehension of their role  such an approach of technology and science   require  technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently   they have to consider themselves as  collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions  
competitiveness
technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function  the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology  and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage 
technology-based planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii  e g         and it what was used to transform the us into a   it was not economic-based planning

was initiated in the
to determine the source of declining us economic and military competitiveness  project socrates concluded that technology exploitation is the foundation of all
and that declining us competitiveness was from decision-making in the private and public sectors switching from technology exploitation  technology-based planning  to money exploitation  economic-based planning  at the end of world war ii 
project socrates determined that to rebuild us competitiveness  decision making throughout the us had to readopt technology-based planning  project socrates also determined that countries like china and india had continued executing technology-based  while the us took its detour into economic-based  planning  and as a result had considerably advanced the process and were using it to build themselves into superpowers  to rebuild us competitiveness the us decision-makers needed to adopt a form of technology-based planning that was far more advanced than that used by china and india 
project socrates determined that technology-based planning makes an evolutionary leap forward every few hundred years and the next evolutionary leap  the automated innovation revolution  was poised to occur  in the automated innovation revolution the process for determining how to acquire and utilize technology for a competitive advantage  which includes r d  is automated so that it can be executed with unprecedented speed  efficiency and agility 
project socrates developed the means for automated innovation so that the us could lead the automated innovation revolution in order to rebuild and maintain the country s economic competitiveness for many generations

the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans  these include primates such as   some
communities  and   considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control  we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams  or bees and their honeycombs 
the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus   however  the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans  for example  researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging  some of the tools used include leaf sponges  termite fishing probes
