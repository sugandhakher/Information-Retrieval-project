types of compressors  
the main types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below 
positive displacement  
reciprocating compressors  
main article 
a motor-driven six-cylinder reciprocating compressor that can operate with two  four or six cylinders 
reciprocating compressors use
driven by a crankshaft  they can be either stationary or portable  can be single or multi-staged  and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines  small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30  hp  are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty  larger reciprocating compressors well over 1,000hp  750kw  are commonly found in large industrial and petroleum applications  discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure   18000 psi or 180 mpa   in certain applications  such as air compression  multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available  and are typically larger  and more costly than comparable rotary units  another type of reciprocating compressor is the swash plate compressor  which uses pistons moved by a swash plate mounted on a shaft  see   
household  home workshop  and smaller job site compressors are typically reciprocating compressors 1hp or less with an attached receiver tank 
ionic liquid piston compressor  
main article 
an   ionic compressor or ionic liquid piston pump is a
based on an
piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal  
rotary screw compressors  
diagram of a rotary screw compressor
main article 
rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive-displacement
to force the gas into a smaller space  these are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable  their application can be from 3 horsepower  2.2kw  to over 1,200 horsepower  890kw  and from low pressure to moderately high pressure   1,200psi or 8.3mpa  
rotary screw compressors are commercially produced in oil flooded  water flooded and dry type  the efficiency of rotary compressors depends on the air drier    and the selection of air drier is always 1.5 times volumetric delivery of the compressor   
rotary vane compressors  
eccentric rotary-vane pump
see also 
rotary vane compressors consist of a rotor with a number of blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor  the rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape  as the rotor turns  blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing  thus  a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades  rotary vane compressors are  with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies 
with suitable port connections  the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump  they can be either stationary or portable  can be single or multi-staged  and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines  dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures  e g   2bar or 200kpa or 29psi  for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about 13bar  1,300kpa  190psi  in a single stage  a rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor 
rotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90  
rolling piston

scroll compressors  
mechanism of a scroll pump
main article 
a scroll compressor  also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump  uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to
or compress
such as
and   the vane geometry may be     or hybrid curves  they operate more smoothly  quietly  and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range 
often  one of the scrolls is fixed  while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating  thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls 
due to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll  these compressors have a very high volumetric efficiency 
this type of compressor was used as the
on volkswagen g60 and g40 engines in the early 1990s 
diaphragm compressors  
main article 
a diaphragm compressor  also known as a membrane compressor  is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor  the compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane  instead of an intake element  the back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism  only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed 
the degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment  generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking  but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures  rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion  but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications  and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs 
diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas    as well as in a number of other applications 
a three-stage diaphragm compressor
the photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to 6,000psi  41mpa  for use in a prototype
and
 cng  fueling station built in downtown
by the
company  an electric utilities company  
were used to compress the   the reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by  
the prototype
station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety  environmental and building codes in phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas 
dynamic  
dynamic compressors depend upon the
and
of a fluid 
air bubble compressor  
also known as a   a mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water  the weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber  a submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake  an outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface  a facility on this principle was built on the
at ragged shutes near
in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines 
centrifugal compressors  
a single stage centrifugal compressor
main article 
centrifugal compressors use a rotating disk or
in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller  increasing the velocity of the gas  a diffuser  divergent duct  section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy  they are primarily used for continuous  stationary service in industries such as  
and
plants and
plants  their application can be from 100 horsepower  75kw  to thousands of horsepower  with multiple staging  they can achieve high output pressures greater than 10,000psi  69mpa  
many large
operations  like   use this type of compressor  they are also used in internal combustion engines as
and   centrifugal compressors are used in small
or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines 
diagonal or mixed-flow compressors  
diagonal or mixed-flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors  but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor  the diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction   
axial-flow compressors  
an animation of an axial compressor 
main article 
axial-flow compressors are dynamic rotating compressors that use arrays of fan-like
to progressively compress a fluid  they are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required 
the arrays of airfoils are set in rows  usually as pairs  one rotating and one stationary  the rotating airfoils  also known as blades or rotors  accelerate the fluid  the stationary airfoils  also known as stators or vanes  decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid  preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage  axial compressors are almost always multi-staged  with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial   beyond about 5 stages or a 4 1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles  known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators   the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor  known as interstage bleed  and being split into more than one rotating assembly  known as twin spools  for example  
axial compressors can have high efficiencies  around 90 
at their design conditions  however  they are relatively expensive  requiring a large number of components  tight tolerances and high quality materials  axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large
engines  natural gas pumping stations  and some chemical plants 
hermetically sealed  open  or semi-hermetic  
a small hermetically sealed compressor in a common consumer
or
typically has a rounded steel outer shell permanently welded shut  which seals operating gases inside the system  there is no route for gases to leak  such as around motor shaft seals  on this model  the plastic top section is part of an auto-defrost system that uses motor heat to evaporate the water 
compressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic  open  or semi-hermetic  to describe how the compressor and
drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed  the industry name for a hermetic is hermetically sealed compressor  while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a semi-hermetic compressor 
in hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors  the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated  and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system  the motor is designed to operate in  and be cooled by  the refrigerant gas being compressed 
the difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic  is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair  if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit  a semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components 
the primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system  open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure  and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties 
an open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases  open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals  if it is not operated frequently enough  the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates  and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged  by comparison  a hermetic system can sit unused for years  and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure 
the disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained  and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails  a further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems  thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced  typically  hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared to the value of the device  and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device 
an advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources  such as an
or   however  open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally maintenance-free throughout the life of the system  since some gas leakage will occur over time 
thermodynamics of gas compression  
isentropic compressor  
a compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and   thus an
steady state device  meaning the change in
is 0  by defining the compression cycle as   an ideal efficiency for the process can be attained  and the ideal compressor performance can be compared to the actual performance of the machine  isotropic compression as used in
ptc 10 code refers to a reversible  adiabatic compression process

- this model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process  in this cycle  internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression  isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface  a small gas volume  or a long time scale  i e   a small power level   compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression  however  with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable  for example  unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers  you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression

when evaluated  the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work 
- this model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy  heat  to the compressor s components  this assumes that heat may enter or leave the system  and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure  usually useful work  and increased temperature above adiabatic  usually losses due to cycle efficiency   compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent  adiabatic  vs  actual  polytropic   polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0  a constant-pressure process  and infinity  a constant volume process   for the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process  the value of n will be between 1 and k 
staged compression  
in the case of centrifugal compressors  commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than a 3.5 to 1 in any one stage  for a typical gas   since compression raises the temperature  the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal  the inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in  
in the case of small reciprocating compressors  the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the
of a two or more stage compressor 
because rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression  they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio  for instance  in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages  if each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1  the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure  7  7  7   343     343atm or 34.8 or 5.04 
drive motors  
there are many options for the motor that powers the compressor 
gas
power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of  
or
are possible for large compressors 
are cheap and quiet for static compressors  small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use
  larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical
alternating current supply is available 
or
are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors 
in automobiles and other types of vehicles  including piston-powered airplanes  boats  trucks  etc    diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake air  so that more fuel can be burned per cycle  these engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power  this setup known as a    or  use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor  this setup known as a   
applications  
gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed 
in
of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer  a compressor is driven by a gas turbine fueled by gas bled from the pipeline  thus  no external power source is necessary 
petroleum refineries  natural gas processing plants  petrochemical and chemical plants  and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases 
and
equipment use compressors to move
in
cycles  see   
gas turbine systems compress the intake
air 
small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for     and other uses 
various industrial  manufacturing  and building processes require
to power  
in the manufacturing and blow moulding of pet plastic bottles and containers 
some aircraft require compressors to maintain
at altitude 
some types of such as
and  compress the air required for fuel combustion  the jet engine s
power the combustion air compressor 
in     and other life support devices  compressors put
into small volume containers  such as  
in   an air compressor frequently supplies low pressure air  10 to 20 bar  for breathing 
use compressors to store air for later use in displacing water from buoyancy chambers to adjust depth 
and
are compressors that increase
performance by increasing the mass flow of air inside the cylinder  so the engine can burn more fuel and hence produce more power 
and heavy
vehicles use
to operate
or
brakesand various other systems       
control  etc   
service stations and auto repair shops use compressed air to fill pneumatic
and power pneumatic tools 
and
exist to heat air or other gasses  and compressing the gas is only a means to that end
