history  
the early years  18851927  
although mark honeywells heating specialty company wouldnt be founded until 1906  todays honeywell traces its roots back to 1885 when the swiss-born
invented the damper-flapper  a
for coal furnaces  to automatically regulate heating systems  the following year he founded the butz thermo-electric regulator company  in 1888  after a falling out with his investors  butz left the company and transferred the patents to the legal firm paul  sanford  and merwin  who renamed the company the consolidated temperature controlling company  as the years passed  ctcc struggled with growing debts  and they underwent several name changes in an attempt to keep the business afloat  after the company was renamed to the electric heat regulator company in 1893    a stockholder in the company  was sold  an extensive list of patents  and named secretary-treasurer  22 on february 23  1898 he bought out the remaining shares of the company from the other stockholders 
in 1906  mark honeywell founded the honeywell heating specialty company in  
to manufacture and market his invention  the mercury seal generator  as honeywells company grew  thanks in part to the acquisition of jewell manufacturing company in 1922 to better automate his heating system  it began to clash with the renamed minneapolis heat regulator company  this led to the merging of the two companies into the publicly held minneapolis-honeywell regulator company in 1927  honeywell named its first president 
as its first chairman 
international expansion and acquisition  19271985  
w r  sweatt and his son harold provided 75 years of uninterrupted leadership for the company  w r  sweatt survived rough spots and turned an innovative idea  thermostatic heating control  into a thriving business  harold  who took over in 1934  led honeywell through a period of growth and global expansion that set the stage for honeywell to become a global technology leader  the merger into the minneapolis-honeywell regulator company proved to be a saving grace for the corporation  the combined assets were valued at over  3.5 million  with less than  1 million in liabilities just months before black monday  49 in 1931  minneapolis-honeywell began a period of expansion and acquisition when they purchased time-o-stat controls company  giving the company access to a greater number of patents to be used in their controls systems  1934 marked minneapolis-honeywells first foray into the international market  when they acquired the brown instrument company  and inherited their relationship with the yamatake company of tokyo  a japan-based distributor  51 later that same year  minneapolis-honeywell would also start distributorships across canada  as well as one in the netherlands  their first european office  this expansion into international markets continued in 1936  with their first distributorship in london  as well as their first foreign assembly facility being established in canada  by 1937  ten years after the merger  minneapolis-honeywell had over 3,000 employees  with  16 million in annual revenue 
having survived the depression  minneapolis-honeywell was approached by the us military for engineering and manufacturing projects  in 1941  minneapolis-honeywell developed a superior tank periscope and camera stabilizers  as well as the c-1 autopilot  the c-1 revolutionized precision bombing in the war effort  and was used on the two b-29 bombers that dropped atomic bombs on japan in 1945  the success of these projects led minneapolis-honeywell to open an aero division in chicago on october 5  1942  73 this division was responsible for the development of the formation stick to control autopilots  more accurate gas gauges for planes  and the turbo supercharger  79 in 1950  minneapolis-honeywells aero division was contracted for the controls on the first us nuclear submarine    88 the following year  the company acquired intervox company for their sonar  ultrasonics  and telemetry technologies  honeywell also helped develop and manufacture the
for the us navy  in 1953  in cooperation with the usaf wright-air development center  honeywell developed an automated control unit that could control an aircraft through various stages of a flight  from   to   to the point where the aircraft neared its destination and the pilot took over for   called the automatic master sequence selector  the onboard control operated similarly to a
to relay instructions to the aircraft s
at certain way points during the flight  significantly reducing the pilot s workload  technologically  this effort had parallels to contemporary efforts in
and   honeywell also developed the

and
on june 7  1999  honeywell was acquired by alliedsignal  who elected to retain the honeywell name for its brand recognition  the former honeywell moved their headquarters of 114 years to alliedsignal s in morristown  nj  while  technically  the deal looks more like an acquisition than a merger   from a strategic standpoint  it is a merger of equals   alliedsignal s 1998 revenue was reported at  15.1 billion to honeywell s  8.4 billion  but together the companies share huge business interests in aerospace  chemical products  automotive parts  and building controls 
in 2000  the new honeywell acquired pittway for  2.2 billion to gain a greater share of the fire-protection and security systems market  and merged it into their home and building control division  taking on pittway s  167 million in debt  analyst david jarrett commented that  while honeywell offered a hefty premium  it s still getting pittway for a bargain  at  45.50 per share  despite closing at  29 the week before  pittways ademco products complemented honeywells existing unified controls systems

in october 2000  honeywell  then valued at over  21 billion  accepted a takeover bid from then-ceo
of   the american department of justice cleared the merger  while  ge teams swooped down on honeywell  and  ge executives took over budget planning and employee reviews   however  on july 3  2001  the  s competition commissioner 
blocked the move  this decision was taken on the grounds that with ge s dominance of the large jet engine market  led by the
engine   its leasing services     and honeywell s portfolio of regional
and   the new company would be able to  bundle  products and stifle competition through the creation of a   us regulators disagreed  finding that the
would improve competition and reduce prices  united states assistant attorney general
called the eu s decision  antithetical to the goals of antitrust law enforcement   this led to a drop in morale and general tumult throughout honeywell  and in turn  the then-ceo michael bonsignore was fired as honeywell looked to turn their business around
