a wind turbine at       generating green electricity for approx 1000 homes 
there are a number of suppliers offering  green  electricity in the united kingdom  in theory these types of tariffs help to lower carbon emissions by increasing consumer demand for green electricity and encouraging more renewables to be built  since ofgem s 2014 regulations there are now set criteria defining what can be classified as a green source product  as well as holding sufficient
to cover the electricity sold to consumers  suppliers are also required to show
by contributing to wider environmental and low carbon funds 
care needs to be taken in selecting a
supplier  a
report in december 2006 concluded that many green tariffs are not delivering the environmental benefits they claim to  and that consumers may not be making the positive contribution they think they are

shades of green  
renewables obligation  
in the   suppliers are legally obliged to purchase a proportion of their electricity from renewable sources under the
and there is a danger that energy suppliers may sell such green electricity under a premium  green energy  tariff  rather than sourcing additional green electricity supplies  in addition to selling the green electricity to the consumer  it is also possible for the supplier to sell the associated
to another supplier who has failed to meet their quota  rather than  retiring  the certificate from the marketplace 
on several occasions in may 2016  britain burned no coal for electricity for the first time since 1882 
climate change levy  
non-domestic consumers can avoid paying the
by acquiring levy exemption certificates from renewable energy suppliers  since these are not required by domestic consumers  it is possible for the supplier to sell the certificates to the non-domestic sector  as well as selling the renewables obligation certificate and the electricity 
carbon offsetting  
see also 
prior to the ofgem green supply regulations  some green energy tariffs involved   rather than purchasing or investing in renewable energy  a practice that does not meet with universal approval    an english environmentalist and writer  has compared carbon offsets to the practice of purchasing
during the middle ages  whereby people believed they could purchase forgiveness for their sins  instead of actually repenting and not sinning anymore   monbiot also says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution 
reporting requirements  
in june 2008  defra announced that with effect from the current financial year  2008/9   green electricity is to be treated the same as average grid electricity for co2 reporting purposes  previously  it was treated as if there were no co2 emissions associated with it 
explaining the change  the minister responsible  hilary benn  said  i want to make sure that the green tariff market  which has grown rapidly over recent years  is clear for consumers and businesses about the precise benefit their tariff brings  many energy suppliers offer green tariffs to businesses and domestic customers who want to make a contribution to environmental projects or help tackle climate change  but these differ in what they deliver   he added  it is increasingly difficult to demonstrate that buying a renewable electricity tariff is offering additional carbon emissions reductions compared with what suppliers are required to source to meet the renewables obligation  i have therefore decided that we will change the voluntary corporate reporting guidelines to bring them into line with current best practice and provide coherent carbon accounting  this will mean that for the reporting year 2008-9  best practice is expected to be for businesses to use a grid average rate - average rate of carbon emissions associated with electricity transmitted on the national grid - unless their supplier can prove the carbon benefits are additional   this does not affect green electricity generated on site  e g  from photovoltaics or a micro-wind turbine   which can continue to be reported as producing zero emissions 
certification schemes  
in 1999 the
national certification scheme for green electricity was launched  however it was closed in 2002  apparently because too few suppliers were prepared to accept the proposed revised requirements 
in the absence of a replacement national scheme in the uk  the international   whose main purpose was to give accreditation to national green energy schemes  supported
and indicates that
would be ready for accreditation should a
compliant scheme be introduced in the uk  the eugene standard was discontinued in february 2009  leaving no internationally recognised means of comparing green electricity 
ofgem s 2007-8 proposals  
in an attempt to end some of the premium priced offerings by suppliers which were doing no more than repackaging electricity that they had to buy under the renewables obligation  the uk government s office of gas and electricity markets
proposed a voluntary scheme for independently verified energy ratings for electricity suppliers  initially this was intended to include a detailed analysis of the carbon content of the supply  but some critics felt that this lacked sufficient emphasis on additionality  and the actual energy used by consumers from the grid was always a mix of brown and green sources 
after running a series of workshops in early 2008  their proposals turned away from a focus on the source of electricity  and its associated
emissions   to look instead at whether an environmental benefit is demonstrated  essentially  ofgem suggest that this can only be done if the supplier invests part of payment received into one of the following activities 
installation of energy efficiency technologies  outside of the
- cert programme  
other consumer behaviour measures  such as active demand management or voluntary  
support for renewable heat installations 
additional investment in smaller-scale  e g  community based  renewable electricity projects - a limit of 1mw has been suggested for wind farms - or in other low carbon sources including
and  
retirement of eu allowances under the
 eu ets  
purchase of carbon offsets in line with defras quality assurance scheme for   typically offsets from developing countries under the  
research and development into emerging renewable technologies  or
contribution to an environmental charity 
the initial draft of the guidelines would have excluded most of the products currently available on the uk market  including offerings from renewable energy specialists
and  
the green energy supply certification scheme  
after consultation  ofgem introduced modified guidelines in february 2009  these placed a greater emphasis on the matching principle  requiring that all electricity sold under the scheme had to be matched by supplies from
 and excluding other low-carbon sources such as chp or nuclear   the additionality criteria were simplified slightly to comprise 
carbon offsets accredited either under the uk government s quality assurance scheme  qas  or under the
green energy schemes  mainly those that donate money to charities or to trust funds established to invest in new renewable projects  generally at a community level  and required to be independent of the suppliers
energy efficiency schemes  making savings above those from
including savings in customers  premises through lower energy use
unspecified other measures  producing equivalent carbon savings
certified tariffs are subject to an annual audit  to ensure that the matching and additionality criteria have been met  consumers must also be given information on the suppliers overall fuel mix at the point of sale  although aimed mainly at domestic consumers  the scheme can also certify tariffs aimed at small businesses with an annual energy consumption below 50,000kwh 
the scheme is controlled by an independent panel chaired by   and the
were appointed as the secretariat 
the scheme was launched in february 2010  with the six big uk energy suppliers as members as well as  
elected not to join the scheme citing concerns about the additionality rules  all suppliers offer domestic tariffs  but only some have offered small business tariffs under the scheme 
current ofgem regulation  
in response to concerns about the lack of regulation in the market for green electricity tariffs and in order to protect consumers  ofgem has consulted and enacted changes to the green tariff market in the uk  whereas previously the green tariff products were not subject to specific regulations  all retailers must now prove the green credentials of their products to ofgem  the regulations have three components 
electricity source - retailers need to hold sufficient renewable energy guarantee of origin certificates to match the quantity of electricity sold  retailers are required to submit proof of this to the regulator 
additionality - retailers also need to invest additional funds into other environmental projects 
transparency - retailers are required to inform consumers of how their tariffs benefit the environment 
areas of controversy  
there have been several areas of controversy regarding green electricity sales in the uk  these have been related to both the concept as a whole  which has been subject to criticism  but have usually manifested as disputes between the two leading green electricity companies 
retirement of renewable obligation certificates  rocs   
in 2009 the founder of ecotricity  dale vince  criticised good energy for their failure to retire a sufficient quantity of rocs  good energy had previously promised to retire 5  of its rocs  but vince claimed they had consistently retired fewer rocs than promised  he backed this up with evidence from ofgem  it appears that after this dispute good energy did increase the number of rocs it retired  but now seems to have ceased to do this entirely 
advertising standards authority case  
in 2016 ecotricity claimed in an advertisement that it was the greenest energy supplier  this claim was disputed by tesla motors and subsequently thrown out  the judgement faced criticism from good energy  with its managing director david brooks saying the asa appears to have based its decision purely on data provided by ecotricity without considering whether that data represents an objective view  obviously  the criteria ecotricity has chosen to measure itself against other companies has been selected to suit ecotricity  we dont think the asa has considered what it calls suitable comparative data before reaching its conclusions
