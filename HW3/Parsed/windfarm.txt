as a general rule  economic wind generators require windspeed of 16km h  10mph  or greater  an ideal location would have a near constant flow of non-turbulent wind throughout the year  with a minimum likelihood of sudden powerful bursts of wind  an important factor of turbine siting is also access to local demand or
capacity 
usually sites are screened on the basis of a   and validated with wind measurements 
wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project  collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential in order to finance the project  local winds are often monitored for a year or more  and detailed wind maps constructed before wind generators are installed 
the wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag  the increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography  surface roughness  and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings  typically  the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a   which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude  doubling the altitude of a turbine  then  increases the expected wind speeds by 10   and the expected power by 34  
in general  a distance of 7d  7  rotor diameter of the wind turbine  is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm  but micrositing optimizes placement  particularly in hilly areas  individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage  usually 34.5 kv  power collection system and communications network  at a   this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a
for connection to the high voltage transmission system  construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation  and possibly access roads to each turbine site

turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridgelines generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline  this is done to exploit the
as the wind accelerates over a ridge  the additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines  the exact position of each turbine matters  because a difference of 30m could potentially double output  this careful placement is referred to as  micro-siting

offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land  as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance  because water has less surface roughness than land  especially deeper water   the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water 
 utilisation rates  are considerably higher than for onshore locations 
the province of ontario in
is pursuing several proposed locations in the   including the suspended
approximately 20km from shore and over 400 mw in size  other canadian projects include one on the pacific west coast 
as of 2010  there are no offshore wind farms in the united states  however  projects are under development in wind-rich areas of the east coast  great lakes  and pacific coast  the
is scheduled for 2016 
installation and service   maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm  as of 2015  there are 20
for lifting components  but few can lift sizes above 5mw  service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7  availability higher than 80  of time  to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines    therefore  special fast service vehicles for installation  like wind turbine shuttle  as well as for maintenance  including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions  are required  so-called inertial and optical based ship stabilization and motion control systems  issmc  are used for that 
experimental and proposed wind farms  
there exist also some wind farms which were mainly built for testing wind turbines  in such wind farms  there is usually from each type to be tested only a single wind turbine  such farms have usually at least one meteorological tower  an example of an experimental wind farm is  
for some time  airborne wind farms have been discussed  an airborne wind farm is a group of airborne wind energy systems near to each other  connected to the grid in the same point

wind farm in   china
main article 
in just five years  china leapfrogged the rest of the world in wind energy production  going from 2,599 mw of capacity in 2006 to 62,733 mw at the end of 2011  however  the rapid growth outpaced china s infrastructure and new construction slowed significantly in 2012 
at the end of 2009  wind power in china accounted for 25.1  gw  of electricity generating capacity  and china has identified
as a key growth component of the country s economy  with its large land mass and long coastline  china has exceptional wind resources  researchers from harvard and
have found that china could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power by 2030 
by the end of 2008  at least 15 chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components  turbine sizes of 1.5mw to 3mw became common  leading wind power companies in china were     and
along with most major foreign wind turbine manufacturers  china also increased production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines  80mw  in 2008  through all these developments  the chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the   according to industry observers 
according to the   the development of wind energy in china  in terms of scale and rhythm  is absolutely unparalleled in the world  the
permanent committee passed a law that requires the chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector

europe s largest windfarm is the     an off-shore wind farm in the
in the   with a current capacity of 630 mw  and thus the world s largest off-shore wind farm   other large wind farms in europe include
near   romania with 600 mw capacity  and
near   scotland which has a total capacity of 539 mw 
an important limiting factor of wind power is
generated by wind farms  in most locations the wind blows only part of the time  which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing  to address this issue it has been proposed to create a    to connect national grids together across   ranging from denmark across the southern
to england and the
to ireland  and further south to france and spain especially in
which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world  the idea is that by the time a
has moved away from denmark to the
the next low appears off the coast of ireland  therefore  while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time  it will always be blowing somewhere

u s  wind power installed capacity in 2012 exceeded 51,630 mw and supplies 3  of the nation s electricity 
new installations place the u s  on a trajectory to generate 20  of the nations electricity by 2030 from wind energy  growth in 2008 channeled some  17billion into the economy  positioning wind power as one of the leading sources of new power generation in the country  along with   wind projects completed in 2008 accounted for about 42  of the entire new power-producing capacity added in the u s  during the year 
at the end of 2008  about 85,000 people were employed in the u s  wind industry  and
was the largest domestic
manufacturer  wind projects boosted local tax bases and revitalized the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land  wind power in the u s  provides enough electricity to power the equivalent of nearly 9 million homes  avoiding the emissions of 57 million tons of carbon each year and reducing expected

with 4,536mw  the
 1,020mw  in
is the nation s largest wind farm in terms of capacity 
is the largest wind farm in the u s  in terms of the number of individual turbines 
criticism  
public perception is that renewable energies such as wind  solar  biomass and geothermal are having a significant positive impact on global warming  all of these sources combined only supplied 1.3  of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually 
one of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition  a study has shown  turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development  
wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites  the viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon  instead falling to the developer  for example  sturge et al  of the university of sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular  engineering aspects  specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration  either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development  as energy is the main purpose of wind farms  a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms 
environmental impact  
main article 
livestock ignore wind turbines  and continue to graze as they did before wind turbines were installed 
compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources  the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor 
consumes no fuel  and emits no   unlike fossil fuel power sources  the energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months  while a wind farm may cover a large area of land  many land uses such as agriculture are compatible  with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use 
there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures  the scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant  depending on specific circumstances  the estimated number of bird deaths caused by wind turbines is between 140,000 and 328,000  whereas deaths caused by domestic cats are estimated to be between 1.3 and 4.0 billion birds each year and over 100 million birds are killed each year by impact with windows  prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities  and protection of   affect the siting and operation of wind turbines 
human health  
see also 
there have been multiple scientific  peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise  which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for  wind turbine syndrome   although some suggest further research might still be useful 
a 2007 report by the u s  national research council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so  low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans    there are opposing views on this subject  and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans 
in a 2009 report about  rural wind farms   a standing committee of the parliament of new south wales  australia  recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses  which can be waived by the affected neighbour  as a precautionary approach 
a 2014 paper suggests that the  wind turbine syndrome  is mainly caused by the
effect and other psychological mechanisms 
effect on power grid

utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy  the wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line  the company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like ge  for example   
ground radar interference  
wind farm interference  in yellow circle  on radar map
wind farms can interfere with ground
systems used for  
and   the large  rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern  actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected  as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that  but aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task  the us military is using wind turbines on some bases  including
near the  
effects  
the level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar  the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines aircraft with respect to the radar  an aircraft flying above the wind farm s turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity  studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning  issues include masking  shadowing   clutter  noise   and signal alteration  radar issues have stalled as much as 10,000 mw of projects in usa 
some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms 
mitigation  
permanent problem solving include a non-initiation window to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm  and a similar method mitigates the false returns  england s
is using a short-term mitigation  to  blank  the turbines on the radar map with a software patch  wind turbine blades using
are being developed to mitigate radar reflection problems for   as well as stealth windfarms  the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference 
in early 2011  the u s  government awarded a program to build a radar wind turbine analysis tool  this tool will allow developers to predict the impact of a wind farm on a radar system before construction  thus allowing rearrangement of the turbines or even the entire wind farm to avoid negative impacts on the radar system 
a mobile radar system  the lockheed martin tps-77  has shown in recent tests that it can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines  and more than 170 tps-77 radars are in use around the world  in britain  the lockheed martin tps-77 system was to be installed at trimingham in norfolk to remove military objections to a series of offshore wind farms in the north sea  a second tps-77 was to be installed in the scottish borders  overcoming objections to a 48-turbine wind farm at fallago 
radio reception interference  
there are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities  potential solutions include predictive interference modeling as a component of site selection 
agriculture  
a 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms  the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades 
in another study an analysis carried out on
and
crops in the central areas of the united states noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts  and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves  even at the height of summer heat  the lowering of 2.53 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades  can make a difference for the cultivation of corn
