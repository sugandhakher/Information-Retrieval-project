transient fault  
a transient fault is a fault that is no longer present if power is disconnected for a short time and then restored  or an insulation fault which only temporarily affects a device s dielectric properties which are restored after a short time  many faults in
are transient in nature  when a fault occurs  equipment used for
operate to isolate the area of the fault  a transient fault will then clear and the power-line can be returned to service  typical examples of transient faults include 
momentary tree contact
bird or other animal contact
and
systems use an automatic re-close function which is commonly used on overhead lines to attempt to restore power in the event of a transient fault  this functionality is not as common on underground systems as faults there are typically of a
nature  transient faults may still cause damage both at the site of the original fault or elsewhere in the network as fault current is generated 
persistent fault  
a persistent fault does not disappear when power is disconnected  faults in underground
are most often persistent due to mechanical damage to the cable  but are sometimes transient in nature due to lightning 
symmetric fault  
a symmetric or balanced fault affects each of the three phases equally  in transmission line faults  roughly 5  are symmetric  this is in contrast to an asymmetrical fault  where the three phases are not affected equally 
asymmetric fault  
an asymmetric or unbalanced fault does not affect each of the three phases equally  common types of asymmetric faults  and their causes 
line-to-line - a
between lines  caused by
of air  or when lines come into physical contact  for example due to a broken   in transmission line faults  roughly 5  - 10  are asymmetric line-to-line faults 
line-to-ground - a short circuit between one line and ground  very often caused by physical contact  for example due to
or other
damage  in transmission line faults  roughly 65  - 70  are asymmetric line-to-ground faults 
double line-to-ground - two lines come into contact with the ground  and each other   also commonly due to storm damage  in transmission line faults  roughly 15  - 20  are asymmetric double line-to-ground 
bolted fault  
one extreme is where the fault has zero impedance  giving the maximum   notionally  all the conductors are considered connected to ground as if by a metallic conductor  this is called a  bolted fault   it would be unusual in a well-designed power system to have a metallic short circuit to ground but such faults can occur by mischance  in one type of transmission line protection  a  bolted fault  is deliberately introduced to speed up operation of protective devices 
realistic faults  
realistically  the resistance in a fault can be from close to zero to fairly high  a large amount of power may be consumed in the fault  compared with the zero-impedance case where the power is zero  also  arcs are highly non-linear  so a simple resistance is not a good model  all possible cases need to be considered for a good analysis 
arcing fault  
where the system voltage is high enough  an
may form between power system conductors and ground  such an arc can have a relatively high impedance  compared to the normal operating levels of the system  and can be difficult to detect by simple overcurrent protection  for example  an arc of several hundred amperes on a circuit normally carrying a thousand amperes may not trip overcurrent circuit breakers but can do enormous damage to bus bars or cables before it becomes a complete short circuit  utility  industrial  and commercial power systems have additional protection devices to detect relatively small but undesired currents escaping to ground  in residential wiring  electrical regulations may now require
on building wiring circuits  to detect small arcs before they cause damage or a fire 
analysis  
symmetric faults can be analyzed via the same methods as any other phenomena in power systems  and in fact many
tools exist to accomplish this type of analysis automatically  see    however  there is another method which is as accurate and is usually more instructive 
first  some simplifying assumptions are made  it is assumed that all
in the system are in phase  and operating at the nominal
of the system 
can also be considered to be generators  because when a fault occurs  they usually supply rather than draw power  the voltages and
are then calculated for this base case 
next  the location of the fault is considered to be supplied with a negative voltage source  equal to the voltage at that location in the base case  while all other sources are set to zero  this method makes use of the principle of  
to obtain a more accurate result  these calculations should be performed separately for three separate time ranges 
subtransient is first  and is associated with the largest currents
comes between subtransient and steady-state
steady-state occurs after all the transients have had time to settle
an asymmetric fault breaks the underlying assumptions used in three-phase power  namely that the
is balanced on all three phases  consequently  it is impossible to directly use tools such as the   where only one phase is considered  however  due to the
of power systems  it is usual to consider the resulting
and
as a superposition of   to which three-phase analysis can be applied 
in the method of symmetric components  the power system is seen as a
of three components 
a positive-sequence component  in which the phases are in the same order as the original system  i e   a-b-c
a negative-sequence component  in which the phases are in the opposite order as the original system  i e   a-c-b
a zero-sequence component  which is not truly a three-phase system  but instead all three phases are in phase with each other 
to determine the currents resulting from an asymmetrical fault  one must first know the
zero-  positive-  and negative-sequence impedances of the transmission lines  generators  and transformers involved  three separate circuits are then constructed using these impedances  the individual circuits are then connected together in a particular arrangement that depends upon the type of fault being studied  this can be found in most power systems textbooks   once the sequence circuits are properly connected  the network can then be analyzed using classical circuit analysis techniques  the solution results in voltages and currents that exist as symmetrical components  these must be transformed back into phase values by using the  
analysis of the
is required for selection of protective devices such as
and   if a circuit is to be properly protected  the fault current must be high enough to operate the protective device within as short a time as possible  also the protective device must be able to withstand the fault current and extinguish any resulting arcs without itself being destroyed or sustaining the arc for any significant length of time 
the magnitude of fault currents differ widely depending on the type of earthing system used  the installation s supply type and earthing system  and its proximity to the supply  for example  for a domestic uk 230 v  60 a tn-s or usa 120 v 240 v supply  fault currents may be a few thousand amperes  large low-voltage networks with multiple sources may have fault levels of 300,000 amperes  a high-resistance-grounded system may restrict line to ground fault current to only 5 amperes  prior to selecting protective devices  prospective fault current must be measured reliably at the origin of the installation and at the furthest point of each circuit  and this information applied properly to the application of the circuits 
detecting and locating faults  
overhead power lines are easiest to diagnose since the problem is usually obvious  e g   a tree has fallen across the line  or a utility pole is broken and the conductors are lying on the ground 
locating faults in a cable system can be done either with the circuit de-energized  or in some cases  with the circuit under power  fault location techniques can be broadly divided into terminal methods  which use voltages and currents measured at the ends of the cable  and tracer methods  which require inspection along the length of the cable  terminal methods can be used to locate the general area of the fault  to expedite tracing on a long or buried cable 
in very simple wiring systems  the fault location is often found through inspection of the wires  in complex wiring systems  for example  aircraft wiring  where the wires may be hidden  wiring faults are located with a   the time domain reflectometer sends a pulse down the wire and then analyzes the returning reflected pulse to identify faults within the electrical wire 
in historic   sensitive
were used to measure fault currents  by testing at both ends of a faulted cable  the fault location could be isolated to within a few miles  which allowed the cable to be grappled up and repaired  the
and the varley loop were two types of connections for locating faults in cables
sometimes an insulation fault in a power cable will not show up at lower voltages  a  thumper  test set applies a high-energy  high-voltage pulse to the cable  fault location is done by listening for the sound of the discharge at the fault  while this test contributes to damage at the cable site  it is practical because the faulted location would have to be re-insulated when found in any case 
in a high resistance grounded distribution system  a feeder may develop a fault to ground but the system continues in operation  the faulted  but energized  feeder can be found with a ring-type current transformer collecting all the phase wires of the circuit  only the circuit containing a fault to ground will show a net unbalanced current  to make the ground fault current easier to detect  the grounding resistor of the system may be switched between two values so that the fault current pulses 
batteries  
the prospective fault current of larger batteries  such as
used in   is often given by the manufacturer 
in australia  when this information is not given  the prospective fault current in amperes  should be considered to be 6 times the nominal battery capacity at the c120 ah rate   according to as 4086 part 2  appendix h
