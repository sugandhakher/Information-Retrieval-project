a group of small-scale wind turbines providing electricity to a community in     china
part of a series about
microgeneration
microgeneration is the small-scale generation of heat and
by individuals  small businesses and communities to meet their own needs  as alternatives or supplements to traditional centralized grid-connected power  although this may be motivated by practical considerations  such as unreliable grid power or long distance from the   the term is mainly used currently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or
footprints or cost reduction  it differs from
in that it is principally concerned with fixed
rather than for use with mobile devices

technologies and set-up  
microgeneration technologies include small-scale           and
installations  these technologies are often combined to form a
solution that can offer superior performance and lower cost than a system based on one generator 
power plant  
in addition to the electricity production plant  e g  wind turbine and solar panel   infrastructure for
and a
is usually needed and or foreseen  although a hookup to the regular electricity grid is not essential  it helps to decrease costs by allowing   in the developing world however  the start-up cost for this equipment is generally too high  thus leaving no choice but to opt for alternative set-ups 
extra equipment needed besides the power plant  
a complete pv-solar system
the whole of the equipment required to set up a working system and for an off-the-grid generation and or a hook up to the electricity grid herefore is termed a
and is composed of the following parts with pv-systems 
energy storage apparatus  
a major issue with off-grid solar and wind systems is that the power is often needed when the sun is not shining or when the wind is calm  this is generally not required for purely grid-connected systems 
a series of   stationary or
 the most common solution 
or other means of energy storage  e g  hydrogen      
tanks      
a
for charging the batteries or other energy storage
for converting dc battery power into ac as required for many appliances  or for feeding excess power into a commercial power grid 
an
or   the whole is also sometimes referred to as  power conditioning equipment 
safety equipment  
 
or
and   the whole is also sometimes referred to as  safety equipment 
usually  in microgeneration for homes in the developing world  prefabricated house-wiring systems  as
or prefabricated   are used instead   simplified house-wiring boxes and cables  known as wiring harnesses  can simply be bought and mounted into the building without requiring much knowledge about the wiring itself  as such  even people without technical expertise are able to install them  in addition  they are also comparatively cheap and offer safety advantages 
battery meters  for
rate and    and meters for
and electricity provision to the regular power grid
small-scale  diy  generation system
wind turbine specific  
with wind turbines  hydroelectric plants      the extra equipment needed
is more or less the same as with pv-systems  depending on the type of wind turbine used  yet also include 
a manual disconnect switch
foundation for the tower
grounding system
shutoff and or dummy-load devices for use in high wind when power generated exceeds current needs and storage system capacity 
vibro-wind power  
a new wind energy technology is being developed that converts energy from wind energy vibrations to electricity  this energy  called vibro-wind technology  can use winds of less strength than normal wind turbines  and can be placed in almost any location 
a prototype consisted of a panel mounted with oscillators made out of pieces of foam  the conversion from mechanical to electrical energy is done using a piezoelectric transducer  a device made of a ceramic or polymer that emits electrons when stressed  the building of this prototype was led by francis moon  professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at   moon s work in vibro-wind technology was funded by the
at cornell 
possible set-ups  
several microgeneration set-ups are possible  these are 
set-ups which include 
off-the grid set-ups without energy storage  e g   battery      
off-the grid set-ups with energy storage  e g   battery      
battery charging stations
grid-connected set-ups which include 
grid connected with backup to power critical loads
grid-connected set-ups without financial recompensation scheme
grid-connected set-ups with
grid connected set-ups with
all set-ups mentioned can work either on a single power plant or a
of power plants  in which case it is called a
system   for safety  grid-connected set-ups must automatically switch off or enter an  anti-islanding mode  when there is a failure of the mains power supply  for more about this  see the article on the condition of  
costs  
depending on the set-up chosen  financial recompensation scheme  power plant  extra equipment   prices may vary  according to   microgeneration at home which uses the latest in cost saving-technology  wiring harnesses  ready boards  cheap diy-power plants  e g  diy wind turbines  the household expenditure can be extremely low-cost  in fact  practical action mentions that many households in farming communities in the developing world spend less than  1 for electricity per month    however  if matters are handled less economically  using more commercial systems approaches   costs will be dramatically higher  in most cases however  financial advantage will still be done using microgeneration on renewable power plants  often in the range of 50-90 
as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance
or energy losses from the
in transformers where in general 8-15  of the energy is lost 
in the uk  the government offers both grants and feedback payments to help businesses  communities and private homes to install these technologies  businesses can write the full cost of installation off against taxable profits whilst homeowners receive a flat rate grant or payments per kw h of electricity generated and paid back into the national grid  community organisations can also receive up to 200,000 in grant funding 
in the uk  the microgeneration certification scheme provides approval for microgeneration installers and products which is a mandatory requirement of funding schemes such as the feed in tariffs and renewable heat incentive 
grid parity  
 or socket parity  occurs when an
source can generate electricity at a
 lcoe  that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from   reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without
or government support  it is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity 
grid parity has been reached in some locations with on-shore wind power around 2000  and with solar power it was achieved for the first time in spain in 2013 
comparison with large-scale generation

other names
distributed generation
centralized generation
waste heat by-product
can be used for heating purposes  thus greatly increasing efficiency and offsetting energy total costs  this method is known as
 microchp  
it is used in some privately owned industrial
 chp  installations  it s also use in large-scale applications where it s called
and uses the heat that is normally exhausted by inefficient powerplants 
transmission losses
proximity to end user typically closer resulting in potentially fewer losses 
a significant proportion of electrical power is lost during transmission  approximately 8  in the
according to
radio 4 today programme in march 2006  
changes to grid
reduces the transmission load  and thus reduces the need for grid upgrades
increases the power transmitted  and thus increases the need for grid upgrades
grid failure event
electricity may still be available to local area in many circumstances
electricity may be not available due to grid
consumer choices
may choose to purchase any legal system
may choose to purchase offerings of the power company
reliability and maintenance requirements
    and certain other systems  are usually extremely reliable  and can generate
continuously for many thousands of hours with little or no maintenance  however  unreliable systems will incur additional maintenance labor and costs 
managed by power company  grid reliability varies with location 
ability to meet needs
for wind and solar energy  the actual production is only a
of  
fuel based systems are fully
solar panels are simple and reliable  they can provide a little electricity at a reasonable cost 
commentators claim that householders who buy their electricity with green energy tariffs can reduce their carbon usage further than with microgeneration and at a lower cost 
necessitates mass production of generators which will create an associated environmental impact  systems are less expensive when produced in quantity 
more economical given the larger scale of the generators 
microgeneration can dynamically balance the
for electric power  by producing more power during periods of high demand and high grid prices  and less power during periods of low demand and low grid prices  this  hybridized grid  allows both microgeneration systems and large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than either could alone

microgeneration can be integrated as part of a
house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems   and     
or even complete
systems  domestic microgeneration technologies include    small-scale  
installations

private generation decentralizes the generation of electricity and may also centralize the pooling of surplus energy  while they have to be purchased  solar shingles and panels are both available 
is high  but saves in the long run  with appropriate power conversion  solar pv panels can run the same electric appliances as electricity from other sources 
passive
is another effective method of utilizing solar power  the simplest method is the solar  or a black plastic  bag  set between 1 and 5 gallons out in the sun and allow to heat  perfect for a quick warm shower 
the breadbox heater can be constructed easily with recycled materials and basic building experience  consisting of a single or array of black tanks mounted inside a sturdy box insulated on the bottom and sides  the lid  either horizontal or angled to catch the most sun  should be well sealed and of a transparent glazing material  glass  fiberglass  or high temp resistant molded plastic   cold water enters the tank near the bottom  heats and rises to the top where it is piped back into the home 
exploit stable ground temperatures by benefiting from the thermal energy storage capacity of the ground  typically ground source heat pumps have a high initial cost and are difficult to install by the average homeowner  they use electric motors to transfer heat from the ground with a high level of efficiency  the electricity may come from renewable sources or from external non-renewable sources 
fuel  
is an
that can power diesel engines and can be used for domestic heating  numerous forms of biomass  including soybeans  peanuts  and algae  which has the highest yield   can be used to make biodiesel  recycled vegetable oil  from restaurants  can also be converted into biodiesel 
is another alternative fuel  created from the waste product of animals  though less practical for most homes  a farm environment provides a perfect place to implement the process  by mixing the waste and water in a tank with space left for air  methane produces naturally in the airspace  this methane can be piped out and burned  and used for a cookfire 
the biogaspro digester provides an easily installed digester suitable for small farms or even large homes  groups of homes can possible group together to use a digester
government policy  
policymakers were accustomed to an energy system based on big  centralised projects like nuclear or gas-fired power stations  a change of mindsets and incentives are bringing microgeneration into the mainstream  planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the retrofitting of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings 
most of developed countries  including canada  alberta   the united kingdom  germany  poland  israel and usa have laws allowing microgenerated electricity to be sold into the national grid 
alberta  canada  
in january 2009  the government of albertas micro-generation regulation came into effect  setting rules that allow albertans to generate their own environmentally friendly electricity and receive credit for any power they send into the electricity grid 
poland  
in december 2014  the polish government will vote on a bill which calls for microgeneration  as well as large scale wind farms in the
as a solution to cut back on co2 emissions from the country s coal plants as well as to reduce polish dependence on russian gas  under the terms of the new bill  individuals and small businesses which generate up to 40kw of  green  energy will receive 100  of market price for any electricity they feed back into the grid  and businesses who set up large-scale offshore wind farms in the baltic will be eligible for subsidization by the state  costs of implementing these new policies will be offset by the creation of a new tax on non-sustainable energy use 
united states  
the united states has inconsistent energy generation policies across its 50 states  state energy policies and laws may vary significantly with location  some states have imposed requirements on utilities that a certain percentage of total power generation be from renewable sources  for this purpose  renewable sources include wind  hydroelectric  and solar power whether from large or microgeneration projects  further  in some areas transferrable  renewable source energy  credits are needed by power companies to meet these mandates  as a result  in some portions of the united states  power companies will pay a portion of the cost of renewable source microgeneration projects in their service areas  these rebates are in addition to any federal or state renewable-energy income-tax credits that may be applicable  in other areas  such rebates may differ or may not be available 
united kingdom  
the uk government published its microgeneration strategy in march 2006  although it was seen as a disappointment by many commentators  in contrast  the
has been viewed as a positive step  to replace earlier schemes  the
 dti  launched the
in april 2006  which provided grants to individuals  communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies  these schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the
 decc  for clean energy cashback via feed-in tariffs
for generating electricity from april 2010 and the renewable heat incentive
for generating renewable heat from 28 november 2011 
feed-in tariffs are intended to incentivise small-scale  less than 5mw   low-carbon electricity generation  these feed-in tariffs work alongside the renewables obligation  ro   which will remain the primary mechanism to incentivise deployment of large-scale renewable electricity generation  the renewable heat incentive  rhi  in intended to incentivise the generation of heat from renewable sources  they also currently offer up to 21p per kwh from december 2011 in the tariff for photovoltaics plus another 3p for the export tariff - an overall figure which could see a household earning back double what they currently pay for their electricity 
on 31 october 2011  the government announced a sudden cut in the feed-in tariff from 43.3p kwh to 21p kwh with the new tariff to apply to all new solar pv installations with an eligibility date on or after 12 december 2011 
prominent british politicians who have announced they are fitting microgenerating facilities to their homes include the conservative party leader    and the labour science     these plans included small domestic sized wind turbines  cameron  before becoming prime minister in the   had been asked during an interview on bbc ones
on october 29  2006  if he would do the same should he get to   if theyd let me  yes  he replied 
in the december 2006
the government announced that the sale of surplus electricity from installations designed for personal use  would not be subject to   legislation to this effect has been included in the finance bill 2007 
in popular culture  
several movies and tv shows such as    
and
have done a great deal in raising interest in microgeneration among the general public  websites such as
and
propose
solutions that can lower the cost of microgeneration  thus increasing its popularity  specialised magazines such as otherpower and
also provide practical advice and guidance
