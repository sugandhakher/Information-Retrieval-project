and   airtricity was subsequently bought by
who have bought out fluor s 50  stake for 40m which is expected to cost 1.3b  fluor are now contracted to design  supply  installation and commissioning of the balance of the plant  scottish and southern sold a 50  stake to   the owners of   in november 2008 for 308m 
the project was given the go-ahead in may 2008 and work started in june  in july 2011 erection of the turbines was two thirds complete  with all the pile foundations installed
