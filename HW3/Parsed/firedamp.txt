firedamp is
found in   it is the name given to a number of flammable gases  especially   it is particularly found in areas where the coal is   the gas accumulates in pockets in the coal and adjacent strata  and when they are penetrated  the release can trigger explosions  historically  if such a pocket was highly pressurized  it was termed a  bag of foulness

name  
is the collective name given to all gases  other than air  found in coal mines in great britain  the word corresponds to german dampf  the name for  vapour  
alongside firedamp  other damps include
  and other gases   poisonous  explosive
    with its characteristic  rotten egg  odour  and the insidiously lethal
  and other gases  produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust 
contribution to mine deaths  
firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4  and 16   with most explosions occurring at around 10   it caused much loss of life in coal mines before the invention of the
and   the invention was prompted by the

experimented with
  determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum
thickness to prevent a
passing through the gauze  if a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze  then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame  he did not patent his invention 
even after the safety lamps were brought into common use  firedamp explosions could still occur from sparks produced when coal contaminated with
was struck with metal tools  the presence of
in the air increased the risk of explosion with firedamp  and indeed could cause explosions itself 
davy lamp  drawing 
the
coal mines in england had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites  and a great number of lives were lost in accidents due to firedamp explosions  including 102 dead at
in 1835  a continuous flame was produced at
some time before 1733  described as being  a yard wide and two yards long   the miners dealt with it by piping it to the outside 
rather than the davy lamp  tyneside miners used the geordie lamp  a similar safety lamp designed by   after the widespread introduction of the safety lamp  explosions continued because the early davy lamps were fragile and easily damaged  the iron gauze for example only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe  the light was also very poor  and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design  the height of the cone of burning methane in a flame safety lamp can be used to estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere  it was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries
