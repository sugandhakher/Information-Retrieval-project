employs   each comprising a number of   which generate electrical power  the first step is the photoelectric effect followed by an
process where crystallized atoms 
in a series  generate an electric current  pv installations may be ground-mounted 
mounted or wall mounted 
solar pv generates no pollution  the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts  photovoltaic systems have been used for fifty years in specialized applications  standalone and
have been in use for more than twenty years  they were first mass-produced in 2000  when german environmentalists and the
organization got government funding for a ten thousand roof program 
on the other hand  grid-connected pv systems have the major disadvantage that the power output is dependent on direct sunlight  so about 10-25  is lost if a tracking system is not used  since the cell wil not be directly facing the sun at all times power output is also adversely affected by weather conditions such as the amount of dust and water vapour in the air or the amount of cloud cover  this means that  in the national grid for example  this power has to be made up by other power sources  hydrocarbon  nuclear  hydroelectric or wind energy 
advances in technology and increased manufacturing scale have reduced the cost  increased the reliability  and increased the efficiency of photovoltaic instalations and the

etymology  
the term  photovoltaic  comes from the
  phs  meaning  light   and from  volt   the unit of electro-motive force  the   which in turn comes from the last name of the
physicist   inventor of the battery     the term  photo-voltaic  has been in use in english since 1849 
solar cells

directly from  
average insolation  note that this is for a horizontal surface  solar panels are normally propped up at an angle and receive more energy per unit area 
photovoltaics are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons  the
refers to photons of light exciting electrons into a higher state of energy  allowing them to act as charge carriers for an electric current  the photovoltaic effect was first observed by
in 1839  the term photovoltaic denotes the unbiased operating mode of a
in which current through the device is entirely due to the transduced light energy  virtually all photovoltaic devices are some type of photodiode 
solar cells produce direct current electricity from sun light which can be used to power equipment or to   the first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other   but today the majority of
are used for grid connected power generation  in this case an
is required to convert the dc to ac  there is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings      electric cars  roadside emergency telephones    and
of  
photovoltaic power generation employs
composed of a number of
containing a photovoltaic material  materials presently used for photovoltaics include         and  sulfide 
connect modules  module cable   arrays  array cable   and sub-fields  because of the growing demand for
sources  the manufacturing of solar cells and
has advanced considerably in recent years 
solar photovoltaics power generation has long been seen as a
technology which draws upon the planets most plentiful and widely distributed renewable energy source  the sun  the technology is  inherently elegant  in that the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts or environmental emissions during operation  it is well proven  as photovoltaic systems have now been used for fifty years in specialised applications  and grid-connected systems have been in use for over twenty years 
cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly behind a glass sheet  when more power is required than a single cell can deliver  cells are electrically connected together to form photovoltaic modules  or solar panels  a single module is enough to power an emergency telephone  but for a house or a power plant the modules must be arranged in multiples as  
photovoltaic power capacity is measured as maximum power output under standardized test conditions  stc  in  wp      the actual power output at a particular point in time may be less than or greater than this standardized  or  rated   value  depending on geographical location  time of day  weather conditions  and other factors  solar photovoltaic array
are typically under 25   which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity 
current developments  
for best performance  terrestrial pv systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun 
achieve this by moving pv panels to follow the sun  the increase can be by as much as 20  in winter and by as much as 50  in summer  static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the   panels are often set to latitude tilt  an angle equal to the latitude  but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter  generally  as with other semiconductor devices  temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics 
a number of solar panels may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower  if the
of the
is greater than zero  and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis  in such a tower the panels can follow the sun exactly  such a device may be described as a
mounted on a turnable disk  each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular   in case the zenith distance of the sun reaches zero  the  ladder  may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel  instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the   meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the   in this case the angle between the axis and the sun is always larger than 66 degrees  during a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the sun  installations may be ground-mounted  and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing  or built into the roof or walls of a building    
another recent development involves the makeup of solar cells 
is a very inexpensive material which is being used to replace the expensive
which is still part of a standard pv cell build to this day  michael graetzel  director of the laboratory of photonics and interfaces at epfl says   today  efficiency has peaked at 18 percent  but it s expected to get even higher in the future   this is a significant claim  as 20  efficiency is typical among solar panels which use more expensive materials

best research-cell efficiencies
electrical efficiency  also called conversion efficiency  is a contributing factor in the selection of a photovoltaic system  however  the most efficient solar panels are typically the most expensive  and may not be commercially available  therefore  selection is also driven by cost efficiency and other factors 
the electrical efficiency of a pv cell is a
which represents how much electrical power a cell can produce for a given   the basic expression for maximum efficiency of a photovoltaic cell is given by the ratio of output power to the incident solar power  radiation flux times area

the efficiency is measured under ideal laboratory conditions and represents the maximum achievable efficiency of the pv material  actual efficiency is influenced by the output voltage  current  junction temperature  light intensity and spectrum   
the most efficient type of solar cell to date is a multi-junction concentrator solar cell with an efficiency of 46.0  produced by
in december 2014  the highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by
at 35.8  using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009  and boeing spectrolab  40.7  also using a triple-layer design   the us company
produces cells that have an efficiency of 21.5   well above the market average of 1218  
there is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of pv cells and modules  primarily for competitive advantage  in order to increase the efficiency of solar cells  it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate
that matches the solar spectrum  this will enhance the electrical and optical properties  improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency  there are several groups of materials that are being developed  ultrahigh-efficiency devices   30   are made by using gaas and gainp2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells  high-quality  single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency  low cost cells   20   
recent developments in organic photovoltaic cells  opvs  have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3  to over 15  since their introduction in the 1980s  to date  the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges from 6.7  to 8.94  for small molecule  8.4 10.6  for polymer opvs  and 7  to 21  for perovskite opvs  opvs are expected to play a major role in the pv market  recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost  while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable 
several companies have begun embedding
into pv modules called   these modules perform
 mppt  for each module individually  measure performance data for monitoring  and provide additional safety features  such modules can also compensate for shading effects  wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease 
one of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating  the efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5  for every 1 degree celsius increase in temperature  this means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half  self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem  rather than using energy to cool the surface  pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from   and attached to the surface of a solar panel  doing so allows visible light to reach the   but reflects

environmental impacts of photovoltaic technologies  
types of impacts
while solar photovoltaic  pv  cells are promising for clean energy production  their deployment is hindered by production costs  material availability  and toxicity 
 lca  is one method of determining environmental impacts from pv  many studies have been done on the various types of pv including   second generation  and   usually these pv lca studies select a cradle to gate system boundary because often at the time the studies are conducted  it is a new technology not commercially available yet and their required balance of system components and disposal methods are unknown 
a traditional lca can look at many different impact categories ranging from   eco-toxicity  human toxicity  water depletion  and many others  most lcas of pv have focused on two categories  carbon dioxide equivalents per kwh and energy pay-back time  epbt   the epbt is defined as   the time needed to compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a pv system   a 2015 review of epbt from first and second generation pv suggested that there was greater variation in embedded energy than in efficiency of the cells implying that it was mainly the embedded energy that needs to reduce to have a greater reduction in epbt  one difficulty in determining impacts due to pv is to determine if the wastes are released to the air  water  or soil during the manufacturing phase  research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of pv systems 
impacts from first-generation pv
modules are the most extensively studied pv type in terms of lca since they are the most commonly used 
photovoltaic systems  mono-si  have an average efficiency of 14.0   the cells tend to follow a structure of front electrode  anti-reflection film  n-layer  p-layer  and back electrode  with the sun hitting the front electrode  epbt ranges from 1.7 to 2.7 years  the cradle to gate of co2-eq kwh ranges from 37.3 to 72.2 grams 
techniques to produce
 multi-si  photovoltaic cells are simpler and cheaper than mono-si  however tend to make less efficient cells  an average of 13.2   epbt ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 years  the cradle to gate of co2-eq kwh ranges from 28.5 to 69 grams  some studies have looked beyond epbt and gwp to other environmental impacts  in one such study  conventional energy mix in greece was compared to multi-si pv and found a 95  overall reduction in impacts including carcinogens  eco-toxicity  acidification  eutrophication  and eleven others 
impacts from second generation
 cdte  is one of the fastest-growing
which are collectively known as second generation devices  this new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions    as conventional si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing  today the global market share of cdte is 5.4   up from 4.7  in 2008  this technologys highest power conversion efficiency is 21   the cell structure includes glass substrate  around 2mm   transparent conductor layer  cds buffer layer  50150nm   cdte absorber and a metal contact layer 
cdte pv systems require less energy input in their production than other commercial pv systems per unit electricity production  the average co2-eq kwh is around 18 grams  cradle to gate   cdte has the fastest epbt of all commercial pv technologies  which varies between 0.3 and 1.2 years 
 cigs  is a thin film solar cell based on the copper indium diselenide  cis  family of chalcopyrite   cis and cigs are often used interchangeably within the cis cigs community  the cell structure includes soda lime glass as the substrate  mo layer as the back contact  cis cigs as the absorber layer  cadmium sulfide  cds  or zn  s oh x as the buffer layer  and zno al as the front contact  cigs is approximately 1/100th the thickness of conventional silicon solar cell technologies  materials necessary for assembly are readily available  and are less costly per watt of solar cell  cigs based solar devices resist performance degradation over time and are highly stable in the field 
reported global warming potential impacts of cigs range from 20.5  58.8 grams co2-eq kwh of electricity generated for different
 1,700 to 2,200 kwh m2 y  and power conversion efficiency  7.8  9.12    epbt ranges from 0.2 to 1.4 years  while harmonized value of epbt was found 1.393 years  toxicity is an issue within the buffer layer of cigs modules because it contains cadmium and gallium  cis modules do not contain any heavy metals 
impacts from third generation
third-generation pvs are designed to combine the advantages of both the first and second generation devices and they do not have shockley-queisser efficiency limit  a theoretical limit for first and second generation pv cells  the thickness of a third generation device is less than 1m 
one emerging alternative and promising technology is based on an organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell made of methylammonium lead halide perovskites 
have progressed rapidly over the past few years and have become one of the most attractive areas for pv research  the cell structure includes a metal back contact  which can be made of al  au or ag   a hole transfer layer  spiro-meotad  p3ht  ptaa  cuscn  cui  or nio   and absorber layer  ch3nh3pbixbr3-x  ch3nh3pbixcl3-x or ch3nh3pbi3   an electron transport layer  tio  zno  al2o3 or sno2  and a top contact layer  fluorine doped tin oxide or tin doped indium oxide  
there are a limited number of published studies to address the environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells 
the major environmental concern is the lead used in the absorber layer  due to the instability of perovskite cells lead may eventually be exposed to fresh water during the use phase  these lca studies looked at human and ecotoxicity of perovskite solar cells and found they were surprisingly low and may not be an environmental issue  global warming potential of perovskite pvs were found to be in the range of 241500 grams co2-eq kwh electricity production  similarly  reported epbt of the published paper range from 0.2 to 15 years  the large range of reported values highlight the uncertainties associated with these studies  celik et al   2016  critically discussed the assumptions made in perovskite pv lca studies 
two new promising thin film technologies are
 cu2znsns4 or czts  and
 zn3p2   both of these thin films are currently only produced in the lab but may be commercialized in the future  their manufacturing processes are expected to be similar to those of current thin film technologies of cigs and cdte  respectively  yet  contrary to cigs and cdte  czts and zn3p2 are made from earth abundant  nontoxic materials and have the potential to produce more electricity annually than the current worldwide consumption  while czts and zn3p2 offer good promise for these reasons  the specific environmental implications of their commercial production are not yet known  global warming potential of czts and zn3p2 were found 38 and 30 grams co2-eq kwh while their corresponding epbt were found 1.85 and 0.78 years  respectively  overall  cdte and zn3p2 have similar environmental impacts but can slightly outperform cigs and czts 
and
 opv  are a relatively new area of research  the tradition opv cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode  electron blocking layer  tunnel junction  holes blocking layer  electrode  with the sun hitting the transparent electrode  opv replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly  opv are flexible  low weight  and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production  opv uses  only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times   current efficiencies range from 16.5   however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10  efficiency 
many different configurations of opv exist using different materials for each layer  opv technology rivals existing pv technologies in terms of epbt even if they currently present a shorter operational lifetime  a 2013 study analyzed 12 different configurations all with 2  efficiency  the epbt ranged from 0.290.52 years for 1 m of pv  the average co2-eq kwh for opv is 54.922 grams 
economics  
source  apricus
there have been major changes in the underlying costs  industry structure and market prices of solar photovoltaics technology  over the years  and gaining a coherent picture of the shifts occurring across the industry value chain globally is a challenge  this is due to   the rapidity of cost and price changes  the complexity of the pv supply chain  which involves a large number of manufacturing processes  the balance of system  bos  and installation costs associated with complete pv systems  the choice of different distribution channels  and differences between regional markets within which pv is being deployed   further complexities result from the many different policy support initiatives that have been put in place to facilitate photovoltaics commercialisation in various countries 
the pv industry has seen dramatic drops in module prices since 2008  in late 2011  factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the  1.00 w mark  the  1.00 w installed cost  is often regarded in the pv industry as marking the achievement of
for pv  technological advancements  manufacturing process improvements  and industry re-structuring  mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years 
  such as   have often been offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems  government has sometimes also offered incentives in order to encourage the pv industry to achieve the
needed to compete where the cost of pv-generated electricity is above the cost from the existing grid  such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial  
job creation and reduction of
which cause global warming  due to economies of scale solar panels get less costly as people use and buy moreas manufacturers increase production to meet demand  the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come 
solar cell efficiencies vary from 6  for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0  with multiple-junction   solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around 1422   concentrated photovoltaics  cpv  may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns  through magnifying lens  onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell  however  such concentrated solar power requires sophisticated heat sink designs  otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats  which reduces its efficiency and life  to further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design  the heat sink must be passive  otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy 
crystalline silicon solar cell prices have fallen from  76.67 watt in 1977 to an estimated  0.74 watt in 2013  this is seen as evidence supporting   an observation similar to the famous
that states that solar cell prices fall 20  for every doubling of industry capacity 
as of 2011  the price of pv modules has fallen by 60  since the summer of 2008  according to bloomberg new energy finance estimates  putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries  an alternative and consistent price decline figure of 75  from 2007 to 2012 has also been published  though it is unclear whether these figures are specific to the united states or generally global  the levelised cost of electricity    from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions  particularly when the time of generation is included  as electricity is worth more during the day than at night  there has been fierce competition in the supply chain  and further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar lie ahead  posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years  as time progresses  renewable energy technologies generally get cheaper  while fossil fuels generally get more expensive 
the less solar power costs  the more favorably it compares to conventional power  and the more attractive it becomes to utilities and energy users around the globe  utility-scale solar power can now be delivered in california at prices well below  100 mwh   0.10 kwh  less than most other peak generators  even those running on low-cost natural gas  lower solar module costs also stimulate demand from consumer markets where the cost of solar compares very favorably to retail electric rates 
history for conventional    solar cells since 1977 
as of 2011  the cost of pv has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further  the average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the solarbuzz group fell from  3.50 watt to  2.43 watt over the course of 2011 
for large-scale installations  prices below  1.00 watt were achieved  a module price of 0.60 euro watt   0.78 watt  was published for a large scale 5-year deal in april 2012 
by the end of 2012  the  best in class  module price had dropped to  0.50 watt  and was expected to drop to  0.36 watt by 2017 
in many locations  pv has reached grid parity  which is usually defined as pv production costs at or below retail electricity prices  though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs   however  in many countries there is still a need for more access to capital to develop pv projects  to solve this problem
has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects  for example 
offered  the first u s 
in the solar industry in 2013 
photovoltaic power is also generated during a time of day that is close to peak demand  precedes it  in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning  more generally  it is now evident that  given a carbon price of  50 ton  which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c kwh  solar pv will be cost-competitive in most locations  the declining price of pv has been reflected in rapidly growing installations  totaling about 23gw in 2011  although some consolidation is likely in 2012  due to support cuts in the large markets of germany and italy  strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade  already  by one estimate  total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation 
in the case of self consumption payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid  additionally  using pv solar power to charge dc batteries  as used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles  leads to greater efficiencies  traditionally  dc generated electricity from solar pv must be converted to ac for buildings  at an average 10  loss during the conversion  an additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to dc for battery driven devices and vehicles  and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from  2,057.13 to  8,213.64  analysis from 2009  
for example  in germany with electricity prices of 0.25 euro kwh and
of 900 kwh kw one kwp will save 225 euro per year and with installation cost of 1700 euro kwp means that the system will pay back in less than 7 years 
manufacturing

overall the manufacturing process of creating solar photovoltaics is simple in that it does not require the culmination of many complex or moving parts  because of the solid state nature of pv systems they often have relatively long lifetimes  anywhere from 10 to 30 years  in order to increase electrical output of a pv system the manufacturer must simply add more photovoltaic components and because of this economies of scale are important for manufacturers as costs decrease with increasing output 
while there are many types of pv systems known to be effective  crystalline silicon pv accounted for around 90  of the worldwide production of pv in 2013  manufacturing silicon pv systems has several steps  first  polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure  semi-conductor grade   this is melted down when small amounts of boron  a group iii element  are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes  typically using a seed crystal  an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline  the ingot may also be cast in a mold  wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws  and then go through surface etching before being cleaned  next  the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus  a group v element  which creates an n-type semiconducting surface  to reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface  along with electrical contacts  after finishing the cell  cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation 
crystalline silicon photovoltaics are only one type of pv  and while they represent the majority of solar cells produced currently there are many new and promising technologies that have the potential to be scaled up to meet future energy needs 
another newer technology  thin-film pv  are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum  the substrate is often glass or stainless-steel  and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride  cdte   copper indium diselenide  cis   copper indium gallium diselenide  cigs   and amorphous silicon  a-si   after being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing  thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20  of the overall production of pv because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers 
other emerging pv technologies include organic  dye-sensitized  quantum-dot  and perovskite photovoltaics  opvs fall into the thin-film category of manufacturing  and typically operate around the 12  efficiency range which is lower than the 1221  typically seen by silicon based pvs  because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up  dye-sensitized pvs are similar in efficiency to opvs but are significantly easier to manufacture  however these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell  quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized dsscs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable  but currently they have not reached greater than 10  efficiency  perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes  but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture 
applications  
photovoltaic systems  
main article 
a photovoltaic system  or solar pv system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics  it consists of an arrangement of several components  including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity  a solar inverter to change the electric current from dc to ac  as well as mounting  cabling and other electrical accessories  pv systems range from small 
or
systems with capacities from a few to several tens of   to large utility-scale
of hundreds of   nowadays  most pv systems are   while
systems only account for a small portion of the market 
rooftop and building integrated systems
rooftop pv on half-timbered house
photovoltaic arrays are often associated with buildings  either integrated into them  mounted on them or mounted nearby on the ground 
are most often retrofitted into existing buildings  usually mounted on top of the existing roof structure or on the existing walls  alternatively  an array can be located separately from the building but connected by cable to supply power for the building 
 bipv  are increasingly incorporated into the roof or walls of new domestic and industrial buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power  roof tiles with integrated pv cells are sometimes used as well  provided there is an open gap in which air can circulate  rooftop mounted solar panels can provide a passive cooling effect on buildings during the day and also keep accumulated heat in at night  typically  residential rooftop systems have small capacities of around 510kw  while commercial rooftop systems often amount to several hundreds of kilowatts  although rooftop systems are much smaller than ground-mounted utility-scale power plants  they account for most of the worldwide installed capacity 
concentrator photovoltaics
 cpv  is a photovoltaic technology that contrary to conventional flat-plate pv systems uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small  but highly efficient 
 mj  solar cells  in addition  cpv systems often use
and sometimes a cooling system to further increase their efficiency  ongoing research and development is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the utility-scale segment and in areas of high solar  
photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector
 pvt  are systems that convert solar radiation into
and electrical energy  these systems combine a solar pv cell  which converts sunlight into electricity  with a   which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the pv module  the capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher
and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar pv or solar thermal alone 
power stations
satellite image of the
many utility-scale
have been constructed all over the world  as of 2015  the 579-megawatt  mwac 
is the world s largest   followed by the
and the   both with a capacity of 550 mwac  constructed by us-company   using   a
pv technology  all three power stations are located in the californian desert  many solar farms around the world are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative solar tracking systems that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems  there are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations 
rural electrification
where many villages are often more than five kilometers away from grid power are increasingly using photovoltaics  in remote locations in india a rural lighting program has been providing solar powered
lighting to replace kerosene lamps  the solar powered lamps were sold at about the cost of a few months  supply of kerosene  cuba is working to provide solar power for areas that are off grid  more complex applications of off-grid solar energy use include  
3d printers have been solar powered with photovoltaic technology  which enables
for   these are areas where the social costs and benefits offer an excellent case for going solar  though the lack of profitability has relegated such endeavors to humanitarian efforts  however  in 1995 solar rural electrification projects had been found to be difficult to sustain due to unfavorable economics  lack of technical support  and a legacy of ulterior motives of north-to-south technology transfer 
standalone systems
standalone pv system at an ecotourism resort      
until a decade or so ago  pv was used frequently to power calculators and novelty devices  improvements in integrated circuits and low power
make it possible to power such devices for several years between battery changes  making pv use less common  in contrast  solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive  such applications include   water pumps        temporary traffic signs  charging stations  and remote guard posts and signals 
floatovoltaics
in may 2008  the far niente winery in oakville  ca pioneered the world s first  floatovoltaic  system by installing 994 photovoltaic solar panels onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery s irrigation pond  the floating system generates about 477kw of peak output and when combined with an array of cells located adjacent to the pond is able to fully offset the winery s electricity consumption  the primary benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose  in the case of the far niente winery  the floating system saved three-quarters of an acre that would have been required for a land-based system  that land area can instead be used for agriculture  another benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that the panels are kept at a lower temperature than they would be on land  leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion  the floating panels also reduce the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibit the growth of algae 
in transport
2  a
pv has traditionally been used for electric power in space  pv is rarely used to provide motive power in transport applications  but is being used increasingly to provide auxiliary power in boats and cars  some automobiles are fitted with solar-powered air conditioning to limit interior temperatures on hot days  a self-contained
would have limited power and utility  but a solar-charged
allows use of solar power for transportation  solar-powered cars  boats and airplanes have been demonstrated  with the most practical and likely of these being   the swiss     achieved the
and plan to make the first solar-powered
of the globe in 2015 
telecommunication and signaling
solar pv power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange  radio and tv broadcasting  microwave and other forms of electronic communication links  this is because  in most telecommunication application  storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically dc  in hilly and mountainous terrain  radio and tv signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain  at these locations 
are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population 
spacecraft applications
part of  s solar array
are usually the sole source of power to run the sensors  active heating and cooling  and communications  a battery stores this energy for use when the solar panels are in shadow  in some  the power is also used for   spacecraft were one of the earliest applications of photovoltaics  starting with the silicon solar cells used on the
satellite  launched by the us in 1958  since then  solar power has been used on missions ranging from the
probe to mercury  to as far out in the solar system as the
probe to jupiter  the largest solar power system flown in space is the   to increase the power generated per kilogram  typical spacecraft solar panels use high-cost  high-efficiency  and close-packed rectangular
made of
 gaas  and other semiconductor materials 
specialty power systems
photovoltaics may also be incorporated as energy conversion devices for objects at elevated temperatures and with preferable radiative emissivities such as  
advantages  
the 122 of sunlight reaching the earth s surface is plentifulalmost 10,000 times more than the 13tw equivalent of average power consumed in 2005 by humans  this abundance leads to the suggestion that it will not be long before solar energy will become the world s primary energy source  additionally  solar electric generation has the highest power density  global mean of 170w m2  among renewable energies 
solar power is pollution-free during use  production end-wastes and emissions are manageable using existing pollution controls  end-of-use recycling technologies are under development and policies are being produced that encourage recycling from producers 
pv installations can operate for 100 years or even more with little maintenance or intervention after their initial set-up  so after the initial
of building any solar power plant 
are extremely low compared to existing power technologies 
grid-connected solar electricity can be used locally thus reducing transmission distribution losses  transmission losses in the us were approximately 7.2  in 1995  
compared to fossil and nuclear energy sources  very little research money has been invested in the development of solar cells  so there is considerable room for improvement  nevertheless  experimental
already have efficiencies of over 40  in case of concentrating photovoltaic cells and efficiencies are rapidly rising while mass-production costs are rapidly falling 
in some states of the united states  much of the investment in a home-mounted system may be lost if the home-owner moves and the buyer puts less value on the system than the seller  the city of
developed an innovative financing method to remove this limitation  by adding a tax assessment that is transferred with the home to pay for the solar panels  now known as   property assessed clean energy  30 u s  states have duplicated this solution 
there is evidence  at least in california  that the presence of a home-mounted solar system can actually increase the value of a home  according to a paper published in april 2011 by the ernest orlando lawrence berkeley national laboratory titled an analysis of the effects of residential photovoltaic energy systems on home sales prices in california 
the research finds strong evidence that homes with pv systems in california have sold for a premium over comparable homes without pv systems  more specifically  estimates for average pv premiums range from approximately  3.9 to  6.4 per installed watt  dc  among a large number of different model specifications  with most models coalescing near  5.5 watt  that value corresponds to a premium of approximately  17,000 for a relatively new 3,100 watt pv system  the average size of pv systems in the study
