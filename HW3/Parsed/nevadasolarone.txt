nevada solar one is a
plant  with a nominal capacity of 64 and maximum steam turbine power output up to 72mw net  75mw gross   spread over an area of 400 acres  160ha   the projected
emissions avoided is equivalent to taking approximately 20,000 cars off the road annually  the project required an investment of  266 million   and the project officially went to operation in june 2007  electricity production is estimated to be 134 million
per year 
it is the second
 ste  power plant built in the united states in more than 16 years  and the largest ste plant built in the world since 1991  it is located in
in the southwest fringe of     and was built in that city s energy resource zone  which requires renewable generation as part of plant development permits  nevada solar one was approved as part of  s larger el dorado energy project that built 1
of electrical generation capacity  the solar trough generation was built by acciona solar power  a partially owned subsidiary of spanish conglomerate  
 abilene  tx  was the epc contractor for the project  acciona purchased a 55 percent stake in solargenix  formerly duke solar  and acciona owns 95 percent of the project  nevada solar one is unrelated to the

history  
in 2006  located 30 miles north of tucson 
saguaro solar facility opened  with 1 mwof electrical generation capacity  nevada solar one went online for commercial use on june 27  2007  it uses similar technology and was constructed over a period of 16 months  the total project site is approximately 400
 0.6mi   1.6km   while the solar collectors cover 300 acres  1.2km2  
technology  
nevada solar one uses proprietary technology to track the suns location and concentrate its rays during peak demand hours  the plant uses 760
concentrators with more than 182,000 mirrors that concentrate the suns rays onto more than 18,240 receiver tubes placed at the focal axis of the troughs and containing a heat transfer fluid  solar receivers   fluid that heats up to 735f  391c  flows through these tubes and is used to produce steam that drives a
sst-700   adapted to the specific requirements of the csp technology  which is connected to a generator to produce electricity 
the mirrors are manufactured by flabeg ag in germany  in contrast to the
concept that california s original solar one project uses  the specially coated tubes  made of glass and steel  were designed and produced by
as well as by
in germany  motion control was supplied by   from components by  
solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands  such as the southwestern united states  using thermal energy storage systems  solar thermal operating periods can be extended to meet base load needs  given nevada s land and sun resources the state has the theoretical ability to have more than 600gw of electrical generation capacity using solar thermal concentrators like those used by nevada solar one  it has been proposed that massive expansion of solar plants such as nevada solar one has the potential to provide sufficient electricity to power the entire united states 
facilities have been successfully operating in  s mojave desert commercially since 1984 with a combined generating capacity of 354mw from the   about 30
plants are operating in
 see   and more are in construction or proposed  and two 110mw plants in  
production

nevada solar one in fiction  
in the video game
the station is named  helios one  and is under the control of the new california republic  the station is depicted to be in bad shape and under the command of an uncompetent scientist called  fantastic   who mentions that the station s output is at 1  of its full capacity
