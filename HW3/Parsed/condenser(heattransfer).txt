the condenser coil of a refrigerator
in systems involving   a condenser is a device or unit used to
a substance from its
to its
state  by cooling it  in so doing  the
is given up by the substance  and will transfer to the condenser coolant  condensers are typically
which have various designs and come in many sizes ranging from rather small  hand-held  to very large industrial-scale units used in plant processes  for example  a
uses a condenser to get rid of
extracted from the interior of the unit to the outside air  condensers are used in   industrial
such as   steam
and other heat-exchange systems  use of cooling water or surrounding air as the coolant is common in many condensers

examples of condensers  
a
is an example of such a heat-exchange system  it is a
installed at the outlet of every
in   commonly  the
flows through the tube side and the steam enters the shell side where the condensation occurs on the outside of the heat transfer tubes  the condensate drips down and collects at the bottom  often in a built-in pan called a hotwell  the shell side often operates at a
or partial vacuum  produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate  conversely  the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside 
in   a condenser is the apparatus which cools hot   causing them to condense into a   see    for -scale condensers  as opposed to industrial-scale condensers  examples include the     and   this is not to be confused with a
which links two fragments into a single molecule by an addition
and an elimination reaction 
in laboratory     and   several types of condensers are commonly used  the liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a cooling water jacket  and is the simplest  and relatively least expensive  form of condenser  the graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket  and the allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube  each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense  being more complex shapes to manufacture  these latter types are also more expensive to purchase  these three types of condensers are
items since they are typically made of glass  commercially available condensers usually are fitted with ground glass joints and come in standard lengths of 100  200  and 400 mm  air-cooled condensers are unjacketed  while water-cooled condensers contain a jacket for the water 
larger condensers are also used in industrial-scale distillation processes to cool distilled
into liquid distillate  commonly  the coolant flows through the tube side and distilled vapor through the shell side with distillate collecting at or flowing out the bottom 
condenser unit for central air conditioning for a typical house
a condenser unit used in
systems typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming
vapor into liquid  a
to raise the pressure of the refrigerant and move it along  and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside  a typical configuration of such a condenser unit is as follows  the heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside  in this heat exchanger section  the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes  which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit  there is a motorized
inside the condenser unit near the top  which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan  the fan is used to blow the outside cooling air in through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating  these condenser units are located on the outside of the building they are trying to cool  with tubing between the unit and building  one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit  of course  an
supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit 
direct contact condenser
in this type of condenser 
are poured into the liquid directly  the vapors lose their
of vaporization  hence  vapors transfer their heat into liquid and the liquid becomes hot  in this type of condensation  the vapor and liquid are of same type of substance  in another type of direct contact condenser  cold water is sprayed into the vapour to be condensed

in the world of
 hvac   condensers happen to be a topic of great importance  instead of confusing information  the goal is to provide some basic information on the different types of condensers and their applications 
there are three other condensers used in hvac systems
water-cooled
air-cooled
evaporative
applications 
air cooled  if the condenser is located on the outside of the unit  the air cooled condenser can provide the easiest arrangement  these types of condensers eject heat to the outdoors and are simple to install 
most common uses for this condenser are domestic refrigerators  upright freezers and in residential packaged air conditioning units  a great feature of the air cooled condenser is they are very easy to clean  since dirt can cause serious issues with the condensers performance  it is highly recommended that these be kept clear of dirt 
water cooled  although a little more pricey to install  these condensers are the more efficient type  commonly used for swimming pools and condensers piped for city water flow  these condensers require regular service and maintenance 
they also require a cooling tower to conserve water  to prevent corrosion and the forming of algae  water cooled condensers require a constant supply of makeup water along with water treatment 
depending on the application you can choose from tube in tube  shell and coil or shell and tube condensers  all are essentially made to produce the same outcome  but each in a different way 
evaporative  while these remain the least popular choice  evaporative condensers can be used inside or outside of a building and under typical conditions  operate at a low condensing temperature 
typically these are used in large commercial air-conditioning units  although effective  they are not necessarily the most efficient 
prior to beginning your install  make sure you choose a condenser that will provide you with the most efficient use
