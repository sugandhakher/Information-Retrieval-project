the  s ecodesign directive  directive 2009/125 ec  establishes a framework to set mandatory ecological requirements for energy-using and energy-related products sold in all 28 member states  its scope currently covers more than 40 product groups  such as    
and    which are responsible for around 40  of all eu
emissions 
the 2009 revision of the directive extended its scope to energy-related products such as  
materials and certain water-using products 
the ultimate aim of the ecodesign directive is that manufacturers of energy-using products will  at the design stage  be obliged to reduce the
and other negative
of products  while the directive s primary aim is to reduce   it is also aimed at enforcing other environmental considerations including  materials use     
issues and  
the ecodesign directive is a   meaning that it does not directly set minimum ecological requirements  these are adopted through specific implementing measures for each group of products in the scope of the directive  the implementing measures are adopted through the so-called
procedure  implementing measures are based on eu internal market rules governing which products may be placed on the market  manufacturers who begin marketing an energy using product covered by an implementing measure in the eu area have to ensure that it conforms to the energy and environmental standards set out by the measure 
in practice  the introduction of a new minimum requirement results in effectively banning all non-compliant products from being sold in the 28 member states  this was for example the case of   for which a gradual phaseout started in the eu in 2009 under this directive  this measure alone  which received some criticism in parts of the media but welcomed by environmentalists  is expected to reduce annual co2 emissions by 16 million tons in 2020 
scope of the directive  
the 2005 ecodesign directive covered energy-using products  which use  generate  transfer or measure energy  including consumer goods such as boilers    computers  televisions  and industrial products such as   the implementing measures focus on those products which have a high potential for reducing
at low cost  through reduced  
the first working plan of the ecodesign directive was adopted on 21 october 2008 
it establishes a list of 10 product groups to be considered in priority for implementing measures in 20092011 
and
systems  including
electric and
heating equipment
food-preparing equipment
industrial and laboratory
and ovens
network  data processing and data storing equipment
refrigerating and freezing equipment
sound and imaging equipment
transformers
water-using equipment
nine implementing measures have already been adopted  for a total
of 341 twh  or 12  of the
of the eu  several preparatory studies by dg energy are completed or ongoing 
the european commission will be tabling a circular economy proposal towards the end of 2015 
is likely to be discussed within this framework
