movement and was often called to give press interviews  as a result he was denounced as a    by groups such as
and   he was attacked by security guards  who allegedly drove a metal spike through his foot  smashing the middle metatarsal bone  his injuries left him in hospital  sir   a former british diplomat at the united nations  who was then
at   made the young protester a   he was an active member of the pure genius   campaign and co-founded   which has occupied land at several locations in britain  its first high-profile success was in 1997  when it occupied thirteen
 five   of prime real estate on the river in london on which its owner  beverages multinational   intended to build a superstore  the protesters defeated diageo in court  built an     and held on to the land for six months 
among his best-known articles are his critique of  s climate science  his description of an encounter with a
in brazil  his attack on
interpretations of genetics  his discussion of the ethics of   and his attack on the politics of
and  
in january 2011  monbiot took the unusual step of publishing an account of his assets  in the interests of transparency  monbiot explained that he earned 77,400 a year  gross  from publishing contracts and rents  and urged other journalists to follow suit  he continues to publish his financial accounts on his website 
he has held
at the universities of
 environmental policy  
 philosophy  
 politics  
 planning   and
 environmental science    
monbiot lived in
for many years  but in 2007 moved with his then-wife  writer and campaigner angharad penrhyn jones  and daughter to a
in the mid-wales market town of   monbiot s second daughter was born in the spring of 2012  because his new partner lives in oxford  monbiot had returned there by 2013 
in november 2012  he apologised to
for his  stupidity and thoughtlessness  in implying  in a tweet  that the tory peer was a paedophile  in march 2013  monbiot announced on his blog the details of a settlement reached with lord mcalpine s representatives  monbiot agreed  to carry out  over the next three years  work on behalf of three charities of my choice whose value amounts to 25,000   which he described as an  unprecedented settlement  
activism  
climate change  
monbiot believes that drastic action coupled with strong political will is needed to combat   monbiot has written that
is the  moral question of the 21st century  and that there is an urgent need for a number of emergency actions he believes will stop climate change  including  setting targets on
using the latest science  issuing every citizen with a  personal carbon ration   new building regulations with houses built to german
standards  banning   patio heaters  garden floodlights  and other inefficient technologies and wasteful applications  constructing large offshore   replacing the national gas grid with a
pipe network  a new national coach network to make journeys using
faster than using a car  all petrol stations to supply leasable electric
with stations equipped with a crane service to replace depleted batteries  scrap road-building and road-widening programmes  redirecting their budgets to tackle climate change  reduce uk airport capacity by 90 percent  closing down all out-of-town superstores and replacing them with warehouses and a delivery system 
monbiot says the campaign against climate change is  unlike almost all the public protests  that came before it   it is a campaign not for abundance but for austerity  it is a campaign not for more freedom but for less  strangest of all  it is a campaign not just against other people  but against ourselves  
monbiot also thinks that economic recession can be a good thing for the planet   is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land  and should seek to stay there  why would we want to leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse  surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible   while he does recognize that recession can cause hardship  he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well  for example  the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth  but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution 
monbiot purchased a used diesel
after moving to
in 2007  he has travelled through canada and the united states  campaigning on climate change and promoting his book  he contends that this travel was justifiable as it sought to boost the case for much greater carbon cuts there 
he is the
of the uk student campaign network
and appears in the film
in animated form  in which he says  the very fact that the crisis is taking place within our generation  it s happening right now  means that we are tremendously powerful people  so this position of despair and  i can t do anything  and  there s no point  is completely illogical  it s exactly the opposite  
monbiot attended the
held in  
monbiot once expressed deep antipathy to the   he finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in march 2011  although he  still loathe s  the liars who run the nuclear industry   monbiot now advocates its use  having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the
on nuclear reactors in the region  subsequently  he has harshly condemned the   writing that it  has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health   made  claims  ungrounded in science  unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong   he singled out
for  he wrote  making unsourced and inaccurate claims  dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up  and overstating the death toll from the
by a factor of more than 140  in october 2013 monbiot criticized the selection of a
design for the
due to
as well as for a half century requirement of
and
production  he contrasted this with two
concepts   if
were deployed  the uk s stockpile of
could be used to generate enough
to meet all uk demand for 500 years  these reactors would keep recycling the waste until hardly any remained  solving three huge problemsenergy supply  nuclear waste and climate changeat once 
use an element that s already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted byproduct of other mining industries  they recycle their own waste  leaving almost nothing behind      
in 2012  monbiot claimed that there was more than enough oil for  industry and consumer capitalism  to  deep-fry the lot of us   citing a report of 110 million
per day in 2020 
debate with ian plimer  
monbiot harshly criticised the book
by
  saying that  since its publication in australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors  and its fudging and manipulation of the data   plimer challenged monbiot to a public debate on the issues covered in the book  monbiot agreed on the condition that plimer first answer a series of written questions for publication on the website of the guardian  so there would be a factual basis to the discussion  plimer refused and monbiot labeled plimer a  grandstander  with a  broad yellow streak  who has nowhere answered the accusations of serious errors in his heaven and earth book  and accused him of trying to  drown out the precise refutations published by his book s reviewers   plimer then reversed his decision  and agreed to answer written questions in return for a live debate  monbiot s response on receiving plimer s contribution was one of disappointment  on the grounds that plimer s response  so far consists not of answers  but of questions addressed to me   monbiot told plimer that he is not qualified to answer plimer s questions  although
of
did answer them   on 2 september 2009  monbiot published another column in the guardian asking   is ian plimer ever going to answer my questions   and suggested that plimer was evading the questions by using the   a debate was subsequently held on 15 december  while monbiot was in copenhagen  on the  s
programme  moderated by  
attempted arrest of john bolton  
monbiot made an unsuccessful attempt to carry out a
of   a former u s  ambassador to the united nations  when the latter attended the
to give a talk on international relations in may 2008  monbiot argued that bolton was one of the instigators of the iraq war  of which monbiot was an opponent 
political parties  
he was involved initially with the
political party  but he broke with the organisation when it chose to run candidates against the
in the 2004 election to the european parliament  in an interview with the british political blog third estate in september 2009  monbiot expressed his support for the policies of   saying  i have finally found the party that i feel very comfortable with  thats not to say i feel uncomfortable with the green party  on the whole i support it  but i feel even more comfortable with plaid  
in april 2010  he was a signatory to an open letter of support for the   published in the guardian  prior to the   he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the  s  
indigenous rights  
monbiot has been associated with the cause of   and has sought to denounce threats to tribal people  at the face of corporate interests  he contributed to the 2009 book we are one  a celebration of tribal peoples  which explores the culture of peoples around the world  portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces 
published works  
monbiot s first book was
 1989   a work of investigative travel journalism exposing what he called the  devastating effects  of the partially -funded
on the peoples and tribes of
and
in   it was followed by
 1991  which documented expulsions of brazilian peasant farmers from their land and followed them thousands of miles across the forest to the territory of the
indians  and showed how timber sold in britain was being stolen from indigenous and biological reserves in   his third book 
 1994   documented the seizure of land and cattle from
in
and the   byamong other forcesgame parks and safari tourism 
in 2000  he published captive state  the corporate takeover of britain  the book examines the role of corporate power in the united kingdom  on both local and national levels  and argues that corporate involvement in politics is a serious threat to democracy  subjects discussed in the book include the building of the   corporate involvement in the   the role of business in university research  and the conditions which influence the granting of  
monbiot at a
rally in scotland
the age of consent  
his fifth book  the age of consent  a manifesto for a new world order  was published in 2003  the book is an attempt to set out a positive manifesto for change for the   monbiot criticises
and   arguing that any possible solution to the world s inequalities must be rooted in a democratic parliamentary system  the four main changes to
which monbiot argues for are a democratically elected
which would pass resolutions on international issues  a democratised
to replace the unelected   the proposed
which would automatically discharge
and prevent the accumulation of debt  and a
organisation which would regulate
in a way that protects the economies of poorer countries 
the book also discusses ways in which these ideas may be put into practice  he posits that the united states and western european states are heavily dependent on the existence of this debt  and that when faced with a choice between releasing the developing world from debt and the collapse of the global economy  their internal economic interests will dictate that they opt for the  soft landing  option  however  monbiot emphasises that he does not present the manifesto as a  final or definitive  answer to global inequalities but intends that it should open debate and stresses that those who reject it must offer their own solutions  he argues that ultimately the global justice movement  must seek   to provide a coherent programme of alternatives to the concentrated power of the dictatorship of vested interests  
heat  
monbiot s next book  heat  how to stop the planet burning  published in 2006  focuses on the issue of   he points out that the public opinion campaign to cast doubt on the reality of climate change is funded by fossil-fuel companies  primarily    and traces the  network of fake citizens  groups and bogus scientific bodies  campaigning to discredit climate science to origins in a campaign by tobacco companies to create a facade of science to cast doubt on the link between cigarette smoking and disease  he argues that a 90 percent reduction in
is necessary in developed countries in order to prevent disastrous changes to the climate  he then sets out to demonstrate how such a reduction could be achieved within the united kingdom  without a significant fall in   through changes in housing  power supply  and transport 
feral  
feral  searching for enchantment on the frontiers of rewilding was published in 2013  and focuses on the concept of
the planet  monbiot states  rewilding offers a positive environmentalism  environmentalists have long known what they are against  now we can explain what we are for  
in the book  monbiot attacks
as  a slow-burning ecological disaster  which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution  yet scarcely anyone seems to have noticed   he particularly looks at  
the book received favourable reviews  including in publications normally hostile to his work  such as
and   it won the
book award for general biology in 2014
