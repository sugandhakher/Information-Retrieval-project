at its crux  environmentalism is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend in such a way that all the components are accorded a proper degree of   the exact measures and outcomes of this balance is controversial and there are many different ways for environmental concerns to be expressed in practice  environmentalism and environmental concerns are often represented by the color   but this association has been appropriated by the marketing industries for the tactic known as   environmentalism is opposed by   which says that the earth is less fragile than some environmentalists maintain  and portrays environmentalism as overreacting to the human contribution to

a concern for environmental protection has recurred in diverse forms  in different parts of the world  throughout history  for example  in europe

treatises during the 9th to 13th centuries dealing with environmentalism and   including pollution  were written by                       ibn al-quff  and   their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution  such as air pollution

discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste  the first large-scale  modern environmental laws came in the form of britain s   passed in 1863  to regulate the deleterious air pollution     given off by the   used to produce   an alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution  the responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded  culminating in the alkali order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted   grit  dust and fumes under supervision 
in industrial cities local experts and reformers  especially after 1890  took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution  and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms  typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution  the
was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental ngos  it was founded by artist sir   frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke  although there were earlier pieces of legislation  the
required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke  it also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke  the provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the smoke abatement act to include other emissions  such as soot  ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations 
it was  however  only under the impetus of the
of 1952 in london  which almost brought the city to a standstill and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths that the
was passed and pollution in the city was finally brought to an end  financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives  such as installing gas fires   or for those who preferred  to burn coke instead  a byproduct of town gas production  which produces minimal smoke   smoke control areas  were introduced in some towns and cities in which only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities  the act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism  and caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people s quality of life 
the late 19th century also saw the passage of the first wildlife conservation laws  the zoologist
published a series of investigations into the desirability of establishing a  close-time  for the preservation of indigenous animals between 1872 and 1903  his advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the

systematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century  it grew out of the amenity movement in britain in the 1870s  which was a reaction to   the growth of cities  and worsening air and   starting with the formation of the

in 1893 hill  hunter and rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country  the  national trust for places of historic interest or natural beauty  was formally inaugurated in 1894  the organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 national trust bill  which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation  and the bill was passed in august 1907 
an early  back-to-nature  movement  which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism  was advocated by intellectuals such as    
and   who were all against  
and other activities that were harmful to the natural world  the movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns  where sanitation was awful  pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped  idealists championed the rural life as a mythical

practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions  without the  taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality   were enthusiastically revived  including the

control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial  the book s legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment  with this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills  and environmental interest grew  new pressure groups formed  notably
and   as well as notable local organizations such as the   which was founded in 1967 
in the 1970s  the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the

by literally hugging trees  leading to the term  tree huggers    their peaceful methods of protest and slogan  ecology is permanent economy  were very influential 
another milestone in the movement was the creation of an   earth day was first observed in
and other cities on march 21  1970  the first day of spring  it was created to give awareness to environmental issues  on march 21  1971  united nations secretary-general u thant spoke of a

the earth supplies to us  and hence our obligation to protect it  and with it  ourselves   earth day is now coordinated globally by the   and is celebrated in more than 175 countries every year 
the un s first major conference on international environmental issues  the
 also known as the stockholm conference   was held on june 516  1972  it marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics 
by the mid-1970s  many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe  the

sentiments and other political issues  these individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as   around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the
in 1973 and the formation of
in 1975  significant amendments were also enacted to the united states
and  
in 1979    a british scientist  published gaia  a new look at life on earth  which put forth the   it proposes that life on
can be understood as a single organism  this became an important part of the
ideology  throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this deep green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists 
today  
environmentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as

recent research demonstrates a precipitous decline in the public s interest in 19 different areas of environmental concern  americans are less likely be actively participating in an environmental movement or organization and more likely to identify as  unsympathetic  to an environmental movement then in 2000  this is likely a lingering factor of the

the popular media have been used to convey conservation messages in the u s  for instance  the u s  forest service created

an alternative view  
many environmentalists believe that human interference with  nature  should be restricted or minimised as a matter of urgency  for the sake of life  or the planet  or just for the benefit of the human species   whereas
and anti-environmentalists do not believe that there is such a need    one can also regard oneself as an environmentalist and believe that human  interference  with  nature  should be increased  nevertheless  there is a risk that the shift from emotional environmentalism into the technical management of natural resources and hazards could decrease the touch of humans with nature  leading to less concern with environment preservation
