organization with offices in over 40 countries and with an international coordinating body in   the   founded by
and us ex-pat environmental activists in 1971  greenpeace states its goal is to  ensure the ability of the
to nurture
in all its   and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as           and
issues  it uses       and
to achieve its goals  the global organization does not accept funding from governments  corporations  or political parties  relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants  greenpeace has a
with the
and is a founding member of the   an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations 
greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world  greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge  and influenced both the private and the public sector  greenpeace has also been a source of controversy  its motives and methods  some of the latter being illegal  have received criticism  including an open letter from more than 100 nobel laureates urging greenpeace to end its campaign against
 gmos   the organization s direct actions have sparked legal actions against greenpeace   such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of
wheat and damaging the   a un world heritage site in peru

history  
origins  
location of amchitka island in alaska 
in the late 1960s  the u s  had plans for an underground
in the tectonically unstable island of
in   because of the   the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a   a 1969 demonstration of 7,000 people blocked a major u s canada border crossing in british columbia  carrying signs reading  don t make a wave  it s your fault if our fault goes   the protests did not stop the u s  from detonating the bomb 
while no earthquake or tsunami followed the test  the opposition grew when the u s  announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one  among the opposers were   a veteran who had served in the u s  navy  and
and   who had recently become   as members of the   they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization  from irving stowe  jim bohlen learned of a form of    bearing witness   where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence  jim bohlen s wife marie came up with the idea to sail to amchitka  inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of
in 1958  the idea ended up in the press and was linked to the sierra club  the sierra club did not like this connection and in 1970 the
was established for the protest  early meetings were held in the shaughnessy home of
and his wife bobbi hunter  subsequently  the stowe home at 2775 courtenay street became the headquarters  as
put it in his chronology  greenpeace  in 1969  irving and dorothy stowe s  quiet home on courtenay street would soon become a hub of monumental  global significance   some of the first greenpeace meetings were held there  the first office was opened in a backroom  storefront on cypress and west broadway se corner in kitsilano  vancouver  within half a year greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with the society promoting environmental conservation at 4th and maple in  
arranged a
 supported by   that took place on october 16  1970 at the
in vancouver  the concert created the financial basis for the first greenpeace campaign 
was published by greenpeace in november 2009 on cd and is also available as an mp3 download via the amchitka concert website  using the money raised with the concert  the don t make a wave committee chartered a ship  the phyllis cormack owned and sailed by john cormack  the ship was renamed greenpeace for the protest after a term coined by activist bill darnell 
in the autumn of 1971  the ship sailed towards amchitka and faced the u s  coast guard ship
which forced the activists to turn back  because of this and the increasingly bad weather the crew decided to return to canada only to find out that the news about their journey and reported support from the crew of the confidence had generated sympathy for their protest  after this greenpeace tried to navigate to the test site with other vessels  until the u s  detonated the bomb  the nuclear test was criticized and the u s  decided not to continue with their test plans at amchitka 
founders and founding time of greenpeace  
environmental historian frank zelko dates the formation of the    to 1969 and according to jim bohlen the group adopted the name  don t make a wave committee  on 28 november 1969  according to the greenpeace web site  the don t make a wave committee was established in 1970  certificate of incorporation of the don t make a wave committee dates the incorporation to the fifth of october  1970  researcher vanessa timmer dates the official incorporation to 1971  greenpeace itself calls the protest voyage of 1971 as  the beginning   according to   who was an early member but has since distanced himself from greenpeace  and rex weyler  the name of  the don t make a wave committee  was officially changed to greenpeace foundation in 1972  because of the early phases spanning several years  there are differing views on who can be called the founders of greenpeace 
vanessa timmer has referred to the early members as  an unlikely group of loosely organized protestors   frank zelko has commented that  unlike   for example  which sprung fully formed from the forehead of   greenpeace developed in a more evolutionary manner  there was no single founder   greenpeace itself says on its web page that  there s a joke that in any bar in vancouver  canada  you can sit down next to someone who claims to have founded greenpeace  in fact  there was no single founder  name  idea  spirit and tactics can all be said to have separate lineages   patrick moore has said that  the truth is that greenpeace was always a work in progress  not something definitively founded like a country or a company  therefore there are a few shades of gray about who might lay claim to being a founder of greenpeace   early greenpeace director
says on his homepage that the insiders of greenpeace have debated about the founders since mid-1970s 
the current greenpeace web site lists the founders of the don t make a wave committee as dorothy and irving stowe  marie and jim bohlen  ben and dorothy metcalfe  and robert hunter  according to both patrick moore and an interview with dorothy stowe  dorothy metcalfe  jim bohlen and robert hunter  the founders of the don t make a wave committee were paul cote  irving and dorothy stowe and jim and marie bohlen 
  founder of the
maintains that he also was one of the founders of the don t make a wave committee and greenpeace  media sources concerning watson report him being one of the founders of greenpeace  with many articles reporting him being a founder in 1972  patrick moore has denied watson being one of the founders of the don t make a wave committee  and greenpeace in 1972  according to moore the already campaigning organization was  simply changing the name  in 1972  greenpeace has stated that watson was an influential early member  but not one of the founders of greenpeace  watson has since criticized greenpeace of rewriting their history 
because patrick moore was among the crew of the first protest voyage and the beginning of the journey is often referred as the birthday of greenpeace  moore also considers himself one of the founders  greenpeace used to list moore among  founders and first members  of but has later stated that while moore was a significant early member  he was not among the founders of greenpeace in 1970 
after amchitka  
after the office in the stowe home   and after the first concert fund-raiser  greenpeace functions moved to other private homes and held public meetings weekly on wednesday nights at the kitsilano neighborhood house before settling  in the autumn of 1974  in a small office shared with the spec environmental group at 2007 west 4th at maple in   when the nuclear tests at amchitka were over  greenpeace moved its focus to the french atmospheric
at the
in   the young organization needed help for their protests and were contacted by   a former businessman living in new zealand  in 1972 the yacht vega  a 12.5-metre  41ft  ketch owned by   was renamed greenpeace iii and sailed in an anti-nuclear protest into the exclusion zone at moruroa to attempt to disrupt french nuclear testing  this voyage was sponsored and organized by the new zealand branch of the   the
tried to stop the protest in several ways  including assaulting david mctaggart  mctaggart was supposedly beaten to the point that he lost sight in one of his eyes  however  one of mctaggart s crew members photographed the incident and went public  after the assault was publicized  france announced it would stop the atmospheric nuclear tests 
in the mid-1970s some greenpeace members started an independent campaign  project ahab  against commercial   since irving stowe was against greenpeace focusing on other issues than nuclear weapons    after irving stowe died in 1975  the phyllis cormack sailed from vancouver to face soviet whalers on the coast of california  greenpeace activists disrupted the whaling by placing themselves between the harpoons and the whales  and footage of the protests spread across the world  later in the 1970s  the organization widened its focus to include
and commercial  
the  greenpeace   was published by greenpeace in the greenpeace chronicles  winter 1976-77   this declaration was a condensation of a number of ecological manifestos
had written over the years 
organizational development  
  a former fire-fighter owned by the   was relaunched by greenpeace in 2002
greenpeace evolved from a group of canadian and american protesters into a less conservative group of environmentalists who were more reflective of the
and
youth movements of the 1960s and 1970s  the social and cultural background from which greenpeace emerged heralded a period of de-conditioning away from old world antecedents and sought to develop new codes of social  environmental and political behavior 
in the mid-1970s independent groups using the name greenpeace started springing up worldwide  by 1977 there were 15 to 20 greenpeace groups around the world  at the same time the canadian greenpeace office was heavily in debt  disputes between offices over fund-raising and organizational direction split the global movement as the north american offices were reluctant to be under the authority of the vancouver office and its president  
after the incidents of moruroa atoll  david mctaggart had moved to france to battle in court with the french state and helped to develop the cooperation of european greenpeace groups 
lobbied the canadian greenpeace foundation to accept a new structure which would bring the scattered greenpeace offices under the auspices of a single global organization  the european greenpeace paid the debt of the canadian greenpeace office and on october 14  1979  greenpeace international came into existence  under the new structure  the local offices would contribute a percentage of their income to the international organization  which would take responsibility for setting the overall direction of the movement with each regional office having one vote  some greenpeace groups  namely
 dissolved in 2001  and the us-based
 still operational  however decided to remain independent from greenpeace international 
organizational structure  
governance  
the governance and management structure of greenpeace 
greenpeace consists of greenpeace international  officially stichting greenpeace council  based in     and 26 regional offices operating in 55 countries  the regional offices work largely autonomously under the supervision of greenpeace international  the executive director of greenpeace is elected by the board members of greenpeace international  the current directors of greenpeace international are bunny mcdiarmaid and jennifer morgan and the current chair of the board is brazilian   greenpeace has a staff of 2,400 and 15,000 volunteers globally 
each regional office is led by a regional executive director elected by the regional board of directors  the regional boards also appoint a trustee to the greenpeace international annual general meeting  where the trustees elect or remove the board of directors of greenpeace international  the role of the annual general meeting is also to discuss and decide the overall principles and strategically important issues for greenpeace in collaboration with the trustees of regional offices and greenpeace international board of directors 
funding  
greenpeace receives its funding from individual supporters and foundations  greenpeace screens all major donations in order to ensure it does not receive unwanted donations  the organization does not accept money from governments  intergovernmental organizations  political parties or corporations in order to avoid their influence  however  greenpeace does receive money from the national postcode lottery  the biggest government-sponsored lottery in the netherlands  and several for profit companies like
partner with and indicate they donate a percentage of sales to greenpeace campaigns  donations from foundations which are funded by political parties or receive most of their funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations are rejected  foundation donations are also rejected if the foundations attach unreasonable conditions  restrictions or constraints on greenpeace activities or if the donation would compromise the independence and aims of greenpeace  since in the mid-1990s the number of supporters started to decrease  greenpeace pioneered the use of
where fundraisers actively seek new supporters at public places  subscribing them for a monthly direct debit donation  in 2008  most of the 202.5 million received by the organization was donated by about 2.6 million regular supporters  mainly from europe  in 2014  the annual revenue of greenpeace was reported to be about 300 million  us 400 million  although they lost about 4 million  us 5 million  in currency speculation that year 
greenpeace street fundraiser talking to a passer-by 
in september 2003 
 piw  complained to the
that greenpeace usa tax returns were inaccurate and in violation of the law  the irs conducted an extensive review and concluded in december 2005 that greenpeace usa continued to qualify for its tax-exempt status  in march 2006
reported that piw s  federal tax filing  covering august 2003 to july 2004  stated that  120,000 of the  124,095 the group received in contributions during that period came from exxon mobil   in 2013  after the irs performed a follow-up audit  which again was clean  and  following claims of politically motivated irs audits of groups affiliated with the   greenpeace u s  executive director
called for a congressional investigation into all politically motivated audits  including those allegedly targeting the tea party movement  the   and greenpeace

climate and energy  
an inflatable snow man conveying  stop global warming   at the
 2007 
greenpeace was one of the first parties to formulate a
scenario for climate change mitigation  which it did in 1993  according to sociologists marc mormont and christine dasnoy  greenpeace played a significant role in raising public awareness of global warming in the 1990s  the organization has also focused on   because of both their global warming potential and their effect on the ozone layer  greenpeace was one of the leading participants advocating early phase-out of ozone depleting substances in the   in the early 1990s  greenpeace developed a cfc-free refrigerator technology   greenfreeze  for mass production together with the refrigerator industry  united nations environment programme awarded greenpeace for  outstanding contributions to the protection of the earth s ozone layer  in 1997  in 2011 two fifths of the world s total production of refrigerators were based on greenfreeze technology  with over 600 million units in use 
currently greenpeace considers
to be the greatest environmental problem facing the earth  greenpeace calls for global
emissions to peak in 2015 and to decrease as close to zero as possible by 2050  for this greenpeace calls for the industrialized countries to cut their emissions at least 40  by 2020  from 1990 levels  and to give substantial funding for developing countries to build a sustainable energy capacity  to adapt to the inevitable consequences of global warming  and to stop
by 2020  together with   greenpeace has formulated a global energy scenario   energy  r evolution   where 80  of the world s total energy is produced with renewables  and the emissions of the energy sector are decreased by over 80  of the 1990 levels by 2050 
using direct action  greenpeace has protested several times against coal by occupying coal power plants and blocking coal shipments and mining operations  in places such as       and the   greenpeace is also critical of extracting petroleum from
and has used direct action to block the oil sand operations at    
kingsnorth court case  
in october 2007  six greenpeace protesters were arrested for breaking into the   climbing the 200 metre smokestack  painting the name
on the chimney  and causing an estimated 30,000 damage  at their subsequent trial they admitted trying to shut the station down  but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change from causing greater damage to property elsewhere around the world  evidence was heard from  s environment adviser   climate scientist
and an
leader from greenland  all saying that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world  the six activists were acquitted  it was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a  lawful excuse  defense in court  both
and
described the acquittal as embarrassment to the   in december 2008
listed the acquittal in its annual list of the most influential ideas of the year 
 go beyond oil   
as part of their stance on   greenpeace have launched the  go beyond oil  campaign  the campaign is focused on slowing  and eventually ending  the world s consumption of oil  with activist activities taking place against companies that pursue oil drilling as a venture  much of the activities of the  go beyond oil  campaign have been focused on drilling for oil in the arctic and areas affected by the
disaster  the activities of greenpeace in the arctic have mainly involved the edinburgh-based oil and gas exploration company  cairn energy  and range from protests at the cairn energy s headquarters to scaling their oil rigs in an attempt to halt the drilling process 
the  go beyond oil  campaign also involves applying political pressure on the governments who allow oil exploration in their territories  with the group stating that one of the key aims of the  go beyond oil  campaign is to  work to expose the lengths the oil industry is willing to go to squeeze the last barrels out of the ground and put pressure on industry and governments to move beyond oil  
nuclear power  
greenpeace views
as a relatively minor industry with major problems  such as environmental damage and risks from uranium mining  nuclear weapons proliferation  and unresolved questions concerning nuclear waste  the organization argues that the potential of nuclear power to
is marginal  referring to the
energy scenario where an increase in world s nuclear capacity from 2608 twh in 2007 to 9857 twh by 2050 would cut global greenhouse gas emissions less than 5  and require 32 nuclear reactor units of 1000mw capacity built per year until 2050  according to greenpeace the slow construction times  construction delays  and hidden costs  all negate the mitigation potential of nuclear power  this makes the iea scenario technically and financially unrealistic  they also argue that binding massive amounts of investments on nuclear energy would take funding away from more effective solutions  greenpeace views the construction of
nuclear power plant in
as an example of the problems on building new nuclear power 
anti-nuclear advertisement  
in 1994  greenpeace published an anti-nuclear newspaper advert which included a claim that nuclear facilities
would kill 2,000 people in the next 10 years  and an image of a -affected child said to be a victim of  
viewed the claim concerning sellafield unsubstantiated  and asa did not accept that the child s condition was caused by radiation  this resulted in banning of the advert  greenpeace did not admit fault  stating that a kazakhstan doctor had said that the child s condition was due to nuclear testing  adam woolf from greenpeace also stated that   fifty years ago there were many experts who would be lined up and swear there was no link between smoking and bad health   the un has estimated that the nuclear weapon tests in kazakhstan caused about 100,000 people to suffer over three generations 
edf spying conviction and appeal  
in 2011  a french court fined
 edf  1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on greenpeace  including hacking into greenpeace s computer systems  greenpeace was awarded 500,000 in damages  although edf claimed that a security firm had only been employed to monitor greenpeace  the court disagreed  jailing the head and deputy head of edf s nuclear security operation for three years each  edf appealed the conviction  the company was cleared of conspiracy to spy on greenpeace and the fine was cancelled  two employees of the security firm  kargus  run by a former member of france s secret services  received sentences of three and two years respectively 
cool it leaderboard  
in may 2009  greenpeace started evaluating it companies through cool it leaderboard  the central role these companies are playing gives the opportunity to drive changes in the energy sector and achieve a significant reduction in the greenhouse gases that cause the climate change 
the leaderboard examines how the leading it companies can use their influence to drive these changes  which in the 6th edition the sector shows slow but steady improvements in offering new solution that may achieve important progress  there are companies willing to make major investments to drive clean energy deployment and the number of companies that are increasing their commitment  betting for renewable energies  is also growing 
big companies such as google  wipro  sprint and softbank have prioritized changing the laws and policies that govern the energy system and incentivise investments in advanced energy efficiency technologies and renewable energy that will have a critical impact in many countries to determine a meaningful break in energy policies 
in the leaderboard we can find one main ranking with the overall scores and another three rankings for each one of the evaluated areas where we can find the top companies contributing in each 
ozone layer and greenfreeze  
the ozone layers surrounding the earth absorb significant amounts of ultraviolet radiation  a 1976 report by the us academy of sciences supported the ozone  depletion hypothesis   its suffering large losses from chlorinated and nitrogenous compounds was reported in 1985  earlier studies had led some countries to enact bans on aerosol sprays  so that the vienna convention was signed in 1985 the montreal protocol was signed in 1987 to go in force two years later 
the use of cfc s and hcfc s in refrigeration were and are among the banned technologies  a german technological institute developed an ozone-safe hydrocarbon alternative refrigerant which came to a greenpeace campaigner s attention in around 1992  the rights to the technology were donated to greenpeace  which maintained it as an open source patent  with industry resistance  greenpeace was able to rescue and engage a former east german manufacturer near closure  greenpeace s resourceful outreach and marketing resulted in the technologies rapid widespread production in germany  followed by the banning of cfc technology  they then succeeded in getting greenfreeze used in china and elsewhere in europe  and after some years in japan and south america  and finally in the us by 2012 
forest campaign  
greenpeace aims at protecting intact primary forests from
and degradation with the target of zero deforestation by 2020  greenpeace has accused several corporations  such as      
and
of having links to the deforestation of the   resulting in policy changes in several of the companies under criticism  greenpeace  together with other environmental   also campaigned for ten years for the eu to ban import of illegal timber  the eu decided to ban illegal timber on july 2010  as deforestation contributes to global warming  greenpeace has demanded that
 reduced emission from deforestation and forest degradation  should be included in the climate treaty following the  
another greenpeace movement concerning the rain forests is discouraging palm oil industries  the movement has been the most active in indonesia where already 6 million hectares are used for palm oil plantation and has plans for another 4 million hectares by 2015  acknowledging that mass production of palm oil may be disastrous on biodiversity of forests  greenpeace is actively campaigning against the production  urging the industries and the government to turn to other forms of energy resources  one of the positive results of the campaign was gar golden agri-resources   the world s second largest palm oil production company  deciding to commit itself to forest conservation  the company signed an agreement which prevents them from developing plantations in areas where large amounts of carbon are locked up 
removal of an ancient tree  
in june 1995  greenpeace took a trunk of a tree from the forests of the proposed
of koitajoki in   finland and put it on display at exhibitions held in austria and germany  greenpeace said in a press conference that the tree was originally from a logged area in the
which was supposed to be protected 
accused greenpeace of theft and said that the tree was from a normal forest and had been left standing because of its old age  metshallitus also said that the tree had actually crashed over a road during a storm  the incident received publicity in finland  for example in the large newspapers
and   greenpeace replied that the tree had fallen down because the protective forest around it had been   and that they wanted to highlight the fate of old forests in general  not the fate of one particular tree  greenpeace also highlighted that metshallitus admitted the value of the forest afterwards as metshallitus currently refers to koitajoki as a distinctive area because of its old growth forests 
tokyo two  
main article 
in 2008  two greenpeace anti-whaling activists  junichi sato and toru suzuki  stole a case of
from a delivery depot in aomori prefecture  japan  their intention was to expose what they considered embezzlement of the meat collected during whale hunts  after a brief investigation of their allegations was ended  sato and suzuki were arrested and charged with theft and trespass 
said that the arrests and following raids on greenpeace japan office and homes of five of greenpeace staff members were aimed at intimidating activists and non-governmental organizations  they were convicted of theft and trespass in september 2010 by the  
genetically modified organisms  gmos   
greenpeace has also supported the rejection of
from the us in famine-stricken zambia as long as supplies of non-genetically engineered grain exist  stating that the us  should follow in the european union s footsteps and allow aid recipients to choose their food aid  buying it locally if they wish  this practice can stimulate developing economies and creates more robust food security   adding that   if africans truly have no other alternative  the controversial ge maize should be milled so it can t be planted  it was this condition that allowed zambia s neighbours zimbabwe and malawi to accept it   after zambia banned all gm food aid  the former agricultural minister of zambia criticized   how the various international ngos that have spoken approvingly of the government s action will square the body count with their various consciences   concerning the decision of zambia  greenpeace has stated that   it was obvious to us that if no non-gm aid was being offered then they should absolutely accept gm food aid  but the zambian government decided to refuse the gm food  we offered our opinion to the zambian government and  as many governments do  they disregarded our advice  
greenpeace on golden rice  
greenpeace opposes the planned use of   a variety of
produced through
to
  a precursor of pro- in the edible parts of rice  the addition of beta-carotene to the rice is seen as preventative to loss of sight in poverty stricken countries where golden rice is intended for distribution  according to greenpeace  golden rice has not managed to do anything about malnutrition for 10 years during which alternative methods are already tackling malnutrition  the alternative proposed by greenpeace is to discourage
and to increase production of crops which are naturally nutrient-rich  containing other nutrients not found in golden rice in addition to beta-   greenpeace argues that resources should be spent on programs that are already working and helping to relieve malnutrition 
the renewal of these concerns coincided with the publication of a paper in the journal
about a version of golden rice with much higher levels of beta carotene  this  golden rice 2  was developed and patented by   which provoked greenpeace to renew its allegation that the project is driven by
and to serve as propaganda aimed at increasing public opinion of gmo products 
although greenpeace had stated that the true efficiency of the golden rice program in treating malnourished populations was its primary concern as early as 2001  statements from march and april 2005 also continued to express concern over human health and environmental safety  in particular  greenpeace has expressed concern over the lack of safety testing being done on gmo crops such as golden rice and of  playing with the lives of people   using golden rice to promote more gmos  
in june 2016  a conglomeration of 107 nobel laureates signed an open letter urging greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified crops and golden rice in particular  in the letter  they also called upon governments of the world to  do everything in their power to oppose greenpeace s actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology  especially seeds improved through biotechnology   the letter states that  opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped   greenpeace responded stating that  accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered  golden  rice are false  and that they support     investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet  rather than pouring money down the drain for ge  golden  rice  
toxic waste  
in july 2011  greenpeace released its dirty laundry report accusing some of the world s top fashion and
brands of releasing
into china s rivers  the report profiles the problem of
resulting from the release of toxic chemicals associated with the country s   investigations focused on
discharges from two facilities in china  one belonging to the
located on the
and the other to well dyeing factory ltd  located on a tributary of the   scientific analysis of samples from both facilities revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent
chemicals  including  
and  
the report goes on to assert that the youngor group and well dyeing factory ltd  - the two companies behind the facilities - have commercial relationships with a range of major clothing brands  including                      
and  
in 2013  greenpeace launched the  detox fashion  campaign  which signed up some fashion brands to stop the discharge of toxic chemicals into rivers as a result of the production of their clothes 
guide to greener electronics  
one important issue nowadays is the fact that everyone relies more in electronic gadgets to make their lives more productive and fun  but the rate we purchase and discard these products is having an important impact in our planet  in august 2006  greenpeace released the first edition of guide to greener electronics  a magazine where the companies were ranked for their green performance  mainly based in the use of toxics in their products and the e-waste 
the first edition of the magazine came up in august 2006 ranking the leading mobile and pc manufacturers  the criteria used reflected the demands of the toxic tech campaign where they demanded to the electronics companies to make products without toxic substances and take them back and recycle them once they are not going to be used any longer  in november 2011  the criteria were updated  as the industry had progressed since 2006  with the objective to get companies setting ambitious goals for greenhouse gas reduction  the use of renewable power up to 100 percent  producing long lasting products free of hazardous substances and increasing sustainable practices across the global electronics supply chain 
every three months  greenpeace released a new updated edition of the guide  the companies selected for every edition are determined by the latest industry sales figures of global market share for the past year in the electronics sector  mobile devices  pc and tv   the high rate of innovation in those industries makes them also highly competitive  therefore  by publicly comparing their performance  the guide encourage to make use of best practices to address the most important environmental challenges and also provides the costumer valuable information of the impact that the company has to their environment 
in order to ensure the transparency of the ranking the companies are assessed based only on their public information  for proving companies  policies and practices  greenpeace uses chemical testing of products  reports from industry observers  media reports and testing of consumer programs to check if they match with their actions  in case of contradiction of the company policy  are published and clearly explained the corresponding penalty points 
since the guide was released in 2006  along with other similar campaigns has driven numerous improvements  many of the companies ranked take the results very seriously and try to improve their performances such as eliminating toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling schemes 
the last published edition of guide to greener electronics was the 18th  in november 2012

in continuity of the successful campaign to reach the   in 2012 and 2013 protests with  save the arctic  banners were started  to stop oil- and gas-drilling  industrial fishing and military operations in the
region completely  a  global sanctuary in the high arctic  was demanded from the world leaders at the un general assembly   we want them to pass a un resolution expressing international concern for the arctic   a resolution to protect the very vulnerable wildlife and ecosystem  30 arctic sunrise activists were   19 september 2013  witnessing oil-drilling and protesting at the gazprom
by the   greenpeace members were originally charged with piracy  then later downgraded to hooliganism  before being dropped altogether following the passage of an amnesty law by the russian government 
in july 2014  greenpeace launched a global boycott campaign to persuade
to cease producing toys carrying the oil company shell s logo in response to shell s plans to drill for oil in the arctic  lego s partnership with shell dates back to the 1960s  although the lego company created a fictional oil company called   octan has appeared in countless sets  computer and console games  can be seen at
parks  and is featured as the corporation headed by the villain president business in  
in norway  
there is a conflict over oil rigs in the
between the
and greenpeace  in 2013  three activists of greenpeace got on a  s oil rig  wearing bear suits  according to a spokesman from greenpeace   they stayed on the rig for about three hours  the activists in bear suits  were escorted  to the shore 
reportedly did not intend to file a suit against them 
greenpeace had argued that statoil s drilling plans posed a threat to   an uninhabited wildlife sanctuary that is home to rare species including polar bears  because an oil spill would be nearly impossible to clean up in the arctic because of the harsh conditions  greenpeace regards the petroleum activities of statoil as  illegal   statoil denies the greenpeace statement  according to the maritime executive  2014   statoil says  statoil respects people s right to make a legal protest  and we feel it is important to have a democratic debate around the oil industry  we have established robust plans for the operation  and feel confident they can be carried out safely and without accidents  
on may 27  2014  greenpeace s ship    took over
  oil rig of
in the barents sea such that it became incapable of operating  after that  the manager of greenpeace norway
truls gulowsen answered a phone interview  stating that  five protesters left the rig by helicopter last night and three returned to a nearby greenpeace ship   there were seven more protesters on the rig at the time  but the norwegian police could not remove them immediately because the rig was a
ship registered in the marshall islands and thus regarded as a ship in the open sea  as long as it did not begin drilling  on may 29  however  the seven activists from greenpeace were peacefully captured by norwegian police on the rig  soon after  according to reuters  all the activists were set free without any fine  on may 30  the
finally towed away esperanza  though in the morning greenpeace submitted a plea on which more than 80,000 signatures to the norwegian environment minister
in oslo were written  norwegian government and police reportedly allowed the coast guard to tow the greenpeace ship 
the norwegian police stated that statoil asked greenpeace to stop preventing its activities  but greenpeace ignored the warning  the police have stated that greenpeace s interference with the petroleum activities of statoil was the contrary to norwegian law and ordered greenpeace to leave the barents sea site  statoil said delays to the start of drilling cost the company about  1.26 million per day 
according to reuters  statoil was slated to begin drilling  three oil wells in the apollo  atlantis and mercury prospects in the hoop area   which is  some 300 km away from the mainland  of norway   in the summer of 2014  greenpeace has continued to criticize the big oil company for their     arguing that statoil hid the truth that it is doing the risky oil drilling by holding    with lego and distracting people s attention to the company s project  and it also argues that statoil has to alter its attitude toward environments  norway s news in english 2014

criticism  
main article 
canadian ecologist   an early greenpeace member  left the organization in 1986 when it  according to moore  decided to support a universal ban on
in drinking water  moore has argued that greenpeace today is motivated by politics rather than science and that none of his  fellow directors had any formal science education   bruce cox  director of greenpeace canada  responded that greenpeace has never demanded a universal chlorine ban and that greenpeace does not oppose use of chlorine in drinking water or in pharmaceutical uses  adding that  mr  moore is alone in his recollection of a fight over chlorine and or use of science as his reason for leaving greenpeace     an early member of greenpeace has said that moore  uses his status as a so-called co-founder of greenpeace to give credibility to his accusations  i am also a co-founder of greenpeace and i have known patrick moore for 35 years       moore makes accusations that have no basis in fact   more recently moore has been particularly critical of greenpeace s stance on   an issue where moore has been joined by other environmentalists such as   claiming that greenpeace has  waged a campaign of misinformation  trashed the scientists who are working to bring golden rice to the people who need it  and supported the violent destruction of golden rice field trials  
also reversed his position on
in 1976  first opposing it and now supporting it  in australian newspaper   he writes  greenpeace is wrongwe must consider nuclear power   he argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on
or
emissions need increased use of nuclear energy    executive director of greenpeace us responded that nuclear energy is too risky  takes too long to build to address   and claims that most countries  including the u s   could shift to nearly 100 
while phasing out nuclear power by 2050 
a french journalist under the pen name olivier vermont wrote in his book la face cache de greenpeace   the hidden face of greenpeace   that he had joined greenpeace france and had worked there as a secretary  according to vermont he found misconduct  and continued to find it  from amsterdam to the international office  vermont said he found classified documents according to which half of the organization s 180 million revenue was used for the organization s salaries and structure  he also accused greenpeace of having unofficial agreements with polluting companies where the companies paid greenpeace to keep them from attacking the company s image  animal protection magazine animal people reported in march 1997 that greenpeace france and greenpeace international had sued olivier vermont and his publisher albin michel for issuing  defamatory statements  untruths  distortions of the facts and absurd allegations  
writing in   journalist
reacted to greenpeace s destruction of a genetically modified wheat crop in
as another sign that the organization has  lost its way  and had degenerated into a  sad  dogmatic  reactionary phalanx of anti-science zealots who care not for evidence  but for publicity  
press release blunder  
in philadelphia  in 2006  greenpeace issued a press release that said  in the twenty years since the
tragedy  the world s worst nuclear accident  there have been nearly  fill in alarmist and armageddonist factoid here    the final report warned of plane crashes and reactor meltdowns  according to a greenpeace spokesman  the memo was a joke that was accidentally released 
brent spar tanker  
research published in natural science journal
accused greenpeace of not caring for facts  when it criticized the dumping of the
tanker  and accused the group of exaggerating the volume of oil that was stored in the tanker  greenpeace had claimed that the tanker contained 5,500 tonnes of crude oil  while shell estimated it only contained 50 tonnes  in fact  the measurements had been made under duress during a protest occupation of the platform  since shell had refused permission  greenpeace was under attack by water cannons and the like  in fact  bbc issued an apology to greenpeace for having reported that the ngo lied 
shell uk took three years to evaluate disposal option and concluded that the disposal of the tanker in the deep ocean was the     bpeo   an option which gained some support within some portion of the scientific community  as it was found by some to be of  negligible  environmental impact  british government and oslo and paris commissions  ospar  accepted the solution 
the resulting ngo campaign against shell s proposals included letters  boycotts which even escalated to vandalism in germany  and lobbying at intergovernmental conferences  binding moratoriums supporting greenpeace s  ecosystem protection  and the precautionary principle position were issued in more than one intergovernmental meeting  and at the 1998 ospar convention  wwf presented a study of toxic effects on deep sea ecosystems  the meeting confirmed a general prohibition on ocean dumping  shell had transported the rig to the dumping site  but in the last hours canceled the operation and announced that it had failed in communicating its plans sufficiently to the public  admitting they had underestimated the strength of public opinion  in january  1998  shell issued a new bpeo indicating recycling the rig as a quay in norway 
in 1999  the
container was decommissioned and one side issue that emerged was that the legs of the structure were found to contain cold-water coral species  lophelia pertusa   as a result  the possibility was suggested of keeping the legs of such platforms on the sea bed in future  to serve as habitat  a greenpeace representative opposed the suggestion  citing the fact that the reefs formed by the coral are at risk  not the coral itself  and that such a move would not promote development of such reefs  and expose coral species to toxic substances found in oil 
pascal husting commute  
in 2013 reports noted that pascal husting  the director of greenpeace international s  international programme  was commuting 250 miles via plane  despite greenpeace s activism to reduce air travel due to carbon footprint  greenpeace has said  the growth in aviation is ruining our chances of stopping dangerous climate change   after a  public uproar  greenpeace announced that husting would commute via train in the future 
nazca lines  
in december 2014  greenpeace activists damaged rock related to the
in peru while setting up a banner within the lines of one of the famed geoglyphs  and there were concerns that the harm might be irreparable  the activists damaged an area around the hummingbird by walking near the glyph without regulation footwear  access to the area around the lines is strictly prohibited and special shoes must be worn to avoid damaging the
site  greenpeace claimed the activists were  absolutely careful to protect the nazca lines   but this is contradicted by video and photographs showing the activists wearing conventional shoes  not special protective shoes  while walking on the site  greenpeace has apologized to the peruvian people  but loise jamie castillo  peru s vice minister of cultural heritage called the apology  a joke   because greenpeace refused to identify the vandals or accept responsibility  culture minister diana lvarez-caldern said that evidence gathered during an investigation by the government will be used as part of a legal suit against greenpeace   the damage done is irreparable and the apologies offered by the environmental group aren t enough   she said at a news conference 
by january  2015  greenpeace had presented statements of the four members of the ngo involved in the action 
anti whaling campaign in norway in the 1990s  
during the 1990s greenpeace conducted many anti-whaling expeditions in norway  the criticism was that greenpeace only campaigned against whales to gain economic donations from the us economy  and it had little to do with saving the environment  for example  shark hunting is a much bigger problem for the environment  but since sharks are hated they re not a big money maker in the us  greenpeace have always rejected this claim  however  in norwegian newspaper dagbladet on 11 april 2015
admitted that the anti-whale campaign was a  miscalculation   greenpeace holds that whaling was only resumed by norway after the iwc ban because of political election motives  and faces many explicit hurdles  including decreased demand in japan and toxic chemical contamination 
open letter from nobel laureates  
in june 2016  107 nobel laureates signed an open letter urging greenpeace to end its opposition to genetically modified organisms  gmos   the letter stated   we urge greenpeace and its supporters to re-examine the experience of farmers and consumers worldwide with crops and foods improved through biotechnology  recognize the findings of authoritative scientific bodies and regulatory agencies  and abandon their campaign against  gmos  in general and golden rice in particular  scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as  if not safer than those derived from any other method of production  there has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from their consumption  their environmental impacts have been shown repeatedly to be less damaging to the environment  and a boon to global biodiversity   the nobel laureates also called upon governments of the world to  do everything in their power to oppose greenpeace s actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology  especially seeds improved through biotechnology   the letter goes on to say that  opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped   greenpeace responded stating that  accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered  golden  rice are false  and that they support     investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet  rather than pouring money down the drain for ge  golden  rice  
the nobel laureate letter has been itself subject to scrutiny  since the claims are unfounded   golden rice  has not even been successfully brought to market  or even patented in the country where it is being tested  as such  no anti-gmo protesters have played any role in the gmo product s so far unsuccessful development  moreover  the letter itself is structured in such a way that it uses many adjectives and extreme accusations without any substantiating references  it has been described as more similar to a work of biotech industry propaganda than a product of nobel scientists
