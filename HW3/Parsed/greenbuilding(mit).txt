green building   
the cecil and ida green building  also called the green building or building 54  is an academic and research building at the       it was designed by
and   pei  among the world s most noted architects  had received his bachelor s degree from mit in 1940  principal donor
received a bachelor s degree and master s degree from mit and was a co-founder of

architecture  
the green building was constructed during 1962-1964  in   it has 18 floors  equivalent to 21 stories or 295 feet  90m  tall  with a concrete facade that more or less matches the
and concrete of the older mit buildings near it  the basement of the building is below    and connects to the mit
system  three
operate in the green building  there are
at both the east and west sides  whose exterior facades present a vast windowless expanse relieved only by one-story tall concrete recessed panels  on the  ll  level  actually one story above ground level   is room 54-100  a large   the second floor formerly housed the lindgren library  part of mit s library system  but this separate facility was consolidated into another library in 2009 
the green building is the tallest building in   when it was built  there was a limit on the number of floors    thus  it was designed to be on stilts  with the first occupied floor approximately 30 feet above grade in order to  circumvent  this law    the footprint of every floor measures only 60 by 120 feet  18 by 36m   which research groups quickly outgrew  forcing some of them to disperse elsewhere on campus 
the tower s height has some functional purpose  since its roof supports
and radio communications equipment  plus a white spherical
enclosing long-distance
apparatus  this technical equipment all requires a
vantage point for optimum range and accuracy  and would have required construction of some kind of tower to function as intended  to minimize interference with radio signals  other buildings on mit s
are less than half the height of the green building  and the dormitory towers of eastgate  westgate  and macgregor house are at least 1500feet  450m  away 
occupancy  
the green building is the main facility of the department of earth  atmospheric  and planetary science  eaps   also known as course 12  the departmental headquarters is on the 9th floor of the building  the lower floors of the building contain the
section  the middle floors have the
section      and    the upper floors house the
section  which also includes
and   
problems  
when the green building was first opened  the isolated prominence of the building and its relative proximity to the
basin increased wind speeds in the high open archway at its base  preventing people from entering or leaving the building through the hinged main doors on windy days  necessitating use of a tunnel connecting to the other buildings  large wood panels were temporarily erected in the open concourse to block the wind  and
were later installed at the ground floor entries to amend this problem somewhat  several windows cracked  and at least one large pane popped out on upper stories  at least in part due to the effects of wind  eventually requiring all the windows to be replaced  a few years later  a similar-appearing problem was repeated in boston s
located in
across the river  a 60-story skyscraper which happened to be designed by the same architectural firm 
it is incorrectly rumored that  s monumental sculpture the big sail  was situated in front of the building to deflect the high winds  the sculpture is located too far from the building entryway to have much effect on wind velocities there 
hacks  
because of its height and visibility from the boston
neighborhood across the
basin  plus its rectangular grid of large 6-by-8-foot  1.8m 2.4m  upright rectangular single-pane windows forming a crude 9 x 18   the green building has been the site of many
or pranks  in 1993  one widely viewed hack repurposed the nine top-floor windows as an enormous digital
for the traditional
concert of the
orchestra  several other simpler hacks have used the entire window array for stationary displays  this practice is sufficiently commonplace to have acquired the term greenspeak  which should not be confused with the famously obscure
pronouncements of former
chairman   
in september 2011  hackers installed 153    9 x 17  custom-made wirelessly controlled color-changing high-power
lights into every window above the first floor  they displayed a waving
throughout the evening of september 11  2011 in remembrance of the
of 2001  for a short time in the early morning of september 12  the lights displayed a
game  thus realizing a long-standing hack proposal  the    of hacks  the display hardware had occasional glitches  and was removed as of september 13  the hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability  on april 20  2012  mit hackers successfully turned the green building into a huge  playable tetris game  operated from a wireless control podium at a comfortable viewing distance in front of the building  visitors to campus preview weekend  a gathering for admitted prospective freshman students  were invited to play the game on the colossal 80-by-250-foot  24m 76m  display grid  which was claimed to be the second-largest full-color video display in the us 
instead of a one-shot temporary installation  the hackers have designed and built a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the mit community  an understanding has been reached with the department of earth  atmospheric and planetary sciences  eaps   which is headquartered in the green building  to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window  to avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to  opt out   each light display is equipped with a
button  which will disable the
lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed  in addition  the hackers have released
software tools used to develop new display patterns  so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images  in cooperation with the hacker engineers 
on the night after the
of april 15  2013  the green building lighting displayed an american flag pattern  after the shooting death of
by the alleged bombers a few days later  a 250 foot  76m  black ribbon pattern was displayed in his memory 
as a prototype feasibility demonstration  the
 located in building n52  had years earlier added a scale model of the green building to its
layout  passersby inside building n52 can view the model building and railway layout through a large window and play a monochromatic version of tetris via remote control  accompanied by authentic-sounding music  even when the facility is closed 
other hacks utilize the height of the building  such as a 1974 failed attempt to operate a giant
from the roof of the tower  launching of projectiles from the roof is strongly discouraged  due to the unpredictable high wind gusts  posing a serious danger to passersby  and residents of nearby
dormitory 
pumpkin drop  
at midnight on the last saturday of october  1west  the smallest hall in the east campus dorm  drops a large number of pumpkins  up to the low hundreds  off the roof of the green building  students come to watch  but the area around the foot of the building is quarantined off  to prevent anyone from being hit 
art  
the green building faces mcdermott court  also known as the dot   this grassy area is flanked by the 33-ton metal sculpture la grande voile  the big sail   one of  s  stabile  artworks 
in may 2011  a temporary artwork was installed in the arched  breezeway  at the base of the green building  to take advantage of its legendary wind gusts  designed by meejin yoon  an associate professor of architecture  wind screen was an array of wind-driven
generators that would light up whenever there was enough air movement  this installation was featured in the fast  festival of art  science  and technology  celebration  part of the mit 150 commemoration of mit s 150th anniversary 
on may 18th  2013  a night-time projection on the
on the rooftop of the green building by artist
beamed the image of bengali polymath and biophysicist
during a
on plant signaling and behavior
