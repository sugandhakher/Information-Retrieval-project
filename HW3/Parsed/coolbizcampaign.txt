the cool biz campaign is a japanese campaign initiated by the japanese
from summer 2005 as a means to help reduce japanese electricity consumption by limiting the use of air conditioning  this was enabled by changing the standard office air conditioner temperature to 28c  or about 82f  and introducing a liberal summer dress code in the bureaucracy of the japanese government so staff could work in the warmer temperature  the campaign then spread to the private sector 
this idea was proposed by the then-
under the cabinet of prime minister   initially the campaign was from june to september  but from 2011  when there were electricity shortages after the
it was lengthened  it now runs from may to october

plan  
according to the ministry of the environment  central government ministries were to set
temperatures at 28c until september  the cool biz dress code advises workers to starch collars so they stand up and to wear trousers made from materials that breathe and absorb moisture  additionally  workers are encouraged to wear short-sleeved shirts without jackets or ties  many workers  though  were confused about whether they should follow the new stipulationsmany came to work with their jackets in hand and their ties in their pockets  even those who liked the idea of dressing more casually sometimes became self-conscious during their commutes when they were surrounded by non-government employees who were all wearing standard business suits  many government workers said they felt it was impolite not to wear a tie when meeting counterparts from the private sector 
all of the government leaders took part in cool biz  prime minister koizumi was frequently interviewed without a tie or jacket  and this produced a significantly raised profile of the campaign 
result of cool biz campaign  
on october 28  2005  the moe announced results of the cool biz campaign  the moe conducted a web-based questionnaire survey on the cool biz campaign on september 30  2005  covering some 1,200 men and women randomly extracted from an internet panel recruited by a research company  survey results indicate that 95.8  of respondents knew cool biz  and 32.7  of 562 respondents answered that their offices set the air conditioner thermostat higher than in previous years  based on these figures  the ministry estimated that the campaign resulted in a 460,000-ton reduction in co2 emission  the equivalent volume of co2 emitted by about 1 million households for one month 
some companies including
request their employees not to wear jackets and ties even when meeting with business partners 
the results for 2006 were even better  resulting in an estimated 1.14 million-ton reduction in co2 emission  the equivalent to the co2 emissions by about 2.5 million households for one month  the ministry also stated that it intends to continue encouraging people to set summer office temperatures at no lower than 28c as well as to work to have the cool biz concept take permanent root in society 
on july 2009  the cabinet office announced results of a new questionnaire survey  which indicates that 91.8  of respondents knew cool biz campaign  and 57  of them put the campaign into practice 
economic results  
while cool biz spread energy savings to all businesses  the necktie business suffered  they claim that summer sales have dropped 36  since 2005  and asked the environment minister to end the campaign 
on the other hand  the ministry of economy  trade and industry  meti  analyzed that the cool biz campaign increases replacement demand for clothing and generates positive macroeconomic effects on the
by 18 billion yen on summer 2005 
announced that the total economic effect was more than 100 billion yen in 2005 
warm biz  
during winter 2005  there was talk on many of the major news networks of promoting a  warm biz  style for winter  suggesting that people wear waistcoats  knit sweaters  and lap blankets  warm biz was not endorsed by the japanese government at first  the food industry eagerly promoted this campaign by selling foods that warm people up  such as  
however  the electric utility industry had little enthusiasm for the campaign  since fossil fuel heating is popular in northern part of japan  warm biz had little effect on electric consumption  thus  warm biz is more often referred in an environmental conservation context since fossil fuel heating releases more carbon dioxide than air conditioners do 
super cool biz  
following the
in march 2011  the shutdown of many nuclear power plants for safety reasons led to energy shortages  to conserve energy  the government recommended setting air conditioners at 28 degrees celsius  switching off computers not in use  and called for shifting work hours to the morning and taking more summer vacation than usual  the government then launched a  super cool biz  campaign to encourage workers to wear outfits appropriate for the office yet cool enough to endure the summer heat  polo shirts and trainers are allowed  while jeans and sandals are also acceptable under certain circumstances  june 1 marked the start of the ministry of the environment s super cool biz campaign  with  full-page newspaper ads and photos of ministry workers smiling rather self-consciously at their desks wearing polo shirts and colorful okinawa kariyushi shirts   the campaign was repeated in 2012
