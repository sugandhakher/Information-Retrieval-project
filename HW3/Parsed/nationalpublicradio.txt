funding  
in 2010  npr revenues totaled  180 million  with the bulk of revenues coming from programming fees 
from
or business entities  contributions and   according to the 2009 financial statement  about 50  of npr revenues come from the fees it charges member stations for programming and distribution charges  typically  npr member stations receive funds through on-air   corporate underwriting  state and local governments  educational institutions  and the federally funded corporation for public broadcasting  cpb   in 2009  member stations derived 6  of their revenue from federal  state and local government funding  10  of their revenue from
grants  and 14  of their revenue from universities  while npr does not receive any direct federal funding  it does receive a small number of competitive grants from cpb and federal agencies like the department of education and the department of commerce  this funding amounts to approximately 2  of npr s overall revenues 
during the 1970s and early 1980s  the majority of npr funding came from the federal government  steps were taken during the 1980s to completely wean npr from government support  but
forced the network to make immediate changes  according to   in 2009 11.3  of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources  principally through cpb  in 2012 10.9  of the revenues for public radio came from federal sources 
in 2011  npr announced the roll-out of their own online   which allows member stations to run geographically
spots from national sponsors that may otherwise be unavailable to their local area  opening additional revenue streams to the broadcaster 
2013 saw the launch of center stage  a mix of
and
featured prominently on the npr homepage  above-the-fold  the launch partner for center stage was  
in 2014  npr ceo jarl mohn said the network would begin to increase revenue by having brands npr views as more relevant to the audience underwrite npr programs and requesting higher rates from them 
underwriting spots vs  commercials  
in contrast with   npr s radio broadcasts do not carry traditional commercials  but has advertising in the form of brief statements from major sponsors which may include corporate   descriptions of products and services  contact information such as website addresses and   these statements are called
and  unlike commercials  are governed by specific fcc restrictions in addition to
laws  they cannot advocate a product or  promote the goods and services  of for-profit entities  these restrictions apply only to radio broadcasts and not npr s other digital platforms  when questioned on the subject of how corporate underwriting revenues and foundation grants were holding up during the recession  in a speech broadcast on
before the
on march 2  2009  then president and ceo
stated   underwriting is down  it s down for everybody  this is the area that is most down for us  in sponsorship  underwriting  advertising  call it whatever you want  just like it is for all of media   hosts of the npr program
stated the audience is indeed a product being sold to advertisers in the same way as commercial stations  saying   they are not advertisers exactly but  they have a lot of the same characteristics  let s just say that  
audience  
a harris telephone survey conducted in 2005 found that npr was the most trusted news source in the united states 
according to 2009  npr statistics  about 20.9 million listeners tune into npr each week  according to 2015 figures  87  of the npr terrestrial public radio audience and 67  of the npr podcast audience is white  according to the 2012
2012 news consumption survey  npr listeners tend to be highly educated  with 54  of regular listeners being college graduates and 21  having some college  npr s audience is almost exactly average in terms of the sex of listeners  49  male  51  female   npr listeners have higher incomes than average  the 2012 pew study showed that 43  earn over  75,000  27  earn between  30,000 and  75,000   the pew survey found that the npr audience tends democratic  17  republican  37  independent  43  democratic  and liberal  21  conservative  39  moderate  36  liberal  
npr stations generally do not subscribe to the
rating service and are not included in published ratings and rankings such as   however  npr station listenership is measured by arbitron in both diary and ppm  people meter  markets  npr stations are frequently not included in  summary level  diary data used by most advertising agencies for media planning  data on npr listening can be accessed using  respondent level  diary data  additionally  all radio stations  public and commercial  are treated equally within the ppm data sets making npr station listenership data much more widely available to the media planning community  according to arbitron s national broadcast audience estimate report for september 29  2011  npr s signature morning news program  morning edition  is the network s most popular program  drawing 12.9 million listeners a week  with its afternoon newsmagazine  all things considered  a close second  with 12.2 million listeners a week  arbitron data is also provided by   a non-profit corporation which subscribes to the arbitron service and distributes the data to npr and other non-commercial stations and on its website 
digital media  
npr s history in
includes the work of an independent  for-profit company called public interactive  which was founded in 1999 and acquired by
in june 2004  when it became a non-profit company  by july 2008  public interactive had  170 subscribers who collectively operate 325 public radio and television stations  and clients such as     and   by the end of that month  npr acquired public interactive from pri in march 2011  npr revealed a restructuring proposal in which boston-based public interactive would become npr digital services  separate from the washington d c -based npr digital media  which focuses on npr-branded services  npr digital services would continue offering its services to public tv stations 
the technical backbone of its digital news publishing system is   which was built on   an open-source  
kinsey wilson and the npr org crew at the 69th annual peabody awards
npr has been dubbed as  leveraging the twitter generation     because of its adaptation of the popular
service as one of its primary vehicles of information  of npr s twitter followers  the majority  67   still do listen to npr on the radio  according to   in a survey of more than 10,000 respondents  npr found that its
followers are younger  more connected to the   and more likely to access content through digital platforms such as its -winning website npr org  as well as  
and more    npr has more than one twitter account including  npr  its survey found that most respondents followed between two and five npr accounts  including topical account  show-specific accounts and on-air staff accounts    in addition  npr s
page has been at the forefront of the company foray into social media  started by college student and fan geoff campbell in 2008  the page was quickly taken over by the organization  and over the last two years has grown to nearly 4 million fans and is a popular example of the company s new focus on a younger audience

controversies  
main article 
over the course of npr s history  controversies have arisen over several incidents and topics 
allegations of ideological bias  
npr has been accused of displaying both liberal bias  as alleged in work such as a
and
study of morning edition  and conservative bias  including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative   npr has also been accused of bias related to specific topics  including support of the
and coverage of   the npr ombudsman has described how npr s coverage of the israel-palestinian conflict has been simultaneously criticized as biased by both sides  university of texas journalism professor and author
has criticized npr as taking a pro-war stance during coverage of iraq war protests 
in 2002 and 2003  surveys and follow-up focus groups conducted by the tarrance group and lake snell perry   associates have indicated that   the majority of the u s  adult population does not believe that the news and information programming on public broadcasting is biased  the plurality of americans indicate that there is no apparent bias one way or the other  while approximately two-in-ten detect a liberal bias and approximately one-in-ten detect a conservative bias  
euphemisms  
in a controversial act  npr banned in 2009 the use of the word  torture  in the context of the bush administration s use of   npr s ombudswoman  s defense of the policy was that  calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides   but
professor of linguistics 
pointed out that virtually all media around the world  other than what he called the  spineless u s  media   call these techniques torture  in an article which criticized npr and other u s  media for their use of euphemisms for torture 
discussed what he called the enabling  corruption of american journalism  
this active media complicity in concealing that our government created a systematic torture regime  by refusing ever to say so  is one of the principal reasons it was allowed to happen for so long  the steadfast  ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the bush administration did as  torture  even in the face of more than 100 detainee deaths  the use of that term by a leading bush official to describe what was done at guantanamo  and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word  torture  to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries --reveals much about how the modern journalist thinks 
live from death row commentaries  
in 1994  npr arranged to air  on all things considered  a series of three-minute commentaries by   a journalist convicted in a controversial trial of murdering a
officer  they cancelled airing them after the
and members of the u s  congress objected 
juan williams comments  
on october 20  2010  npr terminated senior news analyst  s independent contract over a series of incidents culminating in remarks he made on the
regarding muslims 
ronald schiller comments  
in march 2011  conservative political activist and provocateur
sent partners simon templar  a   and shaughn adeleye to secretly record their discussion with   npr s outgoing senior vice president for   and an associate  in which schiller made remarks viewed as disparaging of  the current republican party  especially the    and controversial comments regarding palestine and funding for npr  npr disavowed schiller s comments  ceo vivian schiller  who is not related to ronald  later resigned over the fallout from the comments and the previous firing of juan williams
