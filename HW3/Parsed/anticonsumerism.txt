that is opposed to   the continual buying and consuming of material possessions  anti-consumerism is concerned with the private actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals at the expense of the public welfare  especially in matters of environmental protection    and
in the governing of a society  in politics  anti-consumerism overlaps with     and
activism  moreover  a conceptual variation of anti-consumerism is   living in a material way that transcends consumerism 
anti-consumerism arose in response to the problems caused by the long-term mistreatment of human consumers and of the animals consumed  and from the incorporation of
to school   examples of anti-consumerism are the book
 2000  by   and documentary films such as
 2003   by mark achbar and jennifer abbott  and
 2003   by erik gandini  each made
popular as an ideologically accessible form of civil and political action 
the criticism of
as a dehumanizing behaviour that is destructive of the earth  as   comes from
and   the religious criticism asserts that materialist consumerism interferes with the connection between the individual man and woman and god  and so is an inherently
style of life  thus the german historian

background  
anti-consumerism originated from criticism of consumption  starting with   who  in the book
 1899   indicated that
dates from the   the term consumerism also denotes economic policies associated with   and the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society   cf

many
believe the rise of large-business corporations poses a threat to the legitimate authority of
and the public sphere    they feel corporations are invading people s   manipulating politics and governments  and creating false needs in consumers  they state evidence such as invasive advertising       child-targeted advertising  aggressive   massive corporate campaign contributions in political elections  interference in the policies of sovereign nation states     and news stories about
   for example    
anti-consumerism protesters point out that the main responsibility of a corporation is to answer only to   giving
and other issues almost no consideration    the management does have a primary responsibility to their shareholders  since any
activities that do not directly serve the business could be deemed to be a   this sort of financial responsibility means that multi-national corporations will pursue strategies to intensify labor and reduce costs  for example  they will attempt to find low wage economies with laws which are conveniently lenient on human rights  the  
organization and so on  see  for example    
an important contribution to the critique of consumerism has been made by french philosopher   arguing modern capitalism is governed by consumption rather than production  and the advertising techniques used to create
amount to the destruction of psychic and collective   the diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products  he argues  results in an addictive cycle of consumption  leading to hyper consumption  the exhaustion of desire  and the reign of symbolic misery 
conspicuous consumption  
main article 
it is preoccupation with possessions  more than anything else  that prevents us from living freely and nobly 

trying to reduce environmental pollution without reducing consumerism is like combating drug trafficking without reducing the drug addiction 

in many critical contexts    the term describes the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume  especially with commercial
names and obvious
appeal  such as a brand of expensive automobiles or   it is a pejorative term which most people deny  having some more specific excuse or
for consumption other than the idea that they are  compelled to consume   a culture that has a high amount of consumerism is referred to as a  
to those who embrace the idea of consumerism  these products are not seen as valuable in themselves  but rather as social signals that allow them to identify like-minded people through consumption and display of similar products  few would yet go so far  though  as to admit that their relationships with a product or brand name could be substitutes for healthy human relationships that sometimes lack in a dysfunctional modern  
the older term conspicuous consumption described the
in the 1960s  but was soon linked to larger debates about     and its corollary

the term and concept of conspicuous consumption originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writing of economist   the term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour  veblen s scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following 
it is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption  that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption  so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence  in an inclement climate  for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed 
in 1955  economist
stated  as quoted by   2009  
 our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life  that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals  that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption  we need things consumed  burned up  worn out  replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate  
according to archaeologists  evidence of conspicuous consumption up to several millennia ago has been found  suggesting that such behavior is inherent to humans 
consumerism and advertising  
anti-consumerists believe
plays a huge role in human life by informing values and assumptions of the cultural system  deeming what is acceptable and determining social standards  they declare that ads create a hyper-real world where commodities appear as the key to securing happiness  anti-consumerists cite studies that find that individuals believe their quality of life improves in relation to social values that lie outside the capability of the market place  therefore  advertising attempts to equate the social with the material by utilizing images and slogans to link commodities with the real sources of human happiness  such as meaningful relationships  ads are then a detriment to society because they tell consumers that accumulating more and more possessions will bring them closer to self-actualization  or the concept of a complete and secure being   the underlying message is that owning these products will enhance our image and ensure our popularity with others   and while advertising promises that a product will make the consumer happy  advertising simultaneously depends upon the consumer never being truly happy  as then the consumer would no longer feel the need to consume needless products 
anti-consumerists claim that in a consumerist society  advertisement images disempower and objectify the consumer  by stressing individual power  choice and desire  advertising falsely implies the control lies with the consumer  because anti-consumerists believe commodities only supply short-term gratification  they detract from a sustainably happy society  further  advertisers have resorted to new techniques of capturing attention  such as the increased speed of ads and   in this way  commercials infiltrate the consumerist society and become an inextricable part of culture  anti-consumerists condemn advertising because it constructs a simulated world that offers fantastical
to consumers  rather than reflecting actual reality  they further argue that ads depict the interests and lifestyles of the elite as natural  cultivating a deep sense of inadequacy among viewers  they denounce use of beautiful models because they glamorize the commodity beyond reach of the average individual 
in an opinion segment of
magazine published in august 2009  reporter andy coghlan cited
of the
and
of the   saying that human beings  despite considering themselves civilized thinkers  are  subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival  domination and expansion    an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything  and  given time  will redress all the world s existing inequalities   according to figures presented by rees at the annual meeting of the   human society is in a  global overshoot   consuming 30  more material than is sustainable from the world s resources  rees went on to state that at present  85 countries are exceeding their domestic  bio-capacities   and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries 
alternatives to mainstream economic concepts  
this section may be
to readers   august 2013    
such anti consumerist  anti capitalist notions are not without their detractors  new thought and theory has spurred movements to alter world economic climate  green movements and some other thinkers are opposed to the focus put on economics  the need for terminology has created familiar ideas such as   and  
  an early economist  had ideas that state the finitude of growth  rather than the opposite  his ideas were similar to those of   when he said  buy land  they don t make it anymore   to ricardian logic  land was a limiting factor

and popular writer  referred to anti-consumerism arguments as  marxism lite
