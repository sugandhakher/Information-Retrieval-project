history
the site of the empire state building was first developed as the john thompson farm in the late 18th century  at the time  a stream ran across the site  emptying into sunfish pond  located a block away  beginning in the late 19th century  the block was occupied by the   frequented by   the social elite of new york 
the limestone for the empire state building came from the empire mill in sanders  indiana which is an unincorporated town adjacent to bloomington  indiana  the empire mill land office is near state road 37 and old state road 37 just south of bloomington  the bloomington  bedford  and oolitic area is known locally as the limestone capital of the world 
design and construction
a worker bolts beams during construction  the
can be seen in the background 
the empire state building was designed by
from the architectural firm   which produced the building drawings in just two weeks  using its earlier designs for the
in   north carolina  and the
in   ohio  designed by the architectural firm   as a basis  every year the staff of the empire state building sends a father s day card to the staff at the reynolds building in winston-salem to pay homage to its role as predecessor to the empire state building  the building was designed from the top down  the general contractors were the starrett brothers and eken  and the project was financed primarily by
and   the construction company was chaired by   a former
and  s general builders supply corporation supplied the building materials 
was project construction superintendent 
excavation of the site began on january 22  1930  and construction on the building itself started on march 17st  patrick s dayper al smith s influence as empire state  inc  president  the project involved 3,400 workers  mostly immigrants from europe  along with hundreds of
iron workers  many from the
reserve near   according to official accounts  five workers died during the construction  governor smith s grandchildren cut the ribbon on may 1  1931  lewis wickes hine s photography of the construction provides not only invaluable documentation of the construction  but also a glimpse into common day life of workers in that era 
the construction was part of an intense competition in new york for the title of     two other projects fighting for the title 
and the   were still under construction when work began on the empire state building  each held the title for less than a year  as the empire state building surpassed them upon its completion  on april 11  1931  12 days ahead of schedule  just 410days after construction commenced  the building was officially opened on may 1  1931 in dramatic fashion  when united states president
turned on the building s lights with the push of a button from washington  d c  ironically  the first use of tower lights atop the empire state building  the following year  was for the purpose of signaling the victory of
over hoover in the presidential election of november 1932 
opening
view of the building from the north
the building s opening coincided with the
in the united states  and as a result much of its office space was initially unrented  the building s vacancy was exacerbated by its poor location on 34th street  which placed it relatively far from public transportation  as
and   built decades beforehand  are several blocks away  as is the more recently built   other more successful skyscrapers  such as the   did not have this problem  in its first year of operation  the observation deck took in approximately 2million dollars  as much money as its owners made in rent that year  the lack of renters led new yorkers to deride the building as the  empty state building   the building only became profitable in 1950  the 1951 sale of the empire state building to
and his business partners was brokered by the prominent upper manhattan real-estate firm charles f  noyes   company for a record  51million  at the time  that was the highest price paid for a single structure in real-estate history

bomber  piloted in thick fog by
william franklin smith  jr   crashed into the north side of the empire state building  between the 79th and 80th floors  where the offices of the
were located  one engine shot through the side opposite the impact and flew as far as the next block  where it landed on the roof of a nearby building  starting a fire that destroyed a penthouse  the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft  the resulting fire was extinguished in 40minutes  fourteen people were killed in the incident  elevator operator betty lou oliver survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator  which still stands as the
for the longest survived elevator fall recorded  despite the damage and loss of life  the building was open for business on many floors on the following monday  the crash helped spur the passage of the long-pending
of 1946  as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law  allowing people to sue the government for the incident 
a year later  another aircraft narrowly missed striking the building 
suicide attempts
over the years  more than 30 people have   most successfully  by jumping from the upper parts of the building  the first suicide occurred even before its completion  by a worker who had been laid off  the fence around the observatory terrace was put up in 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span 
on december 16  1943  ex-
william lloyd rambo  22  jumped to his death from the 86th floor  landing amidst christmas shoppers on the street below  in the early morning of september 27  1946

the empire state building was the first building to have more than 100 floors  it has 6,500 windows and 73 elevators  and there are 1,860 steps from street level to the 102nd floor  it has a total floor area of 2,768,591sqft  257,211m2   the base of the empire state building is about 2 acres  8,094m2   the building houses 1,000 businesses and has its own zip code  10118  as of 2007  approximately 21,000 employees work in the building each day  making the empire state building the second-largest single office complex in america  after   the building was completed in one year and 45days  its original 64 elevators are located in a central core  today  the empire state building has 73 elevators in all  including service elevators  it takes less than one minute by elevator to get to the 80th floor  which contains a gift shop and an exhibit detailing the building s construction  from there  visitors can take another elevator or climb the stairs to the 86th floor  where an outdoor observation deck is located  the building has 70mi  113km  of pipe  2,500,000ft  760,000m  of electrical wire  and about 9,000 faucets    it is heated by low-pressure steam  despite its height  the building only requires between 2 and 3psi  14 and 21kpa  of steam pressure for heating  it weighs approximately 370,000 short tons  340,000t   the exterior of the building is clad in
panels 
the empire state building cost  40,948,900 to build  equivalent to  638,247,300 in 2016   long-term forecasting of the life cycle of the structure was implemented at the design phase to ensure that the building s future intended uses were not restricted by the requirements of previous generations  this is particularly evident in the over-design of the building s electrical system 
the building s
design is typical of preworld war ii architecture in new york  the modernistic
canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th streets lead to two story-high corridors around the elevator core  crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level  the elevator core contains 67 elevators 
the lobby is three stories high and features an aluminum relief of the skyscraper without the antenna  which was not added to the spire until 1952  the north corridor contained eight illuminated panels  created by roy sparkia and rene nemorov in 1963 in time for the   which depicts the building as the   alongside the traditional seven  these panels were eventually moved near a ticketing line for the observation deck 
until the 1960s  the ceilings in the lobby had a shiny art deco mural inspired by both the sky and the   until it was covered with ceiling tiles and fluorescent lighting  because the original murals  designed by an artist named leif neandross  were damaged  reproductions were installed  over 50 artists and workers used 15,000 square feet of aluminum and 1,300 square feet of 23-carat gold leaf to re-create the mural  renovations to the lobby alluded to original plans for the building  replacing the clock over the information desk in the fifth avenue lobby with an   as well as installing two chandeliers originally intended to be part of the building when it first opened  in 2000  the building s owners installed a series of paintings by the new york artist
in the concourse level  in january 2014 the artist filed suit in federal court in new york under the   alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist 
the building s lobbies and common areas received a  550 million renovation in 2009  which included new air conditioning  waterproofing  and renovating the observation deck  moving the gift shop to the 80th floor  of this   120million was spent in an effort to transform the building into a more
and eco-friendly structure  for example  the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into
which block heat but pass light 
operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved  17 million of the project s capital cost immediately  partly funding other retrofitting  receiving a gold
rating in september 2011  the empire state building is the tallest leed certified building in the united states 
lighting at the top of the empire state building
features
above the 102nd floor
on the 102nd floor of the empire state building there is a door with stairs ascending to the 103rd floor  this was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to the building s spire  and has a circular balcony outside  it is now a hot spot for celebrities    and an access point to reach the spire for maintenance  the room now contains electrical equipment  above the 103rd floor  there is a set of stairs and a ladder to reach the spire for maintenance work 
the building s
spire was designed to be a mooring mast and depot for   an elevator between the 86th and 102nd floors would carry passengers after they checked in on the 86th floor  the idea proved impractical and dangerous  due to the powerful updrafts caused by the building itself  as well as the lack of mooring lines tying the other end of the craft to the ground  the building s design was expanded to include the mooring mast as part of a competition for the world s tallest building   
a large broadcast tower was added atop the spire in the early 1950s  to support the transmission antennas of several television and fm stations  until then  nbc had exclusive rights to the site  and  beginning in 1931  built various  smaller antennas for their television transmissions 
broadcast stations
new york city is the largest media market in the united states  since the september 11 attacks  nearly all of the city s commercial broadcast stations  both television and fm radio  have transmitted from the top of the empire state building  although a few fm stations are located at the nearby   most new york city
broadcast from sites across the
in
or from other surrounding areas 
antennae for broadcast stations are located at the top of the empire state building 
broadcasting began at the empire state building on december 22  1931  when
began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire  they leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there  andin 1934rca was joined by
in a cooperative venture to test his fm system from the building s antenna  when armstrong and rca fell out in 1935 and his fm equipment was removed  the 85th floor became the home of rca s new york television operations  first as experimental station w2xbs channel 1  which eventually became  on july 1  1941  commercial station wnbt  channel 1  now
channel 4   nbc s fm station  weaf-fm  now wqht  began transmitting from the antenna in 1940  nbc retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950  when the
ordered the exclusive deal broken  based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the  now  seven new york-area television stations  five licensed to new york city  ny  one licensed to newark  nj  and one licensed to secaucus  nj  to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted  construction on a giant tower began  other television broadcasters then joined rca at the building  on the 83rd  82nd  and 81st floors  frequently bringing sister fm stations along for the ride  multiple transmissions of tv and fm began from the new tower in 1951  in 1965  a separate set of fm antennas was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna  when the world trade center was being constructed  it caused serious reception problems for the television stations  most of which then moved to the world trade center as soon as it was completed  this made it possible to renovate the antenna structure and the transmitter facilities for the benefit of the fm stations remaining there  which were soon joined by other fms and uhf tvs moving in from elsewhere in the metropolitan area  the destruction of the world trade center necessitated a great deal of shuffling of antennas and transmitter rooms to accommodate the stations moving back uptown

observation decks
the empire state building has one of the most popular outdoor observatories in the world  having been visited by over 110million people  the 86th-floor observation deck offers impressive 360-degree views of the city  there is a second observation deck on the 102nd floor that is open to the public  it was closed in 1999  but reopened in november 2005  it is completely enclosed and much smaller than the first one  it may be closed on high-traffic days  tourists may pay to visit the observation deck on the 86th floor and an additional amount for the 102nd floor  the lines to enter the observation decks  according to   are  as legendary as the building itself   there are five of them  the sidewalk line  the lobby elevator line  the ticket purchase line  the second elevator line  and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck  for an extra fee tourists can skip to the front of the line  the empire state building makes more money from tickets sales for its observation decks than it does from renting office space 
the skyscraper s observation deck plays host to several cinematic  television  and literary classics including     
and   in the latin american literary classic  giannina
the observation deck is the site of a pastoral revolution  shepherds take over the city of new york  the deck was also the site of a publicity-stunt martian invasion in an episode of

the empire state building also has a
attraction located on the 2nd floor  opened in 1994 as a complement to the observation deck  the new york sky ride  or ny sky ride  is a simulated aerial tour over the city  the cinematic presentation lasts approximately 25minutes  as of may 2013  tickets are adults  57  children  42  seniors  49

since its opening  the ride has gone through two incarnations  the original version  which ran from 1994 until around 2002  featured  
  as the airplane s pilot  who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm  with the tour taking an unexpected route through the subway  coney island  and fao schwartz  among other places  after the september 11 attacks in 2001  however  the ride was closed  and an updated version debuted in mid-2002 with actor
as the pilot  the new version of the narration attempted to make the attraction more educational  and included some minor post-9/11 patriotic undertones with retrospective footage of the world trade center  the new flight also goes haywire  but this segment is much shorter than in the original 
lights
in 1964  floodlights were added to illuminate the top of the building at night  since 1976 the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal and other events  such as    
and   after the eightieth birthday and subsequent death of   for example  the building was bathed in blue light to represent the singer s nickname  ol  blue eyes   after the death of actress
