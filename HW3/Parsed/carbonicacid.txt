the
at 25c is called kh  which in the case of carbonic acid is  h2co3   co2   1.7103 in pure water and  1.2103 in   hence  the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid  remaining as co2 molecules  in the absence of a   the equilibrium is reached quite slowly  the
are 0.039s1 for the forward reaction  co2 h2o h2co3  and 23s1 for the reverse reaction  h2co3 co2  h2o   carbonic acid is used in the making of   inexpensive and artificially carbonated sparkling wines  and other bubbly drinks  the addition of two molecules of water to co2 would give   c oh 4  which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution 
addition of base to an excess of carbonic acid gives
 hydrogen carbonate   with excess base  carbonic acid reacts to give
salts 
because carbon dioxide is non-polar  it cannot dissolve in the bloodstream to travel to the lungs  as such 
converts carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid  which is polar and thus can travel through the body  in the lungs  carbonic anhydrase converts carbonic acid back into water and carbon dioxide to expel carbon dioxide through the lungs without losing water 
role of carbonic acid in blood  
carbonic acid is an intermediate step on the transport of co2 out of the body via   the hydration reaction of co2 is generally very slow in the absence of a catalyst  but
contain   which both increases the reaction rate and dissociates a hydrogen ion  h   from the resulting carbonic acid  leaving
 hco3  dissolved in the   this catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs  where it converts the bicarbonate back into co2 and allows it to be expelled  this equilibration plays an important role as a
in mammalian blood  a 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may have pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum 
role of carbonic acid in ocean chemistry  
the oceans of the world have absorbed almost half of the co2 emitted by humans from the burning of fossil fuels  it has been theorized that the extra dissolved carbon dioxide has caused the ocean s average surface ph to shift by about 0.1 unit from pre-industrial levels  this theory is known as  
acidity of carbonic acid  
carbonic acid is one of the   it is  it has two protons  which may dissociate from the parent molecule  thus  there are two   the first one for the dissociation into the
 also called hydrogen carbonate  ion hco3

care must be taken when quoting and using the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid  in aqueous solution  carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide  and the concentration of h2co3 is much lower than the concentration of co2  in many analyses  h2co3 includes dissolved co2  referred to as co2 aq    h2co3  is used to represent the two species when writing the aqueous chemical equilibrium equation  the equation may be rewritten as follows 
h2co3   hco3   h 
ka app    4.47107  pk app    6.35 at 25c and
  0.0
whereas this apparent pka is quoted as the dissociation constant of carbonic acid  it is ambiguous  it might better be referred to as the acidity constant of dissolved carbon dioxide  as it is particularly useful for calculating the
of co2-containing solutions  a similar situation applies to
 h2so3   which exists in equilibrium with substantial amounts of unhydrated  
the second constant is for the dissociation of the
ion into the
ion co32

we see that in the total range of pressure  the ph is always largely lower than pka2 so that the co32 concentration is always negligible with respect to hco3 concentration  in fact co32 plays no quantitative role in the present calculation  see remark below

spectroscopic studies of carbonic acid  
theoretical calculations show that the presence of even a single molecule of water causes carbonic acid to revert to carbon dioxide and water  in the absence of water  the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid is predicted to be very slow  with a
of 180,000 years  this may only apply to isolated carbonic acid molecules  however  as it has been predicted to catalyze its own decomposition 
the longstanding belief was that pure carbonic acid cannot be obtained at room temperatures  about 20c  or about 70f  due to its catalytic destruction by water  it has been discovered that it can be generated by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy radiation and then warming to remove the excess water  the carbonic acid that remains is characterized by infrared spectroscopy  the fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid h2o   co2 mixture may suggest that h2co3 might be found in outer space  where frozen ices of h2o and co2 are common  as are cosmic rays and ultraviolet light  to help them react  the same carbonic acid polymorph  denoted beta-carbonic acid  was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum  which causes protonation of bicarbonate  followed by removal of the solvent  the previously suggested alpha-carbonic acid  which was prepared by the same technique using methanol rather than water as a solvent was shown to be a monomethyl ester ch3ocooh
