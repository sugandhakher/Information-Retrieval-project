the united states environmental protection agency  epa or sometimes usepa  is an
of the
which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by   the epa was proposed by president
and began operation on december 2  1970  after nixon signed an   the
was ratified by committee hearings in the house and senate  the agency is led by its   who is appointed by the
and approved by congress  the current administrator is   the epa is not a
department  but the administrator is normally given  
the epa has its headquarters in   regional offices for each of the agency s ten   and 27 laboratories  the agency conducts environmental assessment  research  and education  it has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws  in consultation with state  tribal  and local governments  it delegates some permitting  monitoring  and enforcement responsibility to
and the   epa enforcement powers include fines    and other measures  the agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts 
the agency has approximately 15,193 full-time employees and engages many more people on a contractual basis  more than half of epa human resources are engineers  scientists  and environmental protection specialists  other groups include legal  public affairs  financial  and information technologists

history  
stacks emitting smoke from burning discarded automobile batteries  photo taken in houston in 1972 by     official photographer of recently founded epa
same smokestacks in 1975 after the plant was closed in a push for greater environmental protection
beginning in the late 1950s and through the 1960s  congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment  a key legislative option to address this concern was the declaration of a national environmental policy  advocates of this approach argued that without a specific policy  federal agencies were neither able nor inclined to consider the environmental impacts of their actions in fulfilling the agency s mission    the statute that ultimately addressed this issue was the
 nepa  42 u s c   43214347   senator
proposed and helped write s 1075  the bill that eventually became the national environmental policy act  the law was signed by president nixon on january 1  1970  nepa was the first of several major environmental laws passed in the 1970s  it declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a council on environmental quality  ceq  in the     to implement the national policy  nepa required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment  the  detailed statement  would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement  eis  
ruckelshaus sworn in as first epa administrator 
in 1970  president richard nixon proposed an executive reorganization that would consolidate many of the federal government s environmental responsibilities under one agency  a new environmental protection agency  that reorganization proposal was reviewed and passed by the house and senate 
staff recall that in the early days there was an enormous sense of purpose and excitement and the expectation that there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country  leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up americas environment 
for at least 10 years before nepa was enacted    congress debated issues that the act would ultimately address    the act was modeled on the resources and conservation act of 1959  introduced by senator
in the   that bill would have established an environmental advisory counsel in the office of the president  declared a national environmental policy  and required the preparation of an annual environmental report    in the years following the introduction of senator murray s bill  similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and congress s potential responses to perceived problems  in 1968  a joint house-senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the senate committee on interior and insular affairs  senator henry m  jackson  and the house committee on science and astronautics  representative   to discuss the need for and potential means of implementing a national environmental policy  in the colloquium  some members of congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment 
when epa first began  the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad  and the agencys first administrator  william ruckelshaus  felt pressure to show a public that was deeply skeptical about governments effectiveness that epa could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution 
the epa began regulating
 ghgs  from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the
for the first time on january 2  2011  standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to section 202 of the caa  and ghgs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of part c of title i of the act  see the page

project in the early 1970s 
this section is missing information about several major epa programs  please expand the section to include this information  further details may exist on the    october 2010 
it is worth noting that  in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning  administrator william ruckelshaus observed that a danger for epa was that air  water  waste and other programs would be unconnected  placed in silos  a problem that persists more than 50 years later  albeit less so than at the start 
epa safer choice  
the
label  previously known as the design for the environment  dfe  label  helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients  without sacrificing quality or performance  when a product has the safer choice label  it means that every intentionally - added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by epa scientists  only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the safer choice label 
safer detergents stewardship initiative  
through the
 sdsi   epa s design for the environment  dfe  recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer   safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water    commonly referred to as npes  are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant 
the design for the environment  which was renamed to
in 2015  has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates  these safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available  cleangredients is a source of safer surfactants 
energy star  
main article 
in 1992 the epa launched the energy star program  a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency 
smartgrowth  
epa s smart growth program helps communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want  epa works with local  state  and national experts to discover and encourage development strategies that protect human health and the environment  create economic opportunities  and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels 
pesticides  
epa administers the
 fifra   which is much older than the agency  and registers all
legally sold in the united states 
fuel economy  
manufacturers selling
in the united states are required to provide epa
test results for their vehicles and the manufacturers are not allowed to provide results from alternate sources  the fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicle s
certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests 
the current testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used
designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in
during that era  prior to 1984 the epa reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test  in 1984  the epa began adjusting city  aka
or   results downward by 10  and highway  aka highway fuel economy test or hwfet  results by 22  to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972 and to better correlate the epa test results with real-world driving  in 1996  the epa proposed updating the federal testing procedures to add a new higher speed test  us06  and an air-conditioner on test  sc03  to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports  the updated testing methodology was finalized in december  2006 for implementation with model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures 
in february 2005  the organization launched a program called  your mpg  that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the epa s fuel economy website and compare them with others and the original epa test results 
it is important to note that the epa actually conducts these tests on very few vehicles   while the public mistakenly presumes that this federal agency is hard at work conducting complicated tests on every new model of truck  van  car  and suv  in reality  just 18 of the epa s 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in ann arbor  michigan  examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year  or roughly 15 percent of new models  as to that other 85 percent  the epa takes automakers at their wordwithout any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate   two-thirds of the vehicles the epa tests themselves are selected randomly  and the remaining third are tested for specific reasons 
although originally created as a reference point for fossil fuelled vehicles  driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will do on a single charge 
air quality  
the air quality modeling group  aqmg  is in the epa s office of air and radiation  oar  and provides leadership and direction on the full range of
models 
and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing pollution control strategies and the impacts of air pollution sources 
the aqmg serves as the focal point on
techniques for other epa headquarters staff  epa regional offices  and state and local environmental agencies  it coordinates with the epa s office of research and development  ord  on the development of new models and techniques  as well as wider issues of atmospheric research  finally  the aqmg conducts modeling analyses to support the policy and regulatory decisions of the epa s office of air quality planning and standards  oaqps  
the aqmg is located in    
addressing air quality issues helps diminish the risk of  
oil pollution  
the
rule applies to all facilities that store  handle  process  gather  transfer  store  refine  distribute  use or consume oil or oil products  oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as  animal fats  oils and greases  fish and marine mammal oils  and vegetable oils   including oils from seeds  nuts  fruits  and kernels   mandates that a written plan is required for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground  and may reasonably be expected to discharge to navigable waters as defined in the clean water act or adjoining shorelines  secondary containment mandated at oil storage facilities  oil release containment is required at oil development sites

main article 
epa ensures safe
for the public  by setting standards for more than 160,000
nationwide  epa oversees states  local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the   the program includes regulation of
in order to protect underground sources of drinking water  select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water  precipitation  and surface water  in addition to milk and air  are reported on epa s
in a section entitled   in certain cases  readings exceeding epa mcl levels are deleted or not included despite mandatory reporting regulations  a draft of revised epa regulations relaxes the regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water  stating that current standards are impractical to enforce  the epa is recommending that intervention is not necessary until drinking water is contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter  the limit for short term exposure set by the international atomic energy agency   which is 27,000 times the current epa limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure 
national pollutant discharge elimination system  
the national pollutant discharge elimination system  npdes  permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the united states  created in 1972 by the clean water act  the npdes permit program is authorized to state governments by epa to perform many permitting  administrative  and enforcement aspects of the program 
radiation protection  
epa has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation 
radioactive waste management
emergency preparedness and response programs
protective action guides and planning guidance for radiological incidents
epa developed the manual to provide guideline for local and state governments to protect public from  
epa cleanup and multi-agency programs
risk assessment and federal guidance programs
naturally-occurring radioactive materials program
air and water programs
radiation source reduction and management
tools for schools  
the rate of asthma in children is increasing at a pace that underscores the need for schools to address indoor air problems  epa s indoor air quality tools for schools program helps maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants  the program helps school personnel identify  solve  and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment  through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building  schools can also lower their students  and staff s risk of exposure to asthma triggers 
environmental education  
the national environmental education act of 1990 requires epa to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy  epa established the office of environmental education to implement this program 
environmental impact statement reviews  
epa is responsible for reviewing
of other federal agencies  projects  under the
 nepa  
clean school bus usa  
clean school bus usa is a national partnership to reduce children s exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling  installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones  its goal is to reduce both children s exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses

advance identification  
advance identification  or adid  is a planning process used by the epa to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material  the epa conducts the process in cooperation with the u s 
and local states or   as of february 1993  38 adid projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing

controversies  
epa headquarters in
there has been political controversy   over whether environmental regulations generally increase or decrease national employment 
the  lt2  drinking water controversy  
in 2005  the epa issued the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule  lt2   the rule requires covering open-air reservoirs containing finished drinking water  in order to reduce the incidence of disease caused by microorganisms in drinking water 
to comply with the rule the epa ordered that a cap be placed over the   the open reservoir where water bound for new york citys receives its final disinfection before entering the pipelines that serve the city  a number of city and state officials complained that the project was too costly and unnecessary  the hillview project is currently being reviewed by the epa 
in portland  oregon  there was opposition to capping its reservoirs from a local citizens group and city officials  but recently the city has decided to stop fighting and bring its reservoirs into compliance with lt2 
fiscal mismanagement  
epa director anne m  gorsuch resigned under fire in 1983 during a scandal over mismanagement of a  1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps  gorsuch based her administration of the epa on the
approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states  she believed that the epa was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective  during her 22 months as agency head  she cut the budget of the epa by 22   reduced the number of cases filed against polluters  relaxed clean air act regulations  and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides  she cut the total number of agency employees  and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating 
contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters  and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency 
in 1982 congress charged that the epa had mishandled the  1.6 billion toxic waste
and demanded records from gorsuch  gorsuch refused and became the first agency director in u s  history to be cited for   the epa turned the documents over to congress several months later  after the white house abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoened by congress because they were covered by   at that point  gorsuch resigned her post  citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation  critics charged that the epa was in a shambles at that time 
fuel economy  
in july 2005  an epa report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed  the report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it  but at the last minute the epa delayed its release 
the state of california sued the epa for its refusal to allow california and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars  epa administrator
claimed that the epa was working on its own standards  but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level  which would then preempt state laws  california governor   along with governors from 13 other states  stated that the epa s actions ignored federal law  and that existing california standards  adopted by many states in addition to california  were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards  it was reported that stephen johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision 
after the federal government bailed out
and
in the   the 2010
was released with epa fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors  independent road tests found that the vehicle did not out-perform its competitors  which had much lower fuel economy ratings  later road tests found better  but inconclusive  results

global warming  
wikinews has related news 
in december 2007  epa administrator stephen l  johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfarea decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations  associate deputy administrator jason burnett e-mailed the draft to the white house  white house aideswho had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate changeknew the gist of what johnson s finding would be  burnett said  they also knew that once they opened the attachment  it would become a public record  making it controversial and difficult to rescind  so they did not open it  rather  they called johnson and asked him to take back the draft  u s  law clearly stated that the final decision was the epa administrator s  not president bush s  johnson rescinded the draft  in july 2008  he issued a new version which did not state that
was danger to public welfare  burnett resigned in protest 
libraries  
in 2004  the agency began a strategic planning exercise to develop plans for a more virtual approach to library services  the effort was curtailed in july 2005 when the agency proposed a  2.5 million cut in its 2007 budget for libraries  based on the proposed 2007 budget  the epa posted a notice to the   september 20  2006 that epa headquarters library would close its doors to walk-in patrons and visitors on october 1  2006  the epa also closed some of its regional libraries and reduced hours in others  using the same fy 2007 proposed budget numbers 
on october 1  2008  the agency re-opened regional libraries in  
and
and the library at its headquarters in  
in june 2011  the epa library network published a strategic plan for fiscal years 20122014 
mercury emissions  
in march 2005  nine states  california  new york  new jersey  new hampshire  massachusetts  maine  connecticut  new mexico and vermont  sued the epa  the epa s inspector general had determined that the epa s regulation of
emissions did not follow the clean air act  and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees  the epa had suppressed a study it commissioned by
which contradicted its position on mercury controls  the suit alleges that the epa s rule allowing exemption from  maximum available control technology  was illegal  and additionally charged that the epa s system of pollution credit trading allows power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions  several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations  illinois s proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90  by 2009 
9/11 air ratings  
main article 
an august 2003 report released by epa s inspector general claimed that the white house put pressure on the epa to delete cautionary information about the air quality in new york city around ground zero following the september 11  2001 attacks 
an environmental protection agency employee checks one of the many air sampling locations set up around the  
very fine airborne particulates  
tiny particles  under 2.5 micrometres  are attributed to health and mortality concerns  so some health advocates want the epa to regulate it  the science may be in its infancy  although many conferences have discussed the trails of this airborne matter in the air  foreign governments such as australia and most
have addressed this issue 
the epa first established standards in 1997  and strengthened them in 2006  as with other standards  regulation and enforcement of the pm2.5 standards is the responsibility of the state governments  through  
political pressure and scientific integrity  
in april 2008  the
said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 epa staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work  the survey included chemists  toxicologists  engineers  geologists and experts in other fields of science  about 40  of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years  the highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life 
epa research has also been suppressed by career managers  supervisors at epa s national center for environmental assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about epa s integrated risk information system  which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication  and the corresponding author  ching-hung hsu  to leave epa  because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing   epa subjects employees who author scientific papers to   even if those papers are written on personal time  a  3 million mapping study on
was suppressed by epa management during both the bush and obama administrations  and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps  epa employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on
due to industry and governmental pressure  and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports 
in 2015  the
stated that the epa violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms  the social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the
rule  including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule 
environmental justice  
the epa has been criticized for its lack of progress towards   administrator
was criticized for her changes to president bill clinton s
12898 during 2001  removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation  and therefore defeating the spirit of the executive order  in a march 2004 report  the
of the agency concluded that the epa  has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan  and has not established values  goals  expectations  and performance measurements  for environmental justice in its daily operations  another report in september 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs  policies and activities towards environmental justice  studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the epa s
program  and that this situation was worsening 
barriers to enforcing environmental justice  
localization  
many issues of environmental justice are localized  and are therefore hard to be addressed by federal agencies such as the epa  without significant media attention  political interest  or  crisis  status  local issues are less likely to be addressed at the local or federal level  with a still developing sector of environmental justice under the epa  small  local incidents are unlikely to be solved compared to larger  well publicized incidents 
conflicting political powers  
the white house maintains direct control over the epa  and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power  republicans and democrats differ in their approaches to  and perceived concerns of  environmental justice  while president bill clinton signed the executive order 12898  the bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices  which in turn affected the motivation for environmental enforcement 
responsibilities of the epa  
the epa is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes  informing the public of environmental enforcement  and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution  water pollution  hazardous wastes and chemicals  while the epa aids in preventing and identifying hazardous situations  it is hard to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities  it is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to  the epa answers to various groups  competes for resources  and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment  all of these present challenges  including a lack of resources  its self-policing policy  and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for epa officers 
authority of the epa  
under different circumstances  the epa faces many limitations to enforcing environmental justice  it does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities
