rationale for renewables  
renewable energy technologies encompass a broad  diverse array of technologies  including  
plants and heating cooling systems     
plants  and
and the use of  
the report
explains that america needs renewable energy  for many reasons 
america needs energy that is secure  reliable  improves public health  protects the environment  addresses climate change  creates jobs  and provides technological leadership  america needs renewable energy  if renewable energy is to be developed to its full potential  america will need coordinated  sustained federal and state policies that expand renewable energy markets  promote and deploy new technology  and provide appropriate opportunities to encourage renewable energy use in all critical energy market sectors  wholesale and distributed electricity generation  thermal energy applications  and transportation 
another benefit of some renewable energy technologies  like wind and solar photovoltaics  pv  is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas thermoelectric  fossil fuel based  power plants require vast amounts of water for operation 
in 2009  president
in the
called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of
and   those were the first references ever to the nation s energy use  to renewable resources  and to climate change in an inauguration speech of a u s  president  president obama looked to the near future  saying that as a nation  the united states will  harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories  
the president s
plan calls for a federal investment of  150 billion over the next decade to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future  specifically  the plan calls for renewable energy to supply 10  of the nation s electricity by 2012  rising to 25  by 2025 
in his
in 2009  obama stated that   we know the country that harnesses the power of clean  renewable energy will lead the 21st  century    thanks to our   we will double this nations supply of renewable energy in the next three years    it is time for america to lead again  
according to   there s little doubt that the future of energy will be cleaner  the transition from carbon-intensive energy sources like wood  coal  and oil to natural gas and renewables  is well underway  for much of the developed world  and for developing nations  the  future looks increasingly like it will be built off of a mix of energy efficiency  renewables  the electrification of transport  and lower carbon fuels like natural gas  
a 2010 survey conducted by applied materials shows that two-thirds of americans believe solar technology should play a greater role in meeting the country s energy needs  in addition   three-quarters of americans feel that increasing renewable energy and decreasing u s  dependence on foreign oil are the country s top energy priorities   according to the survey   67 percent of americans would be willing to pay more for their monthly utility bill if their utility company increased its use of renewable energy  
in a 2010
public opinion survey  an overwhelming 91 percent believed  investing in renewable energy  is important for the united states to remain economically competitive with other countries  with 62 percent considering this very important  the same poll found strong support for tax incentives to encourage development of renewable energy sources specifically as a way to reduce foreign energy imports  eight in ten  80 percent  favored tax incentives  47 percent strongly  and only 17 percent were opposed 
as of 2011  new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources  and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed 
several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain  new epa initiatives targeting air toxics  coal ash  and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies  the use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny  with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions  concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants  particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages  events at the
have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term  further  cost estimates for next generation nuclear units continue to climb  and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees 
current trends  
percentage of electricity in the us generated from renewable sources 1950-2012  hydropower in blue and other renewable sources in red 
renewable energy in the united states accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015  california is a leading state and around 29 percent of california s electricity comes from rps eligible renewable sources  including hydropower  
the united states has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world  which have the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nation s energy demand  a quarter of the u s  land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal 
many of the new technologies that harness renewables  including wind  solar  geothermal  and biofuels  are  or soon will be  economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85 percent of u s  energy needs  dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies  energy technologies also receive government subsidies  in 2013  federal government energy-specific subsidies and supports for renewables  fossil fuels  and nuclear were  15.043 billion   3.431 billion and  1.66 billion respectively  the subsidies and supports specific to electricity production amount to  11.678 billion   1.591 billion and  1.66 billion respectively 
all but a few u s  states now have incentives in place to promote renewable energy  while more than a dozen have enacted new renewable energy laws in recent years 
renewable energy suffered a political setback in the united states in september 2011 with the bankruptcy of   a company that had received a  535 million federal loan guarantee

solar power  
solar power will be discussed in three distinct varieties   electric energy is generated by two different methods -thermal and photovoltaic  application is either utility scale for electric grid power generation or much smaller distributed systems which may or may not be integrated into the electric grid  utility grade systems have well documented generation but distributed systems contributions to user electric power needs are not measured or controlled  therefore  quantitative evaluation of distributive solar to the overall us electric power environment has been lacking  recently  the energy information administration  has begun estimating that contribution 
2006-2015 solar electric energy with 2014-2015 estimated distributed solar
in 2015  utility scale solar contributed 26.47 g kwh  billion kwh  to the grid with 23.233 g kwh from photovoltaics and 3.24 g kwh from thermal systems  in 2014 and 2015  eia estimated that distributed solar  generated 9.536 g kwh and 12.141 g kwh respectively

solar water heating  
the u s  department of energy stated  in 2006  that more than 1.5 million homes and businesses were currently using
in the united states  representing a capacity of over 1,000 megawatts  mw  of thermal energy generation  it predicted that another 400 mw was likely to be installed over the next 35 years 
assuming that 40 percent of existing homes in the united states have adequate access to sunlight  29 million solar water heaters could be installed 
solar water heaters can operate in any climate  performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site  as well as how cold the water coming into the system is  the colder the water  the more efficiently the system operates 
solar water heaters reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds and pay for their installation within 4 to 8 years with electricity or natural gas savings  compared to those with electric water heaters  florida homeowners with solar water heaters save 50 to 85 percent on their water heating bills  according to the florida solar energy center 
biomass  
main article 
in 2015  biomass generated 64.19 million megawatt-hours  1.57  of total us generated electricity  it was the largest source of total renewable energy in the us  and the third-largest renewable source of electrical power in the us  after hydropower and wind 
biomass is biological material derived from living  or recently living organisms  such as plants and trees and utilizes wastes or plant matter specifically grown to generate electricity or produce heat  the main advantage of using grown fuels  as opposed to fossil fuels such as coal  natural gas and oil  is that while they are growing they absorb the near-equivalent in carbon dioxide  an important greenhouse gas  to that which is later released in their burning  although there is some debate over the net carbon neutrality and near term affects of using the biomass for energy a key difference is the relatively short carbon recycle period of grown biomass  several years or decades  as opposed to the millions of years it took to turn carbon into fossil fuels  with proper conservation and growing techniques biomass can be an important renewable energy source 
biomass can be utilized for all three major energy needs  electricity  heating cooling and transportation fuels  however  each usage is distinctly different from the others  especially regarding efficiency - the percentage of energy utilized from the biomass source  whereas pellets for heating can be up to 90  efficient  bio-electricity plants are comparable to coal power plants  with around 30  efficiency  and biofuels from crops or algae even less 
biomass electric generation data combines two basic categories  1  wood and wood derived fuels including wood wood waste solids  including paper pellets  railroad ties  utility poles  wood chiips  bark and wood waste solids   wood waste liquids  red liquor  sludge wood  spent sulfite liquor  and other wood based liquids   and black liquor  and  2  other biomass fuels include municipal solid waste  landfill gas  sludge waste agricultural byproducts  other biomass solids  other biomass liquids  and other biomass gases  including digester gases  methane  and other biomass gases   the contribution from these two categories over the last ten years of biomass electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the electric power generation for 2014 and 2015  this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to fuel availability and needs

main article 
most cars on the road today in the u s  can run on blends of up to 10    and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends      and
are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars  trucks  and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85  ethanol  e85   by mid-2006  there were approximately six million e85-compatible vehicles on u s  roads 
the challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date  flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability  the   which calls for 15.2billion us gallons  58,000,000m3  of biofuels to be used annually by 2012  will also help to expand the market 
the expanding ethanol and
industries are providing jobs in plant construction  operations  and maintenance  mostly in rural communities  according to the renewable fuels association  the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 u s  jobs in 2005 alone  boosting household income by  5.7 billion  it also contributed about  3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local  state  and federal levels  on the other hand  in 2010  the biofuel industry received  6644 million in federal government support

wave power in the united states is under development in several locations off the east   west coasts as well as hawaii  it has moved beyond the research phase and is producing reliable energy  its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such  the power output is currently modest  but major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years   
renewable energy research  
there are numerous organizations within the academic  federal  and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy  this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum  most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields  multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years  two of the most prominent of these labs are
and the
 nrel   both of which are funded by the
and supported by various corporate partners  sandia has a total budget of  2.4 billion while nrel has a budget of  375 million 
both
and the
 nrel   have heavily funded solar research programs 
was also heavily invested in solar research programs until 2008 when the company began scaling back its solar operations  the company finally shut down its forty-year-old solar business after executives decided solar power production is not economically competitive  the nrel solar program has a budget of around  75 million and develops research projects in the areas of
 pv  technology  solar thermal energy  and solar radiation  the budget for sandias solar division is unknown  however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratorys  2.4 billion budget  several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years  the solar energy research center  serc  at
 unc  has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology  in 2008  researchers at
 mit  developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water  such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining  in february 2012  north carolina-based semprius inc   a solar development company backed by german corporation   announced that they had developed the worlds most efficient solar panel  the company claims that the prototype converts 33.9  of the sunlight that hits it to electricity  more than double the previous high-end conversion rate 
wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when
developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds  today  both
and
have programs dedicated to wind research  sandias laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials  aerodynamics  and sensors  the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production  reducing their capital costs  and making wind energy more cost effective overall  the field laboratory for optimized wind energy  flowe  at
was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost  size  and environmental impact of wind energy production 
as the primary source of biofuels in north america  many organizations are conducting research in the area of
production  on the federal level  the
conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the united states  much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets  the
has conducted various ethanol research projects  mainly in the area of  
has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol  it does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood  grasses  or non-edible parts of plants  moreover  some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol 
conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research and is also a member of the
 jbei   a research institute founded by the
with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels 
over  1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the united states  both the
and
have departments dedicated to hydrogen research 
policy and promotion  
in his january 24  2012 
address  president
restated his commitment to renewable energy  stating that he will not walk away from the promise of clean energy  obama called for a commitment by the
to purchase 1,000 mw of renewable energy  he also mentioned the long-standing
commitment to permit 10,000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012 
the
included more than  70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for
and associated transportation programs  this policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in u s  history for   advanced transportation  and
initiatives  these new initiatives were expected to encourage many more utilities to strengthen their clean energy programs  while the department of energy has come under criticism for providing loan guarantees to solyndra  its sunshot initiative has funded successful companies such as
and  
initiatives  
sunshot  
in february 2011  the
 doe  launched its sunshot initiative  a collaborative national effort to cut the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75  by 2020  reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity and get
  the sunshot initiative included a crowdsourced innovation program run in partnership with   during which 17 different solar energy application solutions were developed in 60 days

the epa named the top 20 partners in its green power partnership that are generating their own renewable energy on-site  combined  they generate more than 736 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy on-site each year  enough to power more than 61,000 average u s  homes 
renewable portfolio standards  
a
refers to legislation that creates a market in tradeable renewable or green electricity certificates  electricity distributors or wholesaler purchasers of electricity are required to source a specified percentage of their electricity  portfolio  from renewable generation sources  liable entities that fall short of their quota can purchase certificates from accredited suppliers who have generated renewable electricity and obtained and registered certificates to sell on that market 
sales to the grid  
the
requires all
to facilitate   this allows homes and businesses performing
to pay only the net cost of electricity from the grid  electricity used minus electricity produced locally and sent back into the grid  for intermittent renewable energy sources this effectively uses the grid as a
to smooth over lulls and fill in production gaps 
some jurisdictions go one step further and have instituted   which allows any power customer to actually make money by producing more renewable energy than is consumed locally 
distribution effects  
from 2006-14  us households received more than  18 billion in federal income
for
their homes  installing solar panels  buying hybrid and electric vehicles  and other  clean energy  investments  these tax expenditures went predominantly to higher-income americans  the bottom three income quintiles received about 10  of all credits  while the top quintile received about 60   the most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles  where the top income quintile received about 90  of all credits  market mechanisms have less skewed distributional effects
