energy star  trademarked energy star  is an international standard for
products originated in the   it was created in 1992 by the
and the   since then            and the
have adopted the program  devices carrying the energy star service mark  such as computer products and peripherals  kitchen appliances  buildings and other products  generally use 2030  less energy than required by federal standards  in the united states  the energy star label is also shown on
appliance label of qualifying products

history  
the energy star program was developed by   inventor of the green programs at epa  working closely with the it industry  and implemented by
and brian johnson  the program was intended to be part of a series of voluntary programs  such as green lights and the methane programs  that would demonstrate the potential for profit in reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gases by  
initiated as a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and promote
products  energy star began with labels for computer and
products  in 1995 the program was significantly expanded  introducing labels for residential heating and cooling systems and new homes  at this time  newly formed energy efficiency programs  administered by ratepayer funded entities such as utilities  agreed through the
to begin promoting their programs using the energy star brand  in 2000  the consortium for energy efficiency was directed by members to begin an annual survey of energy star impact 
as of 2006  more than 40,000 energy star products were available in a wide range of items including major appliances  office equipment  lighting  home electronics  and more  in addition  the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings  in 2006  about 12 percent of new housing in the
was labeled energy star 
the epa estimates that it saved about  14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone  the energy star program has helped spread the use of
  efficient  
systems for office equipment  and low
energy use 
in 2008  the epa announced the green power partnership program  which was designed to help achieve its goal of encouraging the use of
sources  the renewable energy credits  rec  allow companies without direct access to renewable power the ability to achieve their goals  however  to avoid companies buying recs years in advance of any of the hypothetical power ever being produced  recs are only accepted into the program when the actual equivalent renewable power will be produced 
specifications  
energy star specifications differ with each item  and are set by either the environmental protection agency or the department of energy  the following highlights product and specification information available on the
computers  
energy star 4.0 specifications for computers became effective on july 20  2007  the requirements are more stringent than the previous specification and existing equipment designs can no longer use the service mark unless re-qualified  they require the use of
bronze level or higher   energy star 5.0 became effective on july 1  2009 
servers  
the epa released version 1.0 of the computer server specifications on may 15  2009  it covers standalone servers with one to four   a second tier to the specification adding active state power and performance reporting for all qualified servers  as well as blade and multi-node server idle state requirements is expected in 2013 
appliances  
as of early 2008  average
need 20  savings over the minimum standard  dishwashers need at least 41  savings  most appliances as well as heating and cooling systems have a yellow energyguide label showing the annual cost of operation compared to other models  this label is created through the
and often shows if an appliance is energy star  while an energy star label indicates that the appliance is more energy efficient than the minimum guidelines  purchasing an energy star labeled product does not always mean one is getting the most energy efficient option available  for example  dehumidifiers that are rated under 25 us pints  12l  per day of water extraction receive an energy star rating if they have an
of 1.2  higher is better   while those rated 25 us pints  12l  to 35 us pints  17l  per day receive an energy star rating for an energy factor of 1.4 or higher  thus a higher-capacity but non-energy star rated dehumidifier may be a more energy efficient alternative than an energy star rated but lower-capacity model  the energy star program s savings calculator has also been criticized for unrealistic assumptions in its model that tend to magnify savings benefits to the average consumer 
another factor yet to be considered by the epa and doe is the overall effect of energy-saving requirements on the durability and expected service life of a mass-market appliance built to a consumer-level cost standard  for example  a refrigerator may be made more efficient by the use of more insulative spacing and a smaller-capacity compressor using electronics to control operation and temperature  however  this may come at the cost of reduced interior storage  or increased exterior mass  or a reduced service life due to compressor or electronic failures  in particular  electronic controls used on new-generation appliances are subject to damage from shock  vibration  moisture  or power spikes on the electrical circuit to which they are attached  critics have pointed out that even if a new appliance is energy efficient  any consumer appliance that does not provide customer satisfaction  or must be replaced twice as often as its predecessor contributes to landfill pollution and waste of natural resources used to construct its replacement 
heating and cooling systems  
energy star qualified heat pumps  boilers  air conditioning systems  and furnaces are available  in addition  cooling and heating bills can be significantly lowered with air sealing and duct sealing  air sealing reduces the outdoor air that penetrates a building  and duct sealing prevents attic or basement air from entering ducts and lessening the heating cooling systems efficiency  energy star qualified
are at least 10  more energy efficient than the minimum u s  federal government standards 
home electronics  
energy star qualified televisions use 30  less energy than average  in november 2008  television specifications were improved to limit on-mode power use  in addition to
which is limited by the current specifications  a wider range of energy star qualified televisions will be available  other qualified home electronics include cordless phones  battery chargers  vcrs and external power adapters  most of which use 90  less energy 
imaging equipment  
the energy star program requirements for imaging products are focused on product families such as electrophotographic  ep  printers  inkjet printers  e g   thermal   copiers  facsimile machines and other imaging equipment including  s  multifunctional devices   typical electrical consumption  tec  of a product family are measured and reported against an allowance set by the maximum throughput of the device  operation modes  om  are measured and reported for devices such as inkjet products against an allowance set by the functions present in the eut  equipment under test   devices that included  adders  such as ethernet  on-board memory  wireless  etc  are mathematically  added  to increase the om allowance  recently on february 1  2011  the epa doe added the requirement that all products registered under the energy star service mark  must be tested by an ab  accredited body  or cb  certification body  laboratory 
lighting  
the energy star is awarded to only certain bulbs that meet strict efficiency  quality  and lifetime criteria 
energy star qualified
uses 75  less energy and lasts up to ten times longer than normal  
energy star qualified
 led  lighting 
reduces energy costs uses at least 75  less energy than incandescent lighting  saving on operating expenses 
reduces maintenance costs lasts 35 to 50 times longer than incandescent lighting and about 2 to 5 times longer than fluorescent lighting  no bulb-replacements  no ladders  no ongoing disposal program 
reduces cooling costs leds produce very little heat 
to qualify for energy star certification  led lighting products must pass a variety of tests to prove that the products will display the following characteristics 
brightness is equal to or greater than existing lighting technologies  incandescent or fluorescent  and light is well distributed over the area lighted by the fixture 
light output remains constant over time  only decreasing towards the end of the rated lifetime  at least 35,000 hours or 12 years based on use of 8 hours per day  
excellent color quality  the shade of white light appears clear and consistent over time 
efficiency is as good as or better than fluorescent lighting 
light comes on instantly when turned on 
no flicker when dimmed 
no off-state power draw  the fixture does not use power when it is turned off  with the exception of external controls  whose power should not exceed 0.5 watts in the off state 
new homes  
new homes that meet strict guidelines for energy efficiency can qualify for energy star certification  an energy star qualified home uses at least 15  less energy than standard homes built to the 2003 international residential code  irc   they usually include properly installed   high performance windows  tight construction and ducts  energy efficient cooling and heating systems  and energy star qualified appliances  lighting  and water heaters 
further information 
energy performance ratings  
the u s  epa s energy star program has developed energy performance rating systems for several commercial and institutional building types and manufacturing facilities  these ratings  on a scale of 1 to 100  provide a means for
the energy efficiency of specific buildings and industrial plants against the energy performance of similar facilities  the ratings are used by building and energy managers to evaluate the energy performance of existing buildings and industrial plants  the rating systems are also used by epa to determine if a building or plant can qualify to earn energy star recognition 
for many types of commercial buildings  one can enter energy information into epa s free online tool  portfolio manager  and it will calculate a score for one s building on a scale of 1-100  buildings that score a 75 or greater may qualify for the energy star  portfolio manager is an interactive energy management tool that allows one to track and assess energy and water consumption across one s entire portfolio of buildings in a secure online environment  whether one owns  manages  or holds properties for investment  portfolio manager can help one set investment priorities  identify under-performing buildings  verify efficiency improvements  and receive epa recognition for superior energy performance  portfolio manager uses an automated benchmarking tool that can award energy star certification to buildings that have uploaded 12 months of consecutive energy usage data and received scores of 75 or above 
buildings  
the number of space types that can receive the energy performance rating in portfolio manager is expanding and now includes housing  bank financial institutions  courthouses  hospitals  acute care and children s   hotels and motels  houses of worship  k-12 schools  medical offices  offices  residence halls dormitories  retail stores  supermarkets  warehouses  refrigerated and non-refrigerated   data centers  senior care facilities  and wastewater facilities 
see the technical descriptions for models used in the rating system at  these documents provide detailed information on the methodologies used to create the energy performance ratings including details on rating objectives  regression techniques  and the steps applied to compute a rating  a 1-100 rating can be generated for ratable space types by entering building attributes  such as square footage and weekly operating hours  and monthly energy consumption data into   a free online tool provided by energy star  this process is known as benchmarking and reveals how a building s energy consumption compares to that of other similar buildings of the same space type  based on a national average  earning a rating of 75 or above is the first step towards achieving the energy star for a building 
energy star energy performance ratings have been incorporated into some green buildings standards  such as leed for existing buildings

small business award  
the u s  environmental protection agency  epa  annually recognizes small businesses that demonstrate abilities to reduce waste  conserve energy  and recycle  the businesses use resources and ideas outlined in the energy star program  the award was established in 1999 
controversies  
on december 17  2008  the epa office of the inspector general released its report on the energy star program  the inspector general s audit found that the program s claims regarding greenhouse gas reductions were inaccurate and based on faulty data  additionally  the ig found that energy star program s reported energy savings were unreliable  and that many of the touted benefits could not be verified   deficiencies included the lack of a quality review of the data collected  reliance on estimates  forecasting  and unverified third party reporting  and the potential inclusion of exported items   the report concluded 
additionally  the     and the trade website applianceadvisor com  have released statements claiming that energy star test procedures contained loopholes that allow many inefficient products to receive energy star labels  specific claims include 
u s  department of energy regulations allowed the manufacturers to test the refrigerators with their ice-makers turned off  which is not how they are normally used in the home  however  the energy star requirements usually exclude refrigerators that include an ice maker because of the penetration of the ice dispenser  some designs get around this by dispensing the ice into a tray located in the freezer 
using outdated testing rules and loose standards to award energy star ratings 
the program allows manufacturers to test their own products and only selectively spot-checks the test results they submit 
there are so many individually rated refrigerator categories that even inefficient product categories  such as side-by-sides  are certified 
before the complaints were raised in 2008  2006 federal court had required the doe to update and tighten misleading energy star ratings given to products in almost two dozen categories  including dishwashers  air conditioners  heaters  furnaces and clothes dryers  the updates were to settle complaints by 14 states  however  categories such as room air conditioners and clothes dryers would not be completed until june 2011 
the u s  environmental protection agency had released reports in 2007 and 2008 claiming energy star labels were misleading  inspector general issued a report that said energy star s savings claims were  not accurate or verifiable   the report also found that shipment data for energy star products were not being adequately reviewed and in some cases  were based on estimates instead of actual shipping totals 
revealed that energy star standby mode requirement can be compromised when an electronic device uses download acquisition mode  dam  feature to update tv guide listing during standby mode  hellman first found the feature on
kdl-37xbr6 
in march 2010  a report by the
stated that the energy star program had accepted 15 out of 20 bogus products submitted for approval  the energy star program had also qualified four businesses as energy star partners  failing to catch the fact that information on the companies  products and staff were all fictitious 
in 2011  epa has tried to remedy this problem by requiring third-party verification of all products  epa now requires products  destined for the us market  to be tested for qualification in an epa-recognized laboratory and certified as meeting the energy star requirements by a third-party certification program
