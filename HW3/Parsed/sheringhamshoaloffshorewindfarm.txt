sheringham shoal offshore wind farm is a
in
off the coast of norfolk  a lease for use of the sea bed was obrained in 2004 by scira offshore energy  later acquired by
and    the development gained offshore planning consent in 2008  and was constructed 2009-2011  being officially opened in 2012 
the windfarm has 88
3.6mw turbines  total power 316.8 mw  spread over a 35km2  14sqmi  area over 17km  11mi  from shore

history  
in 2004 the
awarded econventures  utrecht  nl  the lease of the
site at sheringham shoal  econventures together with slp energy  lowestoft  uk  formed a joint venture scira offshore energy to develop a c  315mw wind farm  development work for econventures was to be carried out by evelop bv  both subsidiaries of   in 2005
took a 50  stake in scira  acquiring 25  shareholdings from both slp energy and ecocentures 
in 2006 scira submitted a planning application to the
for a 108 turbine  315 mw wind farm 
the planned wind farm was approximately 18 kilometres  11mi  off the coast of norfolk at   just within the 12nm uk territorial water boundary  and 5 kilometres  3.1mi  north of the
known as sheringham shoal  the wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 metres  52 to 72ft  and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines  benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities  lack of any dredging  dumping  oil gas  or mod practice areas  and of cables or pipelines  as well as low visual impact from the coast  and outside any nature conservation areas  the seabed at the windfarm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly gravely sand  overlying chalk  the electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near   via landfall near   two routes were considered for the export cable  one avoiding the sand bank atsheringham shoal  the connection to the
was planned to be made at an electrical substation near
via a 132kv 21.3 kilometres  13.2mi  underground cable 
planning consent for the wind farm was given on 8 august 2008 
in 2009
acquired 50  of the shareholding in scira becoming joint  50 50  owners of the development  in 2014 the
took a 240 million 20  stake in the wind farm 
the lease on the sea bed given by the crown estate has a duration of 50 years  and the  initial  wind farm has an estimated lifespan of 20 years  the
requires the developer to decommission the wind farm once out of use - the decommissioning plan submitted by the developer included  removal of wind turbines  cutting of foundations at seabed level or lower  whilst interarray cables would be left on the sea bed 
construction  
turbine installation vessel gms endeavour  30 september 2011 
in april 2008
was awarded a 24m contract for the supply and construction of the 145kv export cables  and was awarded a 12m   15.8m  contract in april 2009 to supply 81km of 36kv inter-array cables 
obtained a 50 million contract to supply offshore and onshore substations in late 2008  design and project management of the offshore substations was sub-contracted to  
design work on the turbine and substation foundations was contracted to   the two foundations for the substations and foundations for 88 turbines were supplied by   manufacture of the turbine monopiles and transition pieces was subcontracted to
and   the substation superstructure and foundations were subcontracted to
 topside  
 transition pieces  and
and
 piles   in 2009
obtained a 450 million contract to supply 88 wind turbines to the wind farm 
onshore work began in 2009  and construction of the offshore part began march 2010  turbine foundations installation begain in june 2010  mt hjgaard installed the substation piles and 17 of the turbine foundations  using the vessel svanen  halting installation due to a previously scheduled contract for the installation vessel  the foundations installed by mt hjgaard used a special method  the support of the foundation on the delivery barge had its motion steadied by a 135t sliding support with
compensating for wave oscillations  delays of several months of the arrival of foundation transport vessels  coupled with wave conditions limiting the operational window of use of the transport vessels  meant that the vessel svanen was not able to install all the foundations  the delay had an estimated additional cost of 600million nok   
export cable installation began late 2010  under contract to visser   smith marine contracting  work was carried out by the ships atlantic guardian  route clearance   team oman  laying   and vos sympathy  trenching  
the offshore substations were installed in may 2011 by heerema  the remaining pile foundations  and the transition pieces and offshore substation topsides where installed by seaway heavy lifting between may and aug 2011 using the newly built oleg strashnov  a previous contract with
for the substation installation was cancelled and transferred to seaway due to the delays  foundation and transition piece installation was complete by aug 2011 
inter-array cables were laid by team oman  and installed under the sea bed by water jetting by toisa warrior  installation was complete by mar 2012 
the turbine installation was contracted to
in dec 2010  the initial contract with
was terminated by mutual agreement after the foundation installation delays  turbine installation was carried out by the
sea jackand gms endeavour  with sea jack replaced by sea jack leviathan in late 2011  the first turbine was installed on 3 july 2011  and began generating in aug 2011  installation was complete by july 2012 
operations bases  
as part of the development the harbour and channel at
was dredged to allow wind farm maintenance vessels to be based there  a 150 metres  490ft  pontoon jetty was also built  the work was completed early 2010  an onshore operations base was constructed at   3 miles south of   with building work taking place in 2012 
operation  
the wind farm was operational by late 2011  an official opening took place on september 27  2012 attended by norway s
and uk secretary of state   the cost of development has been estimated at 10billion norwegian krona   1.8 billion  
is used as the operational base for the wind farm 
in june 2013 a consortium   blue transmission       acquired the electrical transmission assets of the wind farm for 193 million  in aug 2013
took over operations and maintenance of the windfarm from scira  statoil takes over operation from statkraft  beginning in 2017  while also increasing its share in the proposed  
by sep 2013 the wind farm had generated 1.2twh in its first year of operation
