the mercedes-benz bionic was a

under the
group  it was first introduced in 2005 at the daimlerchrysler innovation symposium in
the bionic was modelled after a type of   the   ostracion cubicus  and also has 80  lower

engine and performance  
the bionic is powered by a 103kw direct-injection
that gives out around 70
  3.36 l 100km   this engine also gives out around a total of 140 horsepower  100kw  and a little over 221ftlbf  300nm  of
at around 1600   the bionic can go from 0-60 in about 8 seconds and has a top speed of a little over 190km h  118mph   
design  
the exterior design was modelled after the yellow boxfish     a marine fish that lives in coral reefs  mercedes-benz decided to model the bionic after this fish due to the supposed low
of its body shape and the rigidity of its   this influenced the car s unusual looks  other parts of the design include the fact that the rear wheels are partially fitted with plastic and that it s considered as a lightweight vehicle  mercedes-benz reported a
of 0.19  for comparison  the production vehicle with the lowest ever cd value was the   at 0.195  while the bionic had a much larger internal volume than the ev1  the bionic s larger frontal area made the ev1 more aerodynamic overall  as drag is a product of the area and the drag coefficient
