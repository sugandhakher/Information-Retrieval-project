theory  
the intention of sustainable design is to  eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful  sensitive design   manifestations of sustainable design require   impact the environment minimally  and connect people with the natural environment 
great design is sustainable design  rather than considering green building design as an externality  architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design  this includes better user experience and comfort  doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance  and maximizing the effectives of durable  quality materials  rather than the well-known edict form follows function  its time to think form follows environment 
beyond the  elimination of negative environmental impact   sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour  a dynamic balance between economy and society  intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences 
conceptual problems  
diminishing returns  
the principle that all directions of progress run out  ending with diminishing returns  is evident in the typical  s  curve of the
and in the useful life of any system as discussed in
and   diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits  common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity  the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere     see also   
and   
unsustainable investment  
a problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see  so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the   but may lead to a collapse  this problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by
among others  this natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the
and   among others  relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them  not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not 
waste prevention

negative effects of waste
about 80 million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the u k  alone  for example  each year  and with reference to only household waste  between 1991/92 and 2007/08  each person in england generated an average of 1.35 pounds of waste per day 
experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal  all forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment  public health  and local economies  landfills have contaminated drinking water  garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air  soil  and water  the majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology  attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts 
the toxic components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem  in the u s   about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials  such as
like       and
from batteries  and
found in pesticides and consumer products  such as air freshener sprays  nail polish  cleaners  and other products  when burned or buried  toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment 
the only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation  pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem  it does not mean doing without  but doing differently  for example  preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages  it just means using refillable bottles 
waste prevention strategies in planning for facilities  a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste  a good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through   this would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment 
any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste  materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors  the following waste prevention strategies apply to both  although different approaches will be needed for implementation 
use products that minimize waste and are nontoxic
compost or anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes
reuse materials onsite or collect suitable materials for offsite recycling
sustainable design principles  
the   san francisco  california  is a sustainable building designed by renzo piano  it opened on september 27  2008
 
 
while the practical application varies among disciplines   some common principles are as follows 
low-impact materials  choose non-toxic  sustainably produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process
energy efficiency  use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy
  reducing consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and products  through design
design for reuse and    products  processes  and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial  afterlife   
for total
and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available   many are complex  but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts  one measure estimates any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use of 8,000btu  8,400kj  per dollar and producing co2 at the average rate of 0.57kg of co2 per dollar  1995 dollars us  from doe figures 
and project design guides are also increasingly available and are vigorously being developed by a wide array of private organizations and individuals  there is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as  sustainability science  promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions 
   redesigning industrial systems on biological lines     enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous closed cycles    
  shifting the mode of consumption from personal ownership of products to provision of services which provide similar functions  e g   from a private automobile to a
service  such a system promotes minimal resource use per unit of consumption  e g   per trip driven  
  materials should come from nearby  local or    sustainably managed renewable sources that can be
when their usefulness has been exhausted 
  robust design principles are applied to the design of a pollution sources 
the physics principle
that accounts for the urge to have sustainability  and for the evolutionary design in general  is the  
bill of rights for the planet  
a model of the new design principles necessary for
is exemplified by the  bill of rights for the planet  or  hannover principles  - developed by william mcdonough architects for expo 2000 that was held in  
the bill of rights 
insist on the right of humanity and nature to co-exist in a healthy  supportive  diverse  and sustainable conditions 
recognize interdependence  the elements of human design interact with and depend on the natural world  with broad and diverse implications at every scale  expand design considerations to recognizing even distant effects 
respect relationships between spirit and matter  consider all aspects of human settlement including community  dwelling  industry  and trade in terms of existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness 
accept responsibility for the consequences of design decisions upon human well-being  the viability of natural systems  and their right to co-exist 
create safe objects of long-term value  do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creations of products  processes  or standards 
eliminate the concept of waste  evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes  to approach the state of natural systems in which there is no waste 
rely on natural energy flows  human designs should  like the living world  derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income  incorporating this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use 
understand the limitations of design  no human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems  those who create and plan should practice humility in the face of nature  treat nature as a model and mentor  not an inconvenience to be evaded or controlled 
seek constant improvement by the sharing of knowledge  encourage direct and open communication between colleagues  patrons  manufacturers and users to link long term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility  and re-establish the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity 
these principles were adopted by the world congress of the international union of architects  uia  in june 1993 at the american institute of architects   aia  expo 93 in   further  the aia and uia signed a  declaration of interdependence for a sustainable future   in summary  the declaration states that today s society is degrading its environment and that the aia  uia  and their members are committed to 
placing environmental and social sustainability at the core of practices and professional responsibilities
developing and continually improving practices  procedures  products  services  and standards for sustainable design
educating the building industry  clients  and the general public about the importance of sustainable design
working to change policies  regulations  and standards in government and business so that sustainable design will become the fully supported standard practice
bringing the existing built environment up to sustainable design standards 
in addition  the interprofessional council on environmental design  iced   a coalition of architectural  landscape architectural  and engineering organizations  developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design  iced states  the ethics  education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future        to achieve this vision we will join       as a multidisciplinary partnership  
these activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive  the world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources 
applications  
applications of this philosophy range from the
 small objects for everyday use  through to the
 buildings  cities  and the earth s physical surface  it is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of                
and  
sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global environmental crises  the rapid growth of economic activity and human population  depletion of natural resources  damage to   and loss of   in 2013  eco architecture writer
surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book  urgent architecture  40 sustainable housing solutions for a changing world  featured projects focus on   sustainable design 
materials      and   construction methods and materials include repurposed    
homes  and  
the limits of sustainable design are reducing  whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency  as a result  the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts  the present approach  which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services  does not solve this problem  the basic dilemmas include  the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements  the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones  that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized  but are distributed throughout the economies  and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing 
examples  
beauty and sustainable design  
because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics  some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration 
winner
has called green building  bogus   and
winner
has dismissed it as  having nothing to do with architecture   in 2009 
asked whether  well-designed green architecture  is an  oxymoron  
others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided  a leading advocate for this alternative view is architect   whose book
 2012  was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty  hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful  but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed  creating things of even greater beauty  reviewers have suggested that the ideas in the shape of green could  revolutionize what it means to be sustainable   small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs  examples include
and the  
emotionally durable design  
stain teacups  bethan laura wood  2009
according to
of the   uk  emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of
by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products   essentially  product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties  in his book  emotionally durable design  objects  experiences   empathy  chapman describes how  the process of consumption is  and has always been  motivated by complex emotional drivers  and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things  it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self  that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment  becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction   therefore  a product requires an attribute  or number of attributes  which extend beyond utilitarianism 
according to chapman   emotional durability  can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements 
narrative  how users share a unique personal history with the product 
consciousness  how the product is perceived as autonomous and in possession of its own free will 
attachment  can a user be made to feel a strong emotional connection to a product 
fiction  the product inspires interactions and connections beyond just the physical relationship 
surface  how the product ages and develops character through time and use 
as a strategic approach   emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible  well made  tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term   according to hazel clark and david brody of
in new york  emotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users  as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to  and in  design things 
eco fashion and home accessories  
discussion by julianna osk hafberg of likka fashion brand at the reykjavk art museum
creative designers and artists are perhaps the most inventive when it comes to
or creating new products from old waste  a growing number of designers
waste materials such as car window glass and recycled ceramics  textile offcuts from upholstery companies  and even decommissioned fire hose to make belts and bags  whilst accessories may seem trivial when pitted against green scientific breakthroughs  the ability of fashion and retail to influence and inspire consumer behaviour should not be underestimated  eco design may also use bi-products of industry  reducing the amount of waste being dumped in landfill  or may harness new sustainable materials or production techniques e g  fabric made from recycled pet plastic bottles or bamboo textiles 
sustainable architecture  
main article 
sustainable building design
sustainable architecture is the design of   sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components  during the construction process  as well as during the
of the building  heating  electricity use  carpet cleaning etc   this design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems 
sources such as   appropriate building siting  reused or recycled building materials  on-site power generation - solar technology  ground source heat pumps  wind power 
for gardening  washing and
recharge  and on-site
such as
that filter and control stormwater runoff  this requires close cooperation of the design team  the architects  the engineers  and the client at all project stages  from site selection  scheme formation  material selection and procurement  to project implementation 
sustainable architects design with
in mind  sustainable vs
is the challenge that designs not only reflect healthy processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources  a test for sustainable design is  can the design function for its intended use without
 unplugged  this challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution  as technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested  architects will soon be able to create not only passive  null-emission buildings  but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design  in 2004 the 59 home housing community  the   and a 60,000sqft  5,600m2  integrated retail  commercial and residential building  the   were completed by architect
in     the
is the first housing community worldwide in which every home  all 59  produce a positive energy balance 
an essential element of sustainable building design is indoor environmental quality including air quality  illumination  thermal conditions  and acoustics  the integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure  ashrae guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards

sustainable landscape and garden design  
main articles      and
sustainable landscape architecture is a category of sustainable design and
concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space  plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation  design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind  using local materials  and on-site composting and chipping not only to reduce
hauling but to increase

soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to

sustainable technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as           and   wind energy is the world s fastest growing energy source  it has been in use for centuries in
and more recently in the
and other nations  wind energy is captured through the use of
that generate and transfer electricity for utilities  homeowners and remote villages  solar power can be harnessed through   concentrating solar  or
and is also a rapidly growing energy source 
the availability  potential  and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan  the plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local  regional  and global environments  responsible energy use is fundamental to
and a sustainable future  energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply  the process couples energy awareness  energy conservation  and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources

sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner 
beyond the use of certain technologies  sustainable design in water management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts  among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100  of water destined for consumption  that is not necessarily for drinking purposes  is of potable water quality  this concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called  fit-for-purpose   this more rational use of water achieves several economies  that are not only related to water itself  but also the consumption of energy  as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons 
terminology  
in some countries the term sustainable design is known as  
or     embraced
and social quality and ecological quality  but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term  sustainable design and design for sustainability are more common terms  including the
 people  planet and profit    
in the eu  the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign  little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the
package  that the european commission will be tabling by the end of 2015  to this effect  an ecothis eu campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package 
sustainable technologies  
sustainable technologies use less energy  fewer limited resources  do not deplete natural resources  do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment  and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life  there is significant overlap with   which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context  in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries  however  the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one  and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an  appropriate technology   as that term is commonly used
