coal   col  meaning  mineral of fossilized carbon  since the thirteenth century  is a
black or brownish-black
usually occurring in
in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams  the harder forms  such as   can be regarded as
because of later exposure to elevated temperature and   coal is composed primarily of   along with variable quantities of other elements  chiefly       and   a   coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into   which in turn is converted into   then sub-bituminous coal  after that   and lastly   this involves biological and geological processes that take place over time 
throughout history  coal has been used as an energy resource  primarily burned for the production of electricity and heat  and is also used for industrial purposes  such as refining metals  coal is the largest source of energy for the
worldwide  as well as one of the largest worldwide
sources of

etymology  
the word originally took the form col in   from
 kula n   which in turn is hypothesized to come from the
root  g e u-lo-  live coal  
cognates include the

word gual is also a cognate via the
root  in old turkic languages  kl is  ash es   cinders   r is  quench   the compound  charcoal  in turkic is r lm  kl  literally  quenched ashes  cinders  coals  with elided anlaut - and inflection affixes -lm 
the word took on the meaning  mineral consisting of fossilized carbon  in the thirteenth century 
formation  
example chemical structure of coal
at various times in the geologic past  the earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas  due to natural processes such as flooding  these forests were buried underneath soil  as more and more soil deposited over them  they were compressed  the temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper  as the process continued the plant matter was protected from
and   usually by mud or acidic water  this trapped the carbon in immense
that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments  under high pressure and high temperature  dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal  as coal contains mainly carbon  the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization 
the wide  shallow seas of the
period provided ideal conditions for coal formation  although coal is known from most geological periods  the exception is the coal gap in the   where coal is rare  coal is known from
strata  which predate land plants  this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae

chinese coal miners in an illustration of the tiangong kaiwu encyclopedia  published in 1637
the earliest recognized use is from the
area of china 4000 bc where
inhabitants had begun carving ornaments from black lignite  coal from the fushun mine in northeastern china was used to smelt copper as early as 1000 bce    the italian who traveled to china in the 13th century  described coal as  black stones    which burn like logs   and said coal was so plentiful  people could take three hot baths a week  in europe  the earliest reference to the use of coal as fuel is from the geological treatise on stones  lap  16  by the
scientist
 circa 371287 bc  
among the materials that are dug because they are useful  those known as anthrakes  coals  are made of earth  and  once set on fire  they burn like charcoal  they are found in liguria    and in elis as one approaches olympia by the mountain road  and they are used by those who work in metals

which turn
and create electricity  the
of this process has been improved over time  some older coal-fired power stations have thermal efficiencies in the vicinity of 25  whereas the newest
and  ultra-supercritical  steam cycle turbines  operating at temperatures over 600c and pressures over 27 mpa  over 3900 psi   can practically achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of 45   lhv basis  using anthracite fuel  or around 43   lhv basis  even when using lower-grade lignite fuel  further thermal efficiency improvements are also achievable by improved pre-drying  especially relevant with high-moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass  and cooling technologies 
an alternative approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the
 igcc  power plant  instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler  the coal can be first gasified  see   to create   which is burned in a
to produce electricity  just like natural gas is burned in a turbine   hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a
which powers a supplemental   thermal efficiencies of current igcc power plants range from 39  to 42   hhv basis  or  4245   lhv basis  for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies  shell  ge gasifier  cb i   igcc power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions  and allow for relatively easy carbon capture 
at least 40  of the world s electricity comes from coal  and in 2012  about one-third of the united states  electricity came from coal  down from approximately 49  in 2008  as of 2012 in the united states  use of coal to generate electricity was declining  as plentiful supplies of natural gas obtained by
of tight shale formations became available at low prices 
in denmark  a net electric efficiency of   47  has been obtained at the coal-fired nordjyllandsvrket chp plant and an overall plant efficiency of up to 91  with cogeneration of electricity and district heating  the multifuel-fired avedrevrket chp plant just outside copenhagen can achieve a net electric efficiency as high as 49   the overall plant efficiency with cogeneration of electricity and district heating can reach as much as 94

coking coal and use of coke  
main article 
coke oven at a
plant in  
coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash  low-sulfur bituminous coal  metallurgical coal   from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000c  1,832f   so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together  metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a
in smelting
ore in a   the result is   and is too rich in dissolved carbon  so it must be treated further to make   the coking coal should be low in
and   so they do not migrate to the metal  based on the ash percentage  the coking coal can be divided into various grades  these grades are 
steel grade i  ash content not exceeding 15  
steel grade ii  exceeding 15  but not exceeding 18  
washery grade i  exceeding 18  but not exceeding 21  
washery grade ii  exceeding 21  but not exceeding 24  
washery grade iii  exceeding 24  but not exceeding 28  
washery grade iv  exceeding 28  but not exceeding 35  
the coke must be
to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace  which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route  however  the alternative route is   where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron  coke from coal is grey  hard  and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million btu ton  29.6 mj kg   some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts  including     light oils  and  
is the solid residue obtained in   which resembles coke  but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications 
gasification  
main articles 
and
coal gasification can be used to produce   a mixture of
 co  and hydrogen  h2  gas  often syngas is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity  but the versatility of syngas also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels  such as gasoline and diesel  through the   alternatively  syngas can be converted into   which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process  gasification combined with fischer-tropsch technology is currently used by the
chemical company of
to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas  alternatively  the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes  such as powering a   making ammonia  or upgrading fossil fuels 
during gasification  the coal is mixed with
and
while also being heated and pressurized  during the reaction  oxygen and water molecules
the coal into carbon monoxide  co   while also releasing
gas  h2   this process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of  
c  as coal    o2   h2o  h2   co
if the refiner wants to produce gasoline  the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a fischer-tropsch reaction  if hydrogen is the desired end-product  however  the syngas is fed into the   where more hydrogen is liberated

in the past  coal was converted to make coal gas     which was piped to customers to burn for illumination  heating  and cooking 
liquefaction  
main article 
coal can also be converted into
equivalent to
or
by several different direct processes  which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion   in the direct liquefaction processes  the coal is either
or   hydrogenation processes are the   the src-i and src-ii  solvent refined coal  processes  the nus corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes  in the process of low-temperature   coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750c  680 and 1,380f   these temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar  the coal tar is then further processed into fuels  an overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available 
coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide  co2  emissions in the conversion process  if coal liquefaction is done without employing either
 ccs  technologies or biomass blending  the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from   if ccs technologies are employed  reductions of 512  can be achieved in
plants and up to a 75  reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass  30  biomass by weight  in coal biomass-to-liquids plants  for future
projects 
is proposed to avoid releasing co2 into the atmosphere  sequestration adds to the cost of production 
refined coal  
main article 
refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite  brown  coals  it is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal s characteristics before it is burned  the goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned  depending on the situation  precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers 
industrial processes   
finely ground bituminous coal  known in this application as sea coal  is a constituent of   while the molten metal is in the   the coal burns slowly  releasing
at pressure  and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand  it is also contained in  mould wash   a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting  sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining  the  bod   used for the bottom of a   when heated  the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable  easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal 
production of chemicals  
production of chemicals from coal
coal is an important feedstock in production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products  the main route to these products is
to produce   primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include  
and   which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured  including        
and others  the versatility of
as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities 
historically  production of chemicals from coal has been used since the 1950s and has become established in the market  according to the 2010 worldwide gasification database  a survey of current and planned gasifiers  from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its gasification product share from 37  to 45   from 2008 to 2010  22  of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production 
because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from
and   the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective  therefore  interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production  also  production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like south africa  china  india and the united states where there are abundant coal resources  the abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in china is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there  in the united states  the best example of the industry is eastman chemical company which has been successfully operating a coal-to-chemicals plant at its kingsport  tennessee  site since 1983  similarly  sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in south africa 
coal to chemical processes do require substantial quantities of water  as of 2013 much of the coal to chemical production was in the people s republic of china where environmental regulation and

breathing in
causes
which is known colloquially as  black lung   so-called because the coal dust literally turns the lungs black from their usual pink color  in the united states alone  it is estimated that 1500 former employees of the coal industry die every year from the effects of breathing in coal mine dust 
around 10  of coal is ash 
is hazardous and toxic to human beings and other living things  coal ash contains the radioactive elements
and   coal ash and other solid combustion byproducts are stored locally and escape in various ways that expose those living near coal plants to radiation and environmental toxics 
huge amounts of coal ash and other waste is produced annually  in 2013  the us alone consumed on the order of 983 million short tonnes of coal per year  use of coal on this scale generates hundreds of millions of tons of ash and other waste products every year  these include     and
sludge  that contain         and other   along with non-metals such as  
the   the   and the

more recently  the chicago school of public health released a largely similar report  echoing many of the same findings 
though coal burning has increasingly been supplanted by less-toxic natural gas use in recent years  a 2010 study by the clean air task force still estimated that  air pollution from coal-fired power plants accounts for more than 13,000 premature deaths  20,000 heart attacks  and 1.6 million lost workdays in the u s  each year   the total monetary cost of these health impacts is over  100 billion annually

environmental effects  
and coal fueling of
and industrial processes can cause major environmental damage 
water systems are affected by coal mining  for example  mining affects
and
levels and acidity  spills of fly ash  such as the   can also contaminate land and waterways  and destroy homes  power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water  this can affect the flows of rivers  and has consequential impacts on other land uses 
one of the earliest known impacts of coal on the water cycle was   approximately 75 tg s per year of
 so2  is released from burning coal  after release  the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous h2so2 which scatters solar radiation  hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate  this beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases  however  the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks  whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years  release of so2 also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems 
disused coal mines can also cause issues  subsidence can occur above tunnels  causing damage to infrastructure or cropland  coal mining can also cause long lasting fires  and it has been estimated that thousands of
are burning at any given time  for example  there is a
that has been burning since 1668  and is still burning in the 21st century 
some environmental impacts are modest  such as dust nuisance  however  perhaps the largest and most long term effect of coal use is the release of carbon dioxide  a
that causes
and   according to the
and the   coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of co2 in the atmosphere 
the production of coke from coal produces   coal tar  and gaseous compounds as by-products which if discharged to land  air or waterways can act as environmental pollutants  the
is one example of a coke producing facility where liquid ammonia is discharged to the marine environment 
in 1999  world gross
from coal usage were 8,666 million tonnes of carbon dioxide  in 2011  world gross emissions from coal usage were 14,416 million tonnes  for every megawatt-hour generated  coal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide  which is almost double the approximately 1100 pounds of carbon dioxide released by a -fired electric plant  because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation  as the market in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation  carbon dioxide emissions may have fallen  those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992  in 2013  the head of the un climate agency advised that most of the world s coal reserves should be left in the ground to avoid catastrophic global warming 
clean coal technology  
main article 
 clean  coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation  those technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere  some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing
and impurities from the coal 
 see also    improved technology for treating
gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency 
technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the
and dewatering lower rank coals    to improve the   and thus the efficiency of the conversion into   figures from the united states environmental protection agency show that these technologies have made today s coal-based generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced 
clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal  historically  the primary focus was on so2 and nox  the most important gases in causation of   and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health  more recent focus has been on carbon dioxide  due to its impact on   and concern over toxic species such as mercury  concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery  potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage  and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter 
an oxyfuel ccs power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the co2 so that it may be stored or sequestered
several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept 
pre-combustion capture  this involves
of a feedstock  such as coal  to form synthesis gas  which may be
to produce a h2 and co2-rich gas mixture  from which the co2 can be efficiently captured and separated  transported  and ultimately sequestered  this technology is usually associated with
process configurations 
post-combustion capture  this refers to capture of co2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes  typically using sorbents  solvents  or membrane separations to remove co2 from the bulk gases 
 fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen  rather than in air  which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient  low-cost co2 capture 
the   a 582 mw -based power plant  will use pre-combustion capture of co2 to capture 65  of the co2 the plant produces  which will be utilized geologically sequestered in
operations 
the saskatchewan government s boundary dam integrated carbon capture and sequestration demonstration project will use post-combustion  amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90  of the co2 emitted by unit 3 of the power plant  this co2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the weyburn oil fields 
an early example of a coal-based plant using  oxy-fuel  carbon-capture technology is swedish company  s
located in     built by german firm   which went on-line in september 2008  the facility captures co2 and acid rain producing pollutants  separates them  and compresses the co2 into a liquid  plans are to inject the co2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations  vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for co2 reduction in the atmosphere  but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical 
bioremediation  
the white rot fungus
can grow on and metabolize naturally occurring coal  the bacteria
has been found to degrade coal  raising its temperature 
economic aspects  
coal  by liquefaction technology  is one of the
that could limit escalation of
and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under   this is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum  estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic u s  production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around  35 per barrel  with the  35 being the break-even cost  with oil prices as low as around  40 per barrel in the u s  as of december 2008  liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the u s   but will probably be re-vitalized  similar to
projects  with an oil price around  70 per barrel 
in china  due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector  coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below  40 per barrel  this is probably because china prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil  instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves  as oil prices were increasing during the first half of 2009  the coal liquefaction projects in china were again boosted  and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of  40 
china is the largest producer of coal in the world  it is the world s largest energy consumer  and relies on coal to supply 69  of its energy needs  an estimated 5 million people worked in china s coal-mining industry in 2007 
coal pollution costs the eu 43 billion each year  measures to cut air pollution may have beneficial long-term economic impacts for individuals

the
of coal  i e  its   is roughly 24
per kilogram  approximately 6.7
per kg   for a coal power plant with a 40  efficiency  it takes an estimated 325kg  717lb  of coal to power a 100w lightbulb for one year 
as of 2006  the average efficiency of electricity-generating power stations was 31   in 2002  coal represented about 23  of total global energy supply  an equivalent of 3.4 billion tonnes of coal  of which 2.8 billion tonnes were used for electricity generation 
the us energy information agency s 1999 report on co2 emissions for energy generation quotes an emission factor of 0.963kg co2 kwh for coal power  compared to 0.881kg co2 kwh  oil   or 0.569kg co2 kwh  natural gas  
underground fires  
main article 
thousands of coal fires are burning around the world  those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished  fires can cause the ground above to subside  their combustion gases are dangerous to life  and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface   coal seams can be set on fire by
or contact with a
or surface fire  lightning strikes are an important source of ignition  the coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen  air  can no longer reach the flame front  a grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire  coal fires in china burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year  emitting 360 million metric tons of co2  amounting to 23  of the annual worldwide production of co2 from   in
 a

of the united states   an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill  located in an abandoned
pit  attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful  and it continues to burn underground to this day  the australian

production trends  
continental united states coal regions
coal output in 2005
a coal mine in   united states  the united states has the world s largest coal reserves 
in 2006  china was the top producer of coal with 38  share followed by the united states and india  according to the   as of 2012 coal production in the united states was falling at the rate of 7  annually with many power plants using coal shut down or converted to natural gas  however  some of the reduced domestic demand was taken up by increased exports with five
being proposed in the
to export coal from the
to china and other asian markets  however  as of 2013  environmental opposition was increasing  high-sulfur coal mined in illinois which was unsaleable in the united states found a ready market in asia as exports reached 13 million tons in 2012 
world coal reserves  
the 948 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the energy information administration are equal to about 4,196 bboe  billion    the amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7.075 billion short tons  or 133.179 quadrillion btu s  this is an average of 18.8 million btu per short ton  in terms of heat content  this is about 57,000,000 barrels  9,100,000m3  of oil equivalent per day  by comparison in 2007  natural gas provided 51,000,000 barrels  8,100,000m3  of oil equivalent per day  while oil provided 85,800,000 barrels  13,640,000m3  per day 
  in its 2007 report  estimated at 2006 end that there were 147 years
based on proven coal reserves worldwide  this figure only includes reserves classified as  proven   exploration drilling programs by mining companies  particularly in under-explored areas  are continually providing new reserves  in many cases  companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as  proven   however  some nations haven t updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals 
of the three fossil fuels  coal has the most widely distributed reserves  coal is mined in over 100 countries  and on all continents except   the largest reserves are found in the united states  russia  china  australia and india  note the table below
