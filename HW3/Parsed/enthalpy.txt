enthalpy
 symbol  h  is a measurement of
in a   it is the thermodynamic quantity equivalent to the total heat content of a system  it is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume 
more technically  it includes the   which is the energy required to create a system  and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its
and establishing its volume and pressure 
enthalpy is defined as a
that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the variables internal energy  pressure  and volume  it is an
quantity  the unit of measurement for enthalpy in the
 si  is the   but other historical  conventional units are still in use  such as the
and the  
the enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical  biological  and physical measurements at constant pressure  because it simplifies the description of   at constant pressure  the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work 
the total enthalpy  h  of a system cannot be measured directly  the same situation exists in classical mechanics  only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning  enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential  so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system  we must refer to a defined reference point  therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy  h  the h is a positive change in
reactions  and negative in heat-releasing
processes 
for processes under constant pressure  h is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system  plus the
that the system has done on its surroundings  this means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed  or released  by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer  enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure assume   most commonly 1 bar pressure  standard state does not  strictly speaking  specify a temperature  see    but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25c 
enthalpy of
and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure  unlike
and   real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior  which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses

origins  
the word enthalpy stems from the
verb enthalpein     which means  to warm in   it combines the
prefix
en-  meaning  to put into   and the verb
thalpein  meaning  to heat   the word enthalpy is often incorrectly attributed to
 1799-1864  and
through the 1850 publication of their   this misconception was popularized by the 1927 publication of   however  neither the concept  the word  nor the symbol for enthalpy existed until well after clapeyron s death 
the earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 1875  when
introduced  a heat function for constant pressure   however  gibbs did not use the word  enthalpy  in his writings 
the actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by j  p  dalton  according to that publication 
 18531926  actually coined the word 
over the years  scientists used many different symbols to denote enthalpy  in 1922 alfred w  porter proposed the symbol  h  as a standard  thus finalizing the terminology still in use today 
formal definition  
the enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as
h
 
u
 
p
v
 
  displaystyle h u pv  
where
h is the enthalpy of the system 
u is the
of the system 
p is the
of the system 
v is the
of the system 
the enthalpy is an   this means that  for homogeneous systems  the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system  it is convenient to introduce the specific enthalpy h h m  where m is the mass of the system  or the molar enthalpy hm h n  where n is the number of moles  h and hm are    for inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems 
h

  displaystyle h  sum   k h  k   
where the label k refers to the various subsystems  in case of continuously varying p  t  and or composition  the summation becomes an integral

  displaystyle h  int  rho h  dv  
where  is the density 
the enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function h s p  of the entropy s and the pressure p  and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows  we start from the
for closed systems for an infinitesimal process 
d

w
 
  displaystyle du  delta q- delta w  
here  q is a small amount of heat added to the system  and w a small amount of work performed by the system  in a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place  so the
gives q   tds  with t the
of the system  furthermore  if only pv work is done  w   pdv  as a result

physical interpretation  
the u term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system  and the pv term as the energy that would be required to  make room  for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant  when a system  for example  n
of a gas of
v at
p and
t  is created or brought to its present state from   energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy u plus pv  where pv is the
done in pushing against the ambient  atmospheric  pressure 
in basic
and
it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used  in basic   experiments are often conducted at constant   and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled  so that h is the expression chosen for the  
for a
a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the
done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine

relationship to heat  
in order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply  we return to the first law for closed systems  du   q  w  we apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface  in this case the work term can be split into two contributions  the so-called pv work  given by pdv  where here p is the pressure at the surface  dv is the increase of the volume of the system  and all other types of work w  such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction  so we write w   pdv   w  in this case the first law reads

from this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added

provided that the system is under
 dp 0  and that the only work done by the system is expansion work  w  0  
applications  
in thermodynamics  one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from  nothingness   the mechanical work required  pv  differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the  
must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system  assuming that the pressure p remains constant  this is the pv term  the supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy  u  which includes   ionization energies  mixing energies  vaporization energies  chemical bond energies  and so forth  together  these constitute the change in the enthalpy u pv  for systems at constant pressure  with no external work done other than the pv work  the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system 
for a simple system  with a constant number of particles  the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant

where
h is the  enthalpy change  
hf is the final enthalpy of the system  in a chemical reaction  the enthalpy of the products  
hi is the initial enthalpy of the system  in a chemical reaction  the enthalpy of the reactants  
for an
at constant   the system s change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction  including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings  in a similar manner  for an
reaction  the system s change in enthalpy is equal to the energy absorbed in the reaction  including the energy lost by the system and gained from compression from its surroundings  a relatively easy way to determine whether or not a reaction is exothermic or endothermic is to determine the sign of h  if h is positive  the reaction is endothermic  that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants  on the other hand  if h is negative  the reaction is exothermic  that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat 
specific enthalpy  
the specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as h   h m where m is the mass of the system  the
for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram  it can be expressed in other specific quantities by h   u   pv  where u is the specific   p is the pressure  and v is specific volume  which is equal to 1   where  is the density 
enthalpy changes  
an enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction  it is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed  i e  the enthalpy of the   and the initial enthalpy of the system  i e  the reactants  these processes are reversible   and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change 
a common standard enthalpy change is the   which has been determined for a large number of substances  enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works  such as the   the following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics 
when used in these recognized terms the qualifier change is usually dropped and the property is simply termed enthalpy of  process   since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters  or   including

open systems  
in
  matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries  the first law of thermodynamics for open systems states  the increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating  minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system

where uin is the average internal energy entering the system  and uout is the average internal energy leaving the system 
during
operation  an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added
the region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a   and it may or may not correspond to physical walls  if we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface  then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system  and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid  there are then two types of work performed  flow work described above  which is performed on the fluid  this is also often called pv work   and shaft work  which may be performed on some mechanical device 
these two types of work are expressed in the equation

with k the mass flow and k the molar flow at position k respectively  the term dvk dt represents the rate of change of the system volume at position k that results in pv power done by the system  the parameter p represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power  but it can also be e g  electric power produced by an electrical power plant 
note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet    otherwise  it has to be included in the enthalpy balance  during
operation of a device  see     and    the average du dt may be set equal to zero  this yields a useful expression for the average

nowadays the enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software  practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form  there are many types of diagrams  such as ht diagrams  which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures  and hp diagrams  which give h as function of p for various t  one of the most common diagrams is the temperaturespecific entropy diagram  ts-diagram   it gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps  these diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer

throttling

one of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process  also known as   it concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance  valve  porous plug  or any other type of flow resistance  as shown in the figure  this process is very important  since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators  where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator  it is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers

that is  the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling  the consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ts diagram above  point c is at 200bar and room temperature  300k   a joulethomson expansion from 200bar to 1bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425kj kg  not shown in the diagram  lying between the 400 and 450kj kg isenthalps and ends in point d  which is at a temperature of about 270k  hence the expansion from 200bar to 1bar cools nitrogen from 300k to 270k  in the valve  there is a lot of friction  and a lot of entropy is produced  but still the final temperature is below the starting value 
point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with h   100 kj kg  it corresponds roughly with p   13 bar and t   108 k  throttling from this point to a pressure of 1bar ends in the two-phase region  point f   this means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve  since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter  the enthalpy in f  hf  is equal to the enthalpy in g  hg  multiplied by the liquid fraction in f  xf  plus the enthalpy in h  hh  multiplied by the gas fraction in f  1  xf   so

for example  compressing 1kg of nitrogen from 1bar to 200bar costs at least  hc  ha   ta sc  sa   with the data  obtained with the ts diagram  we find a value of  430  461   300   5.16  6.85    476kj kg 
the relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

  displaystyle   frac  p   text min     dot  m     int   1   2  dh-t   mathrm  a     ds   
with dh   tds   vdp  this results in the final relation
