a condensing furnace
a large furnace is a
that is permanently installed to provide heat to an interior space through intermediary fluid movement  which may be     or hot   heating appliances that use steam or hot water as the fluid are normally referred to as a residential steam boiler or residential hot water boiler  the most common
source for modern furnaces in the united states is   other common fuel sources include
 liquefied petroleum gas    
or   in some cases
heating is used as the source of heat  especially where the cost of electricity is low 
modern high-efficiency furnaces can be 98 
and operate without a chimney  the small amount of waste gas and heat are mechanically ventilated through pvc pipes that can be vented through the side or roof of the house  fuel efficiency in a gas furnace is measured in
 annual fuel utilization efficiency  
categories  
residential furnaces can be classified into four general categories  based on efficiency and design 
natural draft  
diagram of natural draft gas furnace  early 20th century 
the first category would be natural draft  atmospheric burner furnaces  these furnaces consisted of cast-iron or riveted-steel heat exchangers built within an outer shell of brick  masonry  or steel  the heat exchangers were vented through brick or masonry chimneys  air circulation depended on large  upwardly pitched pipes constructed of wood or metal the pipes would channel the warm air into floor or wall vents inside the home  this method of heating worked because   the system was simple  had few controls  a single automatic gas valve  and no blower  these furnaces could be made to work with any fuel simply by adapting the burner area  they have been operated with wood  coke  coal  trash  paper  natural gas  and fuel oil  furnaces that used solid fuels required daily maintenance to remove ash and
that accumulated in the bottom of the burner area  in later years  these furnaces were adapted with electric blowers to aid air distribution and speed moving heat into the home  gas and oil-fired systems were usually controlled by a thermostat inside the home  while most wood and coal-fired furnaces were controlled by the amount of fuel in the burner and position of the fresh-air damper on the burner access door 
forced-air  
the second category of residential furnace is the forced-air  atmospheric burner style with a cast-iron or sectional steel heat exchanger  this style furnace was used to replace the big  natural draft systems  and was sometimes installed on the existing gravity duct work  the heated air was moved by blowers which were belt driven and designed for a wide range of speeds  these furnaces were still big and bulky compared to modern furnaces  and had heavy-steel exteriors with bolt-on removable panels  energy efficiency would range anywhere from just over 50  to upward of 65    this style furnace still used large  masonry or brick chimneys for flues and was eventually designed to accommodate air-conditioning systems 
forced draft  
the third category of furnace is the forced draft  mid-efficiency furnace with a steel
and multi-speed blower  these furnaces were physically much more compact than the previous styles  they were equipped with combustion air blowers that would pull air through the heat exchanger which greatly increased fuel efficiency while allowing the heat exchangers to become smaller  these furnace may have multi-speed blowers and were designed to work with central air-conditioning systems 
condensing  
the fourth category of furnace is the high-efficiency  or condensing furnace  high-efficiency furnaces can achieve from 89  to 98  fuel efficiency  this style of furnace includes a sealed combustion area  combustion draft inducer and a secondary   because the heat exchanger removes most of the heat from the exhaust gas  it actually condenses water vapor and other chemicals  which form a mild acid  as it operates  the vent pipes are normally installed with pvc pipe versus metal vent pipe to prevent corrosion  the draft inducer allows for the exhaust piping to be routed vertically or horizontally as it exits the structure  the most efficient arrangement for high-efficiency furnaces include pvc piping that brings fresh combustion air from the outside of the home directly to the furnace  normally the combustion air  fresh air  pvc is routed alongside the exhaust pvc during installation and the pipes exit through a sidewall of the home in the same location  high efficiency furnaces typically deliver a 25  to 35  fuel savings over a 60 
furnace 
heat distribution  
the furnace transfers heat to the living space of the building through an intermediary distribution system  if the distribution is through hot water  or other fluid  or through steam  then the furnace is more commonly called a   one advantage of a boiler is that the furnace can provide hot water for bathing and washing dishes  rather than requiring a separate   one disadvantage to this type of application is when the boiler breaks down  neither heating nor domestic hot water are available 
 octopus  furnace with oil burner 
air convection heating systems have been in use for over a century  but the older systems relied on a passive air circulation system where the greater density of cooler air caused it to sink into the furnace  and the lesser density of the warmed air caused it to rise in the ductwork  the two forces acting together to drive air circulation in a system termed  gravity-feed  the layout of the ducts and furnace was optimized for short  large ducts  this caused the furnace to be referred to as an  octopus  furnace 
forced-air gas furnace  design circa 1991 
by comparison  most modern  warm air  furnaces typically use a
to circulate air to the rooms of house and pull cooler air back to the furnace for reheating  this is called
heat  because the fan easily overcomes the
of the ductwork  the arrangement of ducts can be far more flexible than the octopus of old  in american practice  separate ducts collect cool air to be returned to the furnace  at the furnace  cool air passes into the furnace  usually through an air filter  through the blower  then through the heat exchanger of the furnace  whence it is blown throughout the   one major advantage of this type of system is that it also enables easy installation of central   simply by adding a cooling coil at the outlet of the furnace 
air is circulated through   which may be made of sheet metal or plastic  flex  duct  and is insulated or uninsulated  unless the ducts and
have been sealed using mastic or foil duct tape  the ductwork is likely to have a high leakage of conditioned air  possibly into unconditioned spaces  another cause of wasted energy is the installation of ductwork in unheated areas  such as attics and crawl spaces  or ductwork of air conditioning systems in attics in warm climates 
furnace types  
single-stage  
a single-stage furnace has only one stage of operation  it is either on or off  this means that it is relatively noisy  always running at the highest speed  and always pumping out the hottest air at the highest velocity 
one of the benefits to a single-stage furnace is typically the cost for installation  single-stage furnaces are relatively inexpensive since the technology is rather simple 
two-stage  
this type has two stages of operation  full speed and half  or reduced  speed  depending on the demanded heat  they can run at a lower speed most of the time  they can be quieter  move the air at less velocity  and will better keep the desired temperature in the house 
modulating  
this type of furnace can modulate the heat output and air velocity nearly continuously  depending on the demanded heat and outside temperature  this means that it only works as much as necessary and therefore saves energy 
possible failures  
the following rare but difficult-to-diagnose failure can occur  if the temperature inside the furnace exceeds a maximum threshold  a safety mechanism with a
will shut the furnace down  a symptom of this failure is that the furnace repeatedly shuts down before the house reaches the desired temperature  this is commonly referred to as the furnace  riding the high limit switch   this condition commonly occurs if the temperature setting of the high limit thermostat is set too close to the normal
of the furnace  another situation may occur if a humidifier is incorrectly installed on the furnace and the duct which directs a portion of the humidified air back into the furnace is too large  the solution is to reduce the diameter of the cross-feed tube  or install a baffle that reduces the volume of re-fed air

industrial process furnaces  
schematic diagram of an industrial process furnace
an industrial furnace or direct fired heater  is an equipment used to provide heat for a process or can serve as
which provides heats of reaction  furnace designs vary as to its function  heating duty  type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air  however  most process furnaces have some common features 
fuel flows into the
and is burnt with air provided from an air blower  there can be more than one burner in a particular furnace which can be arranged in cells which heat a particular set of tubes  burners can also be floor mounted  wall mounted or roof mounted depending on design  the flames heat up the tubes  which in turn heat the fluid inside in the first part of the furnace known as the radiant section or   in this chamber where combustion takes place  the heat is transferred mainly by
to tubes around the
in the chamber  the
passes through the tubes and is thus heated to the desired temperature  the gases from the combustion are known as   after the flue gas leaves the firebox  most furnace designs include a
section where more heat is recovered before venting to the
through the    htf heat transfer fluid  industries commonly use their furnaces to heat a secondary fluid with special additives like anti- and high heat transfer efficiency  this heated fluid is then circulated round the whole plant to heat exchangers to be used wherever heat is needed instead of directly heating the product line as the product or material may be volatile or prone to
at the furnace temperature  
radiant section  
middle of radiant section
the radiant section is where the tubes receive almost all its heat by
from the flame  in a vertical  cylindrical furnace  the tubes are vertical  tubes can be vertical or horizontal  placed along the
wall  in the middle  etc   or arranged in cells  studs are used to hold the
together and on the wall of the furnace  they are placed about 1ft  300mm  apart in this picture of the inside of a furnace  the tubes  shown below  which are reddish brown from   are
tubes and run the height of the radiant section  the tubes are a distance away from the insulation so radiation can be reflected to the back of the tubes to maintain a uniform tube wall temperature  tube guides at the top  middle and bottom hold the tubes in place 
convection section  
convection section
the convection section is located above the radiant section where it is cooler to recover additional heat 
takes place by
here  and the tubes are finned to increase heat transfer  the first two tube rows in the bottom of the convection section and at the top of the radiant section is an area of bare tubes  without fins  and are known as the shield section   shock tubes    so named because they are still exposed to plenty of radiation from the firebox and they also act to shield the convection section tubes  which are normally of less resistant material from the high temperatures in the firebox  the area of the radiant section just before flue gas enters the shield section and into the convection section called the bridgezone  a crossover is the tube that connects from the convection section outlet to the radiant section inlet  the crossover piping is normally located outside so that the temperature can be monitored and the efficiency of the convection section can be calculated  the sightglass at the top allows personnel to see the flame shape and pattern from above and visually inspect if flame impingement is occurring  flame impingement happens when the flame touches the tubes and causes small isolated spots of very high temperature 
radiant coil  
this is a series of tubes horizontal  vertical hairpin type connected at ends  with 180 bends  or helical in construction  the radiant coil absorbs heat through radiation  they can be single pass or multi pass depending upon the process-side pressure drop allowed  the radiant coils and bends are housed in the radiant box  radiant coil materials vary from carbon steel for low temperature services to high alloy steels for high temperature services  these are supported from the radiant side walls or hanging from the radiant roof  material of these supports is generally high alloy steel  while designing the radiant coil  care is taken so that provision for expansion  in hot conditions  is kept 
burner  
furnace burner
the burner in the vertical  cylindrical furnace as above  is located in the floor and fires upward  some furnaces have side fired burners  such as in train   the burner
is made of high temperature refractory and is where the flame is contained  air registers located below the burner and at the outlet of the air blower are devices with movable flaps or vanes that control the shape and pattern of the flame  whether it spreads out or even swirls around  flames should not spread out too much  as this will cause flame impingement  air registers can be classified as primary  secondary and if applicable  tertiary  depending on when their air is introduced  the primary air register supplies primary air  which is the first to be introduced in the burner  secondary air is added to supplement primary air  burners may include a pre-mixer to mix the air and fuel for better combustion before introducing into the burner  some burners even use steam as premix to preheat the air and create better mixing of the fuel and heated air  the floor of the furnace is mostly made of a different material from that of the wall  typically hard castable refractory to allow technicians to walk on its floor during maintenance 
a furnace can be lit by a small
or in some older models  by hand  most pilot flames nowadays are lit by an ignition transformer  much like a car s spark plugs   the pilot flame in turn lights up the main flame  the pilot flame uses natural gas while the main flame can use both
and natural gas  when using liquid fuels  an atomizer is used  otherwise  the liquid fuel will simply pour onto the furnace floor and become a hazard  using a pilot flame for lighting the furnace increases safety and ease compared to using a manual ignition method  like a match  
sootblower  
sootblowers are found in the convection section  as this section is above the radiant section and air movement is slower because of the fins 
tends to accumulate here  sootblowing is normally done when the efficiency of the convection section is decreased  this can be calculated by looking at the temperature change from the crossover piping and at the convection section exit 
sootblowers utilize flowing media such as water  air or steam to remove deposits from the tubes  this is typically done during maintenance with the air blower turned on  there are several different types of sootblowers used  wall blowers of the rotary type are mounted on furnace walls protruding between the convection tubes  the
are connected to a steam source with holes drilled into it at intervals along its length  when it is turned on  it rotates and blows the soot off the tubes and out through the stack 
stack  
stack damper
the
is a cylindrical structure at the top of all the heat transfer chambers  the
directly below it collects the flue gas and brings it up high into the atmosphere where it will not endanger personnel 
the stack
contained within works like a
and regulates
 pressure difference between air intake and air exit  in the furnace  which is what pulls the flue gas through the convection section  the stack damper also regulates the heat lost through the stack  as the damper closes  the amount of heat escaping the furnace through the stack decreases  but the
or draft in the furnace increases which poses risks to those working around it if there are air leakages in the furnace  the flames can then escape out of the firebox or even explode if the pressure is too great 
insulation  
insulation is an important part of the furnace because it improves efficiency by minimizing heat escape from the heated chamber  refractory materials such as   castable refractories and   are used for insulation  the floor of the furnace are normally castable type refractories while those on the walls are nailed or glued in place  ceramic fibre is commonly used for the roof and wall of the furnace and is graded by its
and then its maximum temperature rating  for example  8  2,300f means 8lb ft3 density with a maximum temperature rating of 2,300f  the actual service temperature rating for ceramic fiber is a bit lower than the maximum rated temperature   i e  2300f is only good to 2145f before permanent linear shrinkage  
foundations  
concrete pillars are foundation on which the heater is mounted  they can be four nos  for smaller heaters and may be up to 24 nos  for large size heaters  design of pillars and entire foundation is done based on the load bearing capacity of soil and seismic conditions prevailing in the area  foundation bolts are grouted in foundation after installation of the heater 
access doors  
the heater body is provided with access doors at various locations  access doors are to be used only during shutdown of heater  the normal size of the access door is 600x400 mm  which is sufficient for movement of men  material into and out of the heater  during operation the access doors are properly bolted using leak proof high temperature gaskets
