thomas alva edison  february 11  1847  october 18  1931  was an american inventor and businessman  he developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world  including the   the   and the long-lasting  practical electric   dubbed  the wizard of menlo park   he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of
and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention  and because of that  he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial  
edison was a   holding 1,093   as well as many patents in the united kingdom  france  and germany  more significant than the number of edison s patents was the widespread impact of his inventions 
and power     and
all established major new industries worldwide  edison s inventions contributed to
and  in particular  telecommunications  these included a   a   a
for an   electrical power  recorded music and  
his advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a
operator  edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution to homes  businesses  and factories  a crucial development in the modern industrialized world  his first
was on pearl street in   new york  he has been described as americas greatest inventor

early life
edison as a boy
thomas edison was born in     and grew up in     he was the seventh and last child of samuel ogden edison  jr   18041896  born in   and nancy matthews elliott  18101871  born in    his father  the son of a
refugee  had moved as a boy with the family from nova scotia  settling in
 then called    in a village known as shewsbury  later   by 1811  samuel jr  eventually fled ontario because he took part in the unsuccessful
of 1837  his father  samuel sr   had earlier fought in the
as captain of the first middlesex regiment  by contrast  samuel jr  s struggle found him on the losing side  and he crossed into the united states at -port huron  once across the border  he found his way to milan  ohio  his patrilineal family line was dutch by way of new jersey  the surname had originally been  edeson  
his mother taught him at home  much of his education came from reading r g  parker s
and  
edison developed hearing problems at an early age  the cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of
during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections  around the middle of his career  edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in   along with his apparatus and chemicals  in his later years  he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor  in helping him onto a moving train  lifted him by the ears 
edison s family moved to   after the railroad bypassed milan in 1854 and business declined  edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from port huron to detroit  and sold vegetables to supplement his income  he also studied qualitative analysis  and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident prohibited further work of the kind 
edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road  and  with the aid of four assistants  he set in type and printed the grand trunk herald  which he sold with his other papers  this began edison s long streak of entrepreneurial ventures  as he discovered his talents as a businessman  these talents eventually led him to found 14 companies  including   which is still one of the largest
in the world 
telegrapher
edison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old jimmie mackenzie from being struck by a runaway train  jimmie s father 
j u  mackenzie of   was so grateful that he trained edison as a telegraph operator  edison s first telegraphy job away from port huron was at stratford junction    on the  
in 1866  at the age of 19  edison moved to   where  as an employee of   he worked the
bureau   edison requested the night shift  which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimesreading and experimenting  eventually  the latter pre-occupation cost him his job  one night in 1867  he was working with a
when he spilled
onto the floor  it ran between the floorboards and onto his boss s desk below  the next morning edison was fired 
one of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named   who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his   home  some of edison s earliest inventions were related to telegraphy  including a stock ticker  his first patent was for the electric vote recorder   u s  patent 90,646   which was granted on june 1  1869 
marriages and children
on december 25  1871  edison married 16-year-old mary stilwell  18551884   whom he had met two months earlier  she was an employee at one of his shops  they had three children 
marion estelle edison  18731965   nicknamed  dot 
thomas alva edison  jr   18761935   nicknamed  dash 
william leslie edison  18781937  inventor  graduate of the sheffield scientific school at yale  1900 
mary edison died at age 29 on august 9  1884  of unknown causes  possibly from a
or a   doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes  and researchers believe that some of her symptoms sounded as if they were associated with morphine poisoning 
mina miller edison in 1906
on february 24  1886  at the age of thirty-nine  edison married the 20-year-old mina miller  18651947  in   she was the daughter of the inventor   co-founder of the
and a benefactor of
charities  they also had three children together 
madeleine edison  18881979   who married  
 18901969  
 1941  1944   who took over his father s company and experimental laboratories upon his father s death 
 18981992    mit physics 1923   credited with more than 80 patents

edison began his career as an inventor in   with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices  but the invention that first gained him notice was the
in 1877  this accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical  edison became known as  the wizard of menlo park   new jersey 
his first phonograph recorded on
around a grooved cylinder  despite its limited
and that the recordings could be played only a few times  the phonograph made edison a celebrity  joseph henry  president of the national academy of sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the us  described edison as  the most ingenious inventor in this country    or in any other   in april 1878  edison travelled to washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the national academy of sciences  congressmen  senators and us president hayes  the
described edison as a    and his presentation as  a scene    that will live in history   although edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878  he did little to develop it until     and
produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders 
menlo park
edison s menlo park laboratory  reconstructed at greenfield village at
in dearborn  michigan   note the organ against the back wall 
edison s major innovation was the first industrial research lab  which was built in   a part of raritan township 
 today named
in his honor   it was built with the funds from the sale of edison s   after his demonstration of the telegraph  edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for  4,000 to  5,000 was right  so he asked western union to make a bid  he was surprised to hear them offer  10,000   209,500 in today s dollars    which he gratefully accepted  the quadruplex telegraph was edison s first big financial success  and menlo park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement  edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there  though many employees carried out research and development under his direction  his staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research  and he drove them hard to produce results 
  a consulting electrical engineer  began his duties as a laboratory assistant to edison in december 1879  he assisted in experiments on the telephone  phonograph  electric railway      and other developing inventions  however  hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device  see    in 1880  he was appointed chief engineer of the edison lamp works  in his first year  the plant under general manager
turned out 50,000 lamps  according to edison  hammer was  a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting     a competent mathematician and former   was recruited by
and joined the edison organization in 1883  one of sprague s contributions to the edison laboratory at menlo park was to expand edison s mathematical methods  despite the common belief that edison did not use mathematics  analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as francis robbins upton  for example  determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of  
and economics 
nearly all of edison s patents were utility patents  which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical  mechanical  or chemical in nature  about a dozen were   which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period  as in most patents  the inventions he described were improvements over   the phonograph patent  in contrast  was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds 
in just over a decade  edison s menlo park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks  edison said he wanted the lab to have  a stock of almost every conceivable material   a newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim  stating the lab contained  eight thousand kinds of chemicals  every kind of screw made  every size of needle  every kind of cord or wire  hair of humans  horses  hogs  cows  rabbits  goats  minx  camels    silk in every texture  cocoons  various kinds of hoofs  shark s teeth  deer horns  tortoise shell    cork  resin  varnish and oil  ostrich feathers  a peacock s tail  jet  amber  rubber  all ores     and the list goes on 
over his desk  edison displayed a placard with   famous quotation   there is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking   this slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility 
with menlo park  edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application 
carbon telephone transmitter
in 187778  edison invented and developed the
used in all telephones along with the bell receiver until the 1980s  after protracted patent litigation  in 1892 a federal court ruled that edison and not
was the inventor of the carbon microphone  the carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s   
electric light
main article 
thomas edison s first successful light bulb model  used in public demonstration at menlo park  december 1879
in 1878 edison began working on a system of electrical illumination  something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting  he began by tackling the problem of creating a long lasting incandescent lamp  something that would be needed for indoor use  many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps  including  s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by
and   others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included        
and   some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life  high expense to produce  and high
drawn  making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially  217218 edison realized that in order to keep the thickness of the copper wire needed to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size he would have to come up with a lamp that would draw a low amount of current  this meant the lamp would have to have a high
and run at a relatively low voltage  around 110 volts  
after many experiments  first with
filaments and then with
and other metals  in the end edison returned to a carbon filament  the first successful test was on october 22  1879  186 it lasted 13.5 hours  edison continued to improve this design and by november 4  1879  filed for u s  patent 223,898  granted on january 27  1880  for an electric lamp using  a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires   this was the first commercially practical incandescent light 
although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including  cotton and linen thread  wood splints  papers coiled in various ways   it was not until several months after the patent was granted that edison and his team discovered a
filament that could last over 1,200hours  the idea of using this particular raw material originated from edison s recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of battle lake in the present-day state of   where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on july 29  1878  from the  
u s  patent 223898  electric-lamp  issued january 27  1880 
in 1878  edison formed the
in new york city with several financiers  including     and the members of the   edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on december 31  1879  in menlo park  it was during this time that he said   we will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles  
the  s new steamship  the   was the first commercial application for edison s incandescent light bulb in 1880 
  president of the   had attended edison s 1879 demonstration  villard quickly became impressed and requested edison install his electric lighting system aboard his company s new steamer  the   although hesitant at first  edison relented and agreed to villard s request  following most of its completion in may 1880  the columbia was sent to   where edison and his personnel installed columbia s new lighting system  due to this  the columbia became edison s first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb  the edison equipment was eventually removed from columbia in 1895 
joined the edison electric light company in 1884  latimer had received a patent in january 1881 for the  process of manufacturing carbons   an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for lightbulbs  latimer worked as an engineer  a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights 
 s company bought
competing
patent rights  1882  for  25,000  forcing the holders of the edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp 
on october 8  1883  the
ruled that edison s patent was based on the work of
and was therefore invalid  litigation continued for nearly six years  until october 6  1889  when a judge ruled that edison s electric-light improvement claim for  a filament of carbon of high resistance  was valid  to avoid a possible court battle with joseph swan  whose british patent had been awarded a year before edison s  he and swan formed a joint company called
to manufacture and market the invention in britain 
in
 in what is now the czech republic   which opened in 1882  was the first public building in the world to use edison s electric lamps  with the installation supervised by edison s assistant in the invention of the lamp    in september 2010  a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in brno  in front of the theatre 
electric power distribution
after devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on october 21  1879  edison went on to develop an electric    designed to compete with the then existent gas lighting utilities  on december 17  1880  he founded the
and during the 1880s he patented a system for   the company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on   new york city  it was on september 4  1882  that edison switched on his
generating station s electrical power distribution system  which provided 110 volts
 dc  to 59 customers in lower  
earlier in the year  in january 1882  he had switched on the first steam-generating power station at
in london  the dc supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station  on january 19  1883  the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing
began service in  
war of currents
main article 
extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events  as in this picture from the 1897  
as edison was expanding his
 dc  power delivery system he began receiving stiff competition from companies installing
 ac  systems  from the early 1880s on ac
systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the us  with the development of
in europe and by
in the us in 1885-1886 it became possible to transmit ac very long distances over thinner and cheaper wires  and  step down  the voltage at the destination for distribution to users  this allowed ac to be used not only in street lighting but also in lighting for small business and domestic customers  the market edison s patented low voltage dc incandescent lamp system had been designed to supply  edison s dc empire began suffering from one of its chief drawbacks  it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities  edison s dc plants could not deliver electricity to customers who were more than one mile from the plant and the short range left a patchwork of un-supplied customers in-between plants  small cities and rural areas could not afford an edison style system at all  this left a large part of market without electrical service and ac companies were expanding into this gap 
edison expressed views that ac was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous  as
was installing his first ac systems in 1886  thomas edison began a pattern of striking out personally against his chief rival stating   just as certain as death  westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size  he has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically   many reasons have been put forward for edison s anti-ac stance  one notion is that the inventor may not have been able to grasp the more abstract theories behind ac and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand  edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from some competitor s misinstalled ac system killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general  on top of all that was the simple fact that edison electric had based their entire design on low voltage dc and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was  in edison s mind  out of the question  by the end of 1887 edison electric was beginning to lose market share with westinghouse  who had built 68 ac-based power stations to edison s 121 dc-based stations  to make matters worse for edison  the
of lynn  massachusetts  another ac-based competitor  had built 22 power stations 
parallel to the expanding competition between edison and the ac companies was a rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines that turned into a media frenzy against the current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it  edison took advantage of the public perception that ac was dangerous and teamed up with the self-styled new york anti-ac crusader
in a
campaign  aiding brown in the public electrocution of animals with ac as well as supported legislation to control and severely limit ac installations and voltages  to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system  in what was now being referred to as a   the development of the
was used in an attempt to portray ac as having a greater lethal potential than dc and
westinghouse at the same time via edison colluding with brown and westinghouse s chief ac rival  the thomson-houston electric company  to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a westinghouse ac generator 
thomas edison s staunch anti-ac tactics were not sitting well with his own stock holders  by the early 1890s edison s company was generating much smaller profits than its ac rivals  and the war of currents would come to an end in 1892 with edison being forced out of controlling his own company  that year the financier
engineered a merger of edison general electric with thomson-houston that basically put the board of thomson-houston in charge of the new company called
 dropping  edison  from its name   general electric now controlled three quarters of the us electrical business and would go on to compete with westinghouse for the ac market 
other inventions and projects
fluoroscopy
edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available   a machine that uses
to take   until edison discovered that
fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium
screens originally used by   the technology was capable of producing only very faint images 
the fundamental design of edison s fluoroscope is still in use today  although edison himself abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant    dally had made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and in the process been exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation  he later died of injuries related to the exposure  in 1903  a shaken edison said  don t talk to me about x-rays  i am afraid of them  
telegraph improvements
the key to edison s fortunes was telegraphy  with knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator  he learned the basics of electricity  this allowed him to make his early fortune with the   the first electricity-based broadcast system  on august 9  1892  edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph 
motion pictures
the june 1894 leonardcushing bout  each of the six one-minute rounds recorded by the kinetoscope was made available to exhibitors for  22.50  customers who watched the final round saw leonard score a knockdown 
edison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or  kinetograph   he did the electromechanical design  while his employee   a photographer  worked on the photographic and optical development  much of the credit for the invention belongs to dickson  in 1891  thomas edison built a   or peep-hole viewer  this device was installed in penny arcades  where people could watch short  simple films  the kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited may 20  1891 
in april 1896   s   manufactured by the edison factory and marketed in edison s name  was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in new york city  later he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings  mechanically synchronized with the film 
officially the kinetoscope entered europe when the rich american businessman
 18691948  bought from the continental commerce company of frank z  maguire and joseph d  baucus a dozen machines  bush placed from october 17  1894  the first kinetoscopes in london  at the same time the french company kintoscope edison michel et alexis werner bought these machines for the market in france  in the last three months of 1894  the continental commerce company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in europe  i e  the netherlands and italy   in germany and in
the kinetoscope was introduced by the deutsche-sterreichische-edison-kinetoscop gesellschaft  founded by the ludwig stollwerck of the schokoladen-ssswarenfabrik stollwerck   co of cologne 
the first kinetoscopes arrived in belgium at the
in early 1895  the edison s kintoscope franais  a belgian company  was founded in brussels on january 15  1895  with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in monaco  france and the french colonies  the main investors in this company were belgian industrialists 
on may 14  1895  the edison s kintoscope belge was founded in brussels  the businessman ladislas-victor lewitzki  living in london but active in belgium and france  took the initiative in starting this business  he had contacts with
and the
co  in 1898 he also became a shareholder of the biograph and mutoscope company for france 
made close to 1,200 films  the majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as
 1894  
 1896  
 1903  
 1910   and the first
film in 1910  in 1903  when the owners of
announced they would execute
by strangulation  poisoning  and electrocution  with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant   edison manufacturing sent a crew to film it  releasing it that same year with the title  
a day with thomas edison  1922 
as the film business expanded competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other s films  to better protect the copyrights on his films  edison deposited prints of them on long strips of
with the   many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era 
in 1908  edison started the   which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios  commonly known as the edison trust   thomas edison was the first honorary fellow of the   which was founded in 1929 
edison said his favorite movie was   he thought that
had  spoiled everything  for him   there isn t any good acting on the screen  they concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act  i can sense it more than you because i am deaf   his favorite stars were
and  
mining
starting in the late 1870s  thomas edison became interested and involved with mining  there was a scarcity of high-grade iron ore on the east coast of the united states and so edison instead tried to mine low-grade ore  edison would go on to develop a number of rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons  the dust would then be sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust  despite the failure of his mining company  the   edison would go on to use some of the materials and equipment to begin producing cement 
in 1901  edison visited an industrial exhibition in the
area in ontario  canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment  he returned as a mining prospector  and is credited with the original discovery of the
ore body  his attempts to mine the ore body were not successful  however  and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903  a street in falconbridge  as well as the   which served as the head office of   are named for him 
rubber
from left to right  henry ford  thomas edison  and harvey firestone  the three partners of the edison botanic research corporation 
edison became concerned with america s reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber  he partnered with harvey firestone and
 all three contributing  25,000 each  to create the edison botanic research corp  in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in fort myers  florida the following year  edison did the majority of the research and planting  sending results and sample rubber residues to his west orange lab  edison employed a two-part   to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder  after testing 17,000 plant samples  he eventually found an adequate source in the goldenrod plant

edison moved from menlo park after the death of his first wife  mary  in 1884  and purchased a home known as    in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife  mina  in
in   in 1885  thomas edison had bought property in   florida  and built what was later called
as a winter retreat  edison and mina spent many winters at their home in fort myers  and edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber 
edison s work on rubber took place largely at his botanic research laboratory in fort myers  which has now been designated as a national historic chemical landmark  the laboratory was built after thomas edison  henry ford  and harvey firestone pulled together  75,000 to form the edison botanical research corporation  initially  only ford and firestone were to contributed monetary funds to the project while edison did all the research  edison  however  wished to contribute  25,000 as well  after testing over 17,000 plant species  edison decided on solidago leavenworthii  also known as leavenworth s goldenrod  the plant  which normally grows roughly 34 feet tall with a 5  latex yield was adapted by edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12   in october 1931  edison reported that he was close to finding a domestic source of rubber but died in the same month  his brother-in-law  john miller  would take over management of the project until it was shuttered in 1936   
final years
  thomas edison  and   respectively    florida  february 11  1929
  the automobile magnate  later lived a few hundred feet away from edison at his winter retreat in fort myers  ford once worked as an engineer for the edison illuminating company of detroit and met edison at a convention of affiliated edison illuminating companies in brooklyn  ny in 1896  edison was impressed with fords internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments  they were friends until edison s death  edison and ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924  harvey firestone and john burroughs also participated 
in 1928  edison joined the fort myers   he believed strongly in the organization  writing that  the civitan club is doing thingsbig thingsfor the community  state  and nation  and i certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks   he was an active member in the club until his death  sometimes bringing henry ford to the club s meetings 
edison was active in business right up to the end  just months before his death  the
inaugurated suburban electric train service from
to     and   electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current  which edison had championed  despite his frail condition  edison was at the throttle of the first electric mu  multiple-unit  train to depart lackawanna terminal in hoboken in september 1930  driving the train the first mile through hoboken yard on its way to  
this fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern new jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984  a plaque commemorating edison s inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of lackawanna terminal in hoboken  which is presently operated by  
edison was said to have been influenced by a popular
in his last few years   the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours   he is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health  however  this tale is doubtful  in 1930  the year before edison died  mina said in an interview about him   correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies   she also said that during one of his periodic  great scientific adventures   edison would be up at 7 00  have breakfast at 8 00  and be rarely home for lunch or dinner  implying that he continued to have all three 
edison became the owner of his   birthplace in 1906  on his last visit  in 1923  he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles   
death
edison died of complications of diabetes on october 18  1931  in his home   glenmont  in
in   which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for mina  he is buried behind the home 
edison s last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at the   ford reportedly convinced
to seal a test tube of air in the inventor s room shortly after his death  as a memento  a plaster
was also made  mina died in 1947 
views on politics  religion and metaphysics
historian paul israel has characterized edison as a     edison was heavily influenced by  s   edison defended paine s  scientific    saying   he has been called an   but atheist he was not  paine believed in a supreme intelligence  as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity   in an october 2  1910  interview in the   edison stated 
nature is what we know  we do not know the gods of religions  and nature is not kind  or merciful  or loving  if god made me the fabled god of the three qualities of which i spoke  mercy  kindness  love he also made the fish i catch and eat  and where do his mercy  kindness  and love for that fish come in  no  nature made us nature did it all not the gods of the religions 
edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks  and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly  he clarified himself in a private letter 
you have misunderstood the whole article  because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of god  there is no such denial  what you call god i call nature  the supreme intelligence that rules matter  all the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came  scattered amongst the cells of which we are made 
he also stated   i do not believe in the god of the theologians  but that there is a supreme intelligence i do not doubt  
was key to edison s moral views  and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for world war i  he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted   i am proud of the fact that i never invented weapons to kill   edison s philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well  about which he stated   nonviolence leads to the highest ethics  which is the goal of all evolution  until we stop harming all other living beings  we are still savages   he was a
but not a
in actual practice  at least near the end of his life 
in 1920  edison set off a media sensation when he told
of
that he was working on a  spirit phone  to allow communication with the dead  a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated  edison later disclaimed the idea  telling the new york times in 1926 that  i really had nothing to tell him  but i hated to disappoint him so i thought up this story about communicating with spirits  but it was all a joke  
views on money
thomas edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the united states  he was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money  famously  he was quoted in the new york times stating  gold is a relic of julius caesar  and
is an invention of satan  
in the same article  he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the united states  in need of a loan  be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal  or even greater sums  due to interest  his basic point was that if the government can produce debt-based money  it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer 
he thought at length about the subject of money over 1921 and 1922  in may 1922  he published a proposal  entitled  a proposed amendment to the federal reserve banking system   in it  he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency  in which the federal reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers  based on the value of commodities they produced  during a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor    he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform  for insight  he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals  in the end  however  edison s proposals failed to find support  and were eventually abandoned
