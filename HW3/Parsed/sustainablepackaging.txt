sustainable packaging is the development and use of
which results in improved   this involves increased use of life cycle inventory  lci  and
 lca  to help guide the use of packaging which reduces the
and   it includes a look at the whole of the supply chain  from basic function  to marketing  and then through to end of life  lca  and rebirth  additionally  an eco-cost to value ratio can be useful the goals are to improve the long term viability and quality of life for
and the longevity of natural ecosystems  sustainable packaging must meet the functional and economic needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs  sustainability is not necessarily an end state but is a continuing process of improvement 
sustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations for packaging  see    it requires more analysis and documentation to look at the package design  choice of materials  processing  and life-cycle  this is not just the vague  green movement  that many businesses and companies have been trying to include over the past years  companies implementing these eco-friendly actions are reducing their   using more recycled materials and reusing more package components  they often encourage suppliers  contract packagers  and distributors to do likewise 
for example  researchers at the
are looking into using dairy-based films as an alternative to petroleum-based packaging 
instead of being made of   these dairy-based films would be composed of proteins such as
and   which are found in milk  the films would be
and offer better oxygen barriers than synthetic  chemical-based films  more research must be done to improve the water barrier quality of the dairy-based film  but advances in sustainable packaging are actively being pursued 
claims on packages need to be made  and read  with caution  ambiguous
titles such as green packaging and environmentally friendly can be confusing without specific definition  some regulators  such as the us federal trade commission  are providing guidance to packagers
companies have long been reusing and recycling packaging when economically viable  using minimal packaging has also been a common goal to help reduce costs  recent years have accelerated these efforts based on social movements  consumer pressure  and regulation  all phases of packaging  distribution  and logistics are included 
sustainable packaging is no longer focused on just recycling  just as packaging is not the only eco target  although it is still top of mind for many  right or wrong  packaging is frequently scrutinized and used as the measure of a company s overall sustainability  even though it may contribute only a small percentage to the total eco impact compared to other things  such as transportation  and water and energy use

criteria  
the criteria for ranking and comparing packaging based on their sustainability is an active area of development  general guidance  metrics  checklists  and scorecards are being published by several groups 
government    consumers  retailers  and packagers are considering several types of criteria 
each organization words the goals and targets a little differently  in general  the broad goals of sustainable packaging are 
functional  product protection  safety  regulatory compliance  etc 
cost effective  if it is too expensive  it is unlikely to be used
support long-term human and ecological health
specific factors for
of packaging may include 
use of minimal materials  reduced packaging  reduced layers of packaging  lower mass  product to packaging ratio   lower volume  etc 
efficiency  through complete life cycle   cube utilization  tare weight  enablement of efficient transportation  etc  
efficiency  total energy content and usage  use of   etc 
content  as available and functional  for   there are special safety considerations  particularly for use of recycled plastics and paper  regulations are published by each country or region 
recyclability  recovery value  use of materials which are frequently and easily   reduction of materials which hinder recyclability of major components  etc 
 repeated
of package  reuse for other purposes  etc 
use of
in packaging
use of
and
materials  when appropriate and do not cause contamination of the recycling stream
avoid the use of materials toxic to humans or the environment
effects on atmosphere climate   
  and      etc 
use  reuse  treatment  waste  etc 
worker impact  occupational health  safety  clean technology  etc 
made from materials healthy throughout the life cycle
physically designed to optimize materials and energy
use integral design to reduce the use of materials
follow the requirements of the
the chosen criteria are often used best as a basis of comparison for two or more similar packaging designs  not as an absolute success or failure  such a multi-variable comparison is often presented as a
 spider chart  star chart  etc   
benefits  
some aspects of environmentally sound packaging are required by regulators while others are decisions made by each packager  investors  employees  management  and customers can influence corporate decisions and help set policies  when investors seek to purchase stock  companies known for their positive environmental policy can be attractive  potential stockholders and investors see this as a solid decision  lower environmental risks lead to more capital at cheaper rates  companies that highlight their environmental status to consumers  can boost sales as well as product reputation  going green is often a sound investment that can pay off 
costs  
the process of engineering more environmentally acceptable packages can include consideration of the costs  some companies claim that their environmental packaging program is cost effective  some alternative materials that are recycled recyclable and or less damaging to the environment can lead to companies incurring increased costs  though this is common when any product begins to carry the true cost of its production  producer pays  producer responsibility laws  take-back laws   there may be an expensive and lengthy process before the new forms of packaging are deemed safe to the public  and approval may take up to two years  it is important to note here  that for most of the developed world  tightening legislation  and changes in major retailer demand  walmart s sustainable packaging scorecard for example  the question is no longer  if  products and packaging should become more sustainable  but how-to and how-soon to do it 
criticism  
efforts toward greener packaging are supported in the sustainability community  however  these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end  some picture a true sustainable
that may be very different from today s  greatly reduced energy usage  minimal   fewer  
with   little   etc  less packaging would be needed in this economy  fewer packaging options would exist  simpler packaging forms may be necessary
