embodied energy is the sum of all the energy required to produce any goods or services  considered as if that energy was incorporated or  embodied  in the product itself  the concept can be useful in determining the effectiveness of energy-producing or energy-saving devices  or the  real  replacement cost of a building  and  because energy-inputs usually entail
emissions  in deciding whether a product contributes to or mitigates   one fundamental purpose for measuring this quantity is to compare the amount of energy produced or saved by the product in question to the amount of energy consumed in producing it 
embodied energy is an accounting method which aims to find the sum total of the energy necessary for an entire product life-cycle  determining what constitutes this life-cycle includes assessing the relevance and extent of energy into raw material extraction  transport  manufacture  assembly  installation  disassembly  deconstruction and or decomposition as well as human and secondary resources  different methodologies produce different understandings of the scale and scope of application and the type of energy embodied

history  
the history of constructing a system of accounts which records the energy flows through an environment can be traced back to the origins of
itself  as a distinct method  it is often associated with the  s  substance  theory of value  and later the agricultural energetics of   a ukrainian physician  and the ecological energetics of  
the main methods of embodied energy accounting as they are used today grew out of  s
and are called input-output embodied energy analysis  leontief s input-output model was in turn an adaptation of the
theory of
with application to  the empirical study of the quantitative interdependence between interrelated economic activities   according to tennenbaum leontief s input-output method was adapted to embodied energy analysis by hannon to describe ecosystem energy flows  hannons adaptation tabulated the total direct and indirect energy requirements  the energy intensity  for each output made by the system  the total amount of energies  direct and indirect  for the entire amount of production was called the embodied energy 
embodied energy methodologies  
embodied energy analysis is interested in what energy goes to supporting a consumer  and so all energy depreciation is assigned to the final demand of consumer  different methodologies use different scales of data to calculate energy embodied in products and services of nature and human civilization  international consensus on the appropriateness of data scales and methodologies is pending  this difficulty can give a wide range in embodied energy values for any given material  in the absence of a comprehensive global embodied energy public dynamic database  embodied energy calculations may omit important data on  for example  the rural road highway construction and maintenance needed to move a product  human marketing  advertising  catering services  non-human services and the like  such omissions can be a source of significant methodological error in embodied energy estimations  without an estimation and declaration of the embodied energy error  it is difficult to calibrate the   and so the
of any given material  process or service to environmental and human economic processes 
standards  
the sbtool  uk
and usa leed are methods in which the embodied energy of a product or material is rated  along with other factors  to assess a building s   embodied energy is a concept for which scientists have not yet agreed absolute universal values because there are many variables to take into account  but most agree that products can be compared to each other to see which has more and which has less embodied energy  comparative lists  for an example  see the university of bath embodied energy   carbon material inventory  contain average absolute values  and explain the factors which have been taken into account when compiling the lists 
typical embodied energy units used are mj kg  mega of energy needed to make a kilogram of product   tco2  tonnes of
created by the energy needed to make a kilogram of product   converting mj to tco2 is not straightforward because different types of energy  oil  wind  solar  nuclear and so on  emit different amounts of carbon dioxide  so the actual amount of carbon dioxide emitted when a product is made will be dependent on the type of energy used in the manufacturing process  for example  the australian government gives a global average of 0.098 tco2   1 gj  this is the same as 1 mj   0.098kgco2   98 gco2 or 1kgco2   10.204 mj 
related methodologies  
in the 2000s drought conditions in
have generated interest in the application of embodied energy analysis methods to water  this has led to use of the concept of  
embodied energy in common materials

embodied energy in automobiles  
manufacturing  
according to   the embodied energy contents of a golf a3 with a
amounts to 18 000 kwh  i e  12  of 545 gj as shown in the report   a golf a4  equipped with a   will show an embodied energy amounting to 22 000 kwh  i e  15  of 545 gj as shown in the report   according to the french energy and environment agency ademe
a motor car has an embodied energy contents of 20 800 kwh whereas an
shows an embodied energy contents amounting to 34 700 kwh 
fuel  
as regards energy itself  the factor
 eroei  of fuel can be estimated at 8  which means that to some amount of useful energy provided by fuel should be added 1/7 of that amount in embodied energy of the fuel  in other words  the fuel consumption should be augmented by 14  due to the fuel eroei 
road construction  
we have to work here with figures  which prove still more difficult to obtain  in the case of road construction  the embodied energy would amount to 1/18 of the fuel consumption  i e  6   
overall embodied energy of a car  
the
shows the usual fuel consumption of different means of transportation  if an embodied energy of 20 000 kwh is assumed  when taking a distance of 200 000km into account  10 kwh or one liter of gasoline per 100km has to be added to the consumption  moreover  the eroei and the road construction represent approximately 20  of the fuel consumption  for a consumption of 6,4 l 100km  it means that the corresponding embodied energy is equal to 1.3 l 100km  so that the overall embodied energy amounts to 2.3 l 100km 
other figures available  
treloar  et al  have estimated the embodied energy in an average automobile in australia as 0.27
 i e  75 000 kwh  as one component in an overall analysis of the energy involved in road transportation 
embodied energy in buildings  
although most of the focus for improving energy efficiency in buildings has been on their operational emissions  it is estimated that about 30  of all energy consumed throughout the lifetime of a building can be in its embodied energy  this percentage varies based on factors such as age of building  climate  and materials   in the past  this percentage was much lower  but as much focus has been placed on reducing operational emissions  such as efficiency improvements in heating and cooling systems   the embodied energy contribution has come much more into play  examples of embodied energy include  the energy used to extract raw resources  process materials  assemble product components  transport between each step  construction  maintenance and repair  deconstruction and disposal  as such  it is important to employ a whole-life carbon accounting framework in analyzing the carbon emissions in buildings 
embodied energy in the energy field  
provides a basis for evaluating the embodied energy due to energy 
thanks to eroei definition  it is possible to evaluate the

  displaystyle  eta  
according to

 
eroei  1
eroei
  displaystyle  eta    frac   hbox eroei  1    hbox eroei    
under these circumstances  final energy has to be multiplied by
1
eroei - 1
  displaystyle   frac   hbox 1    hbox eroei - 1    
in order to get  
given an eroei amounting to eight e g   a seventh of the final energy has to be added to the final energy for obtaining primary energy 
not only that  for really obtaining overall embodied energy  embodied energy due to the construction and maintenance of power plants should be taken into account  too  here  figures are badly needed 
in   by convention  eroei related to electricity is equal to 2.58/1.58  i e  1.633
corresponding to an efficiency of 0.3875 or 38.8   moreover  if the grid efficiency is evaluated at 92.5   overall electricity efficiency in france amounts to 35.8  
in   on the contrary  because of the swift development of the renewable energies  the ratio between primary energy and final energy in electricity amounts to only 1.8  leading to an eroei of 1.8/0.8   2.25 corresponding to an efficiency of 55.5
