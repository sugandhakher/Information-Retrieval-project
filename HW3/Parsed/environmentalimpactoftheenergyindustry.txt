and climate change  in most parts of the world little change is being made to slow these changes  if the
theory proves true  and more explorations of viable alternative energy sources are made  our impact could be less hostile to our environment 
rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation  water and waste management  and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of

with
and some agricultural practices being also major contributors 
although there is a highly publicized   the vast majority of scientists working in
accept that it is due to human activity  the
report climate change 2007  climate change impacts  adaptation and vulnerability predicts that climate change will cause shortages of food and water and increased risk of flooding that will affect billions of people  particularly those living in poverty 
one measurement of greenhouse gas related and other
comparisons between energy sources can be found in the externe project by the
and the
which was funded by the   according to that study 
electricity produces the lowest co2 emissions 
produces the second-lowest 
produces the third-lowest and
produces the fourth-lowest 
similarly  the same research study  externe  externalities of energy   undertaken from 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over its present value  and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30  if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health  from the    
and
emissions produced by these sources  were taken into account  it was estimated in the study that these external  downstream  fossil fuel costs amount up to 1 -2  of the   and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included  the study also found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power  per unit of energy delivered  was 0.0019 kwh  which was found to be lower than that of many
sources including that caused by
and photovoltaic   and was thirty times lower than coal at 0.06 kwh  or 6 cents kwh  with the energy sources of the lowest external environmental and health costs associated with it being
at 0.0009 kwh 
biofuel use

is defined as solid  liquid or gaseous
obtained from relatively recently lifeless or living biological material and is different from   which are derived from long-dead biological material  various
and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacturing

high use of bio-diesel leads to land use changes including  
firewood  
unsustainable
harvesting can lead to loss of

due to loss of forest cover  an example of this is a 40-year study done by the
of african forests  which account for a third of the world s total
which demonstrates that

expert  lee white states that  to get an idea of the value of the sink  the removal of nearly 5 billion tonnes of
from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests is at issue 
according to the
the african continent is losing forest twice as fast as the rest of the world   once upon a time  africa boasted seven million square kilometers of forest but a third of that has been lost  most of it to   
fossil fuel use

that in 2006 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.8   coal 26.6   natural gas 22.9   amounting to an 86  share for fossil fuels in primary energy production in the world 
in 2013 the burning of fossil fuels produced around 32 billion

of the earth to rise in response  which
agree will cause major adverse  
coal  
main article 
the environmental impact of coal mining and burning is diverse  legislation passed by the u s  congress in 1990 required the
 epa  to issue a plan to alleviate toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants  after delay and litigation  the epa now has a court-imposed deadline of march 16  2011  to issue its report 
petroleum

the environmental impact of
is often negative because it is
to almost all forms of life  the possibility of
exists  petroleum  commonly referred to as oil  is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society  especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities 
gas  
is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel  producing less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than either coal or oil   and far fewer pollutants than other fossil fuels  however  in absolute terms it does contribute substantially to global carbon emissions  and this contribution is projected to grow  according to the   in 2004 natural gas produced about 5,300 mt yr of co2 emissions  while coal and oil produced 10,600 and 10,200 respectively  figure 4.4   but by 2030  according to an updated version of the
emissions scenario  natural gas would be the source of 11,000 mt yr  with coal and oil now 8,400 and 17,200 respectively    for 2004 were estimated at over 27,200 mt  
in addition  natural gas itself is a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere but is released in smaller amounts 
electricity generation  
main article 
the environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power  this power is normally
at
that convert some other kind of energy into electrical power  each such system has advantages and disadvantages  but many of them pose environmental concerns 
reservoirs  
main article 
the environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases 
and the
can be used to supply   generate
power  increasing the water supply for   provide recreational opportunities and for flood control  however  adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions  whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimentalto both the environment and surrounding human populations has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that  in 1960 the construction of
and the flooding of
provoked political uproar which continues to this day  more recently  the construction of
and other similar projects throughout  
and
have generated considerable environmental and political debate 
nuclear power  
main article 
nuclear power activities involving the environment  mining  enrichment  generation and geological disposal 
the environmental impact of
results from the   operation  and the effects of  
the routine health risks and
from nuclear fission power are smaller than those associated with coal  oil and gas  however  there is a  catastrophic risk  potential if containment fails  which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by over-heated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment  the most long-lived radioactive wastes  including spent nuclear fuel  must be contained and isolated from humans and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years  the public is sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable  
the 1979
and 1986   along with high construction costs  ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity  a further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 japanese tsunami which damaged the   resulting in
classified as a
event  the large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a 20km exclusion zone set up around the power plant  similar to the 30km radius

wind power  
main article 
grazing near a wind turbine 
the environmental impact of wind power when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels  is relatively minor  according to the   in assessments of the   wind turbines have a
value of between 12 and 11  co2   depending  respectively  on if offshore or onshore turbines are being assessed  compared with other
sources  wind turbines have some of the lowest
per unit of electrical energy generated 
while a wind farm may cover a large area of land  many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with it  as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use 
there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures  the scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant  depending on specific circumstances  prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities  and protection of   affect the siting and operation of wind turbines 
there are anecdotal reports of negative health effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines  peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims 
aesthetic aspects of wind turbines and resulting changes of the visual landscape are significant  conflicts arise especially in scenic and heritage protected landscapes 
mitigation  
energy conservation  
main article 
energy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy consumption  energy conservation can be achieved through increased   in conjunction with decreased
and or reduced consumption from conventional energy sources 
energy conservation can result in increased  
quality      and     individuals and organizations that are direct
of energy choose to conserve energy to reduce energy costs and promote   industrial and commercial users can increase energy use efficiency to maximize  
energy policy  
main article 
energy policy is the manner in which a given entity  often governmental  has decided to address issues of
including  
and   the attributes of energy policy may include   international treaties  incentives to investment  guidelines for  
and other public policy techniques
