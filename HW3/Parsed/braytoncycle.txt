the brayton cycle is a
named after
that describes the workings of a constant pressure   the original brayton engines used a piston compressor and piston expander  but more modern
engines and
also follow the brayton cycle  although the cycle is usually run as an
 and indeed must be run as such if internal combustion is used     it is conventionally assumed for the purposes of
analysis that the exhaust gases are reused in the intake  enabling analysis as a closed system 
the engine cycle is named after
 18301892   the american
who developed it originally for use in piston engines   although it was originally proposed and patented by englishman
in 1791  it is also sometimes known as the
cycle  the
is similar to the brayton cycle but uses external heat and incorporates the use of a regenerator  there are two types of brayton cycles  open to the atmosphere and using internal
or closed and using a heat exchanger

applied for a patent for his  ready motor   a reciprocating constant-pressure engine  the engine was a 2-stroke and produced power on every revolution  brayton engines used a separate piston compressor and piston expander  with compressed air heated by internal fire as it entered the expander cylinder  the first versions of the brayton engine were vapor engines which mixed fuel with air as it entered the compressor by means of a   the fuel   air was contained in a reservoir   tank and then it was admitted to the expansion cylinder and burned  as the fuel   air mixture entered the expansion cylinder it was ignited by a pilot flame  a screen was used to prevent the fire from entering   returning to the reservoir  in early versions of the engine  this screen sometimes failed and an explosion would occur  in 1874 brayton solved the explosion problem by adding the fuel just prior to the expander cylinder  the engine now used heavier fuels such as kerosine and fuel oil  ignition remained pilot flame  brayton produced and sold  ready motors  to perform a variety of tasks like water pumping  mill operation  running generators and marine propulsion  the  ready motors  were produced from 1872 to sometime in the 1880 s  how many of these engines were produced is not known  probably there were several hundred  possibly a thousand  brayton licensed the design to simone in the uk  there were many variations of the layout  some were single-acting and some were double-acting  some had under walking beams  others had overhead walking beams  there were both horizontal and vertical models  sizes ranged from less than one horsepower to over 40 horsepower  critics of the time claimed the engines ran smoothly and had a reasonable efficiency 
brayton cycle engines were some of the first internal combustion engines used for motive power  in 1875 john holland used a brayton engine to power the world s first self-propelled submarine  holland boat  1   in 1879 a brayton engine was used to power a second submarine  the    s submarines are preserved in the
in the
of  
george b selden driving a brayton powered automobile in 1905
in 1878 
patented the first internal combustion automobile  inspired by the
invented by
displayed at the
in philadelphia in 1876  selden patented a 4 wheel car working on a smaller lighter multi-cylinder version  he then filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process resulting in a delay of 16 years before the patent was granted on november 5  1895  in 1903 selden sued ford for patent infringement and
fought the selden patent until 1911  selden had never actually produced a working car  so during the trial 2 machines were constructed according to the patent drawings  ford argued his cars used the four-stroke
cycle or
and not the brayton cycle engine used in the selden auto  ford won the appeal of the original case 
in 1887 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke direct injection oil engine  us patent  432,114 of 1890  application filed in 1887  the fuel system used a variable quantity pump and liquid fuel high pressure spray type injection  the liquid was forced through a spring loaded relief type valve  injector  which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets  injection was timed to occur at or near the peak of the compression stroke  a platinum igniter or ignitor provided the source of ignition  brayton describes the invention as follows  i have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder  or in a communicating firing chamber  another part reads i have for the first time  so far as my knowledge extends  regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion  this was likely the first engine to use a lean-burn system to regulate engine speed   output  in this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed   output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected 
in 1890 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke air blast oil engine  us patent  432,260  the fuel system delivered a variable quantity of vaporized fuel to the center of the cylinder under pressure at or near the peak of the compression stroke  the ignition source was an igniter made from platinum wire  a variable quantity injection pump provided the fuel to an injector where it was mixed with air as it entered the cylinder  a small crank driven compressor provided the source for air  this engine also used the lean burn system 
diesel originally proposed a very high compression constant temperature cycle where the heat of compression would exceed the heat of combustion  however after several years of experiments it was realized that the constant temperature cycle would not work in a piston engine  early diesel engines use an air blast system which was pioneered by brayton in 1890  consequently these early engines use the constant pressure cycle 
just like steam turbines were adopted from steam piston engine so were gas turbines adopted from early piston constant pressure engines

a brayton-type
consists of three components 
a
a mixing chamber
an
modern brayton engines are almost always a turbine type although brayton only made piston engines  in the original 19th-century brayton engine  ambient air is drawn into a piston compressor  where it is   ideally an   the compressed air then runs through a mixing chamber where fuel is added  an   the pressurized air and fuel mixture is then ignited in an expansion cylinder and energy is released  causing the heated air and combustion products to expand through a piston cylinder  another ideally isentropic process  some of the work extracted by the piston cylinder is used to drive the compressor through a crankshaft arrangement 
gas turbines are also brayton engines  this also has three components 
a gas compressor
a burner  or
chamber 
an
ideal brayton cycle 
 ambient air is drawn into the compressor  where it is pressurized 
 the compressed air then runs through a combustion chamber  where fuel is burned  heating that aira constant-pressure process  since the chamber is open to flow in and out 
isentropic process  the heated  pressurized air then gives up its energy  expanding through a turbine  or series of turbines   some of the work extracted by the turbine is used to drive the compressor 
isobaric process  heat rejection  in the atmosphere

idealized brayton cycle
since neither the compression nor the expansion can be truly isentropic  losses through the compressor and the expander represent sources of inescapable working   in general  increasing the
is the most direct way to increase the overall
output of a brayton system

figure1  brayton cycle efficiency
figure2  brayton cycle specific power output
the highest temperature in the cycle occurs at the end of the combustion process  and it is limited by the maximum temperature that the turbine blades can withstand  this also limits the pressure ratios that can be used in the cycle  for a fixed turbine inlet temperature  the net work output per cycle increases with the pressure ratio  thus the thermal efficiency  and the net work output  with less work output per cycle  a larger mass flow rate  thus a larger system  is needed to maintain the same power output  which may not be economical  in most common designs  the pressure ratio of a gas turbine ranges from about 11 to 16 
methods to increase power  
the power output of a brayton engine can be improved in the following manners 
reheat  wherein the in most cases airexpands through a series of turbines  then is passed through a second combustion chamber before expanding to ambient pressure through a final set of turbines  this has the advantage of increasing the power output possible for a given compression ratio without exceeding any
constraints  typically about 1000c   the use of an
for jet aircraft engines can also be referred to as  reheat   it is a different process in that the reheated air is expanded through a thrust nozzle rather than a turbine  the metallurgical constraints are somewhat alleviated  enabling much higher reheat temperatures  about 2000c   reheat is most often used to improve the specific power  per throughput of air   and is usually associated with a drop in efficiency  this effect is especially pronounced in afterburners due to the extreme amounts of extra fuel used 
overspray  wherein  after a first compressor stage  water is injected into the compressor  thus increasing the mass-flow inside the compressor  increasing the turbine output power significantly and reducing compressor outlet temperatures  in a second compressor stage the water is completely converted to a gas form  offering some intercooling via its latent heat of vaporization 
methods to improve efficiency  
the efficiency of a brayton engine can be improved in the following manners 
increasing pressure ratio  as figure 1 above shows  increasing the pressure ratio increases the efficiency of the brayton cycle  this is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the
when the
is increased  however  there are practical limits when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio  first of all  increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor discharge temperature  this can cause the temperature of the gasses leaving the combustor to exceed the metallurgical limits of the turbine  also  the diameter of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in higher pressure stages of the compressor  because the gap between the blades and the engine casing increases in size as a percentage of the compressor blade height as the blades get smaller in diameter  a greater percentage of the compressed air can leak back past the blades in higher pressure stages  this causes a drop in compressor efficiency  and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines  since blades are inherently smaller to begin with   finally  as can be seen in figure 1  the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases  hence  there is little to gain by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level 
recuperator  if the brayton cycle is run at a low pressure ratio and a high temperature increase in the combustion chamber  the exhaust gas  after the last turbine stage  might still be hotter than the compressed inlet gas  after the last compression stage but before the combustor   in that case  a heat exchanger can be used to transfer thermal energy from the exhaust to the already compressed gas  before it enters the combustion chamber  the thermal energy transferred is effectively re-used  thus increasing efficiency  however  this form of heat recycling is only possible  if the engine is run in a low efficiency mode with low pressure ratio in the first place 
note  that transferring heat from the outlet  after the last turbine  to the inlet  before the first compressor stage  would reduce efficiency  as hotter inlet air means more volume and thus more work for the compressor  for engines with liquid cryogenic fuels  namely   it might be feasible  though  to use the fuel to cool the inlet air before compression to increase efficiency  this concept is extensively studied for the
engine 
a brayton engine also forms half of the    system  which combines with a
to further increase overall efficiency  however  although this increases overall efficiency  it does not actually increase the efficiency of the brayton cycle itself 
systems make use of the waste heat from brayton engines  typically for hot water production or space heating

a closed brayton cycle recirculates the   the air expelled from the turbine is reintroduced into the compressor  this cycle uses a
to heat the working fluid instead of an internal combustion chamber  the closed brayton cycle is used for example in
and space power generation 
solar brayton cycle  
in 2002  a hybrid open solar brayton cycle was operated for the first time consistently and effectively with relevant papers published  in the frame of the eu solgate program  the air was heated from 570k to over 1000k into the combustor chamber  further hybridization was achieved during the eu solhyco project running a hybridized brayton cycle with solar energy and biodiesel only  this technology was scaled up to 4.6mw within the project solugas located near seville where it is currently demonstrated at pre-commercial scale 
reverse brayton cycle  
a brayton cycle that is driven in reverse  via net work input  and when air is the working fluid  is the
or bell coleman cycle  its purpose is to move heat  rather than produce work  this air cooling technique is used widely in jet aircraft for air conditioning systems utilizing air tapped from the engine compressors  it is also used in the
industry where the largest reverse brayton cycle is for subcooling lng using 86 mw of power from a gas turbine driven compressor and nitrogen refrigerant
