in   performance per watt is a measure of the
of a particular
or   literally  it measures the
that can be delivered by a computer for every
of power consumed  performance  unlike watt  isn t an objective thing  it depends on what the computer is working on  but the
list ranks the most efficient computers  according to one  possible   
system designers building   such as   pick cpus based on their  other than green500  performance per watt of power  because the cost of powering the cpu outweighs the cost of the cpu itself

definition  
the performance and power consumption metrics used depend on the definition  reasonable measures of performance are     or the score for any   several measures of power usage may be employed  depending on the purposes of the metric  for example  a metric might only consider the electrical power delivered to a machine directly  while another might include all power necessary to run a computer  such as cooling and monitoring systems  the power measurement is often the average power used while running the benchmark  but other measures of power usage may be employed  e g  peak power  idle power  
for example  the early
computer performed approximately 0.015 operations per watt-second  performing 1,905 operations per second  ops   while consuming 125kw   the
 
in the 4 fr550 core variant released 2005 performs 51 giga-ops with 3 watts of power consumption resulting in 17 billion operations per watt-second  this is an improvement by over a trillion times in 54 years 
most of the power a computer uses is converted into heat  so a system that takes fewer watts to do a job will require less cooling to maintain a given   reduced cooling demands makes it easier to   lower energy consumption can also make it less costly to run  and reduce the environmental impact of powering the computer  see    if installed where there is limited   a lower power computer will operate at a lower temperature  which may make it more reliable  in a climate controlled environment  reductions in direct power use may also create savings in climate control energy 
computing energy consumption is sometimes also measured by reporting the energy required to run a particular benchmark  for instance
energybench  energy consumption figures for a standard workload may make it easier to judge the effect of an improvement in energy efficiency 
performance  in operations second  per watt can also be written as operations watt-second  or operations joule  since 1 watt   1 joule second 
flops per watt  
exponential growth of supercomputer performance per watt based on data from the green500 list  the red crosses denote the most power efficient computer  while the blue ones denote the computer ranked 500 
  operations per second  per watt is a common measure  like the flops it is based on  the metric is usually applied to
and simulations involving many
calculations

gpu efficiency  
 gpu  have continued to increase in energy usage  while cpus designers have recently focused on improving performance per watt  high performance gpus may draw large amount of power and hence  intelligent techniques are required to manage gpu power consumption  measures like
per watt can help identify more efficient gpus  however that may not adequately incorporate efficiency in typical use  where much time is spent doing less demanding tasks 
with modern gpus  energy usage is an important constraint on the maximum computational capabilities that can be achieved  gpu designs are usually highly scalable  allowing the manufacturer to put multiple chips on the same video card  or to use multiple video cards that work in parallel  peak performance of any system is essentially limited by the amount of power it can draw and the amount of heat it can dissipate  consequently  performance per watt of a gpu design translates directly into peak performance of a system that uses that design 
since gpus may also be used for some   sometimes their performance is measured in terms also applied to cpus  such as flops per watt 
challenges  
while performance per watt is useful  absolute power requirements are also important  claims of improved performance per watt may be used to mask increasing power demands  for instance  though newer generation gpu architectures may provide better performance per watt  continued performance increases can negate the gains in efficiency  and the gpus continue to consume large amounts of power 
benchmarks that measure power under heavy load may not adequately reflect typical efficiency  for instance  3dmark stresses the 3d performance of a gpu  but many computers spend most of their time doing less intense display tasks  idle  2d tasks  displaying video   so the 2d or idle efficiency of the graphics system may be at least as significant for overall energy efficiency  likewise  systems that spend much of their time in standby or
are not adequately characterized by just efficiency under load  to help address this some benchmarks  like   include measurements at a series of load levels 
the efficiency of some electrical components  such as   decreases with increasing temperature  so the power used may increase with temperature  power supplies  motherboards  and some video cards are some of the subsystems affected by this  so their power draw may depend on temperature  and the temperature or temperature dependence should be noted when measuring 
performance per watt also typically does not include full   since computer manufacturing is energy intensive  and computers often have a relatively short lifespan  energy and materials involved in production  distribution 
and
often make up significant portions of their cost  energy use  and environmental impact 
energy required for climate control of the computer s surroundings is often not counted in the wattage calculation  but it can be significant 
other energy efficiency measures  
swap  space  wattage and performance  is a
metric for data centers  incorporating energy and space 
swap   performance    space  power 
where performance is measured by any appropriate benchmark  and space is size of the computer
