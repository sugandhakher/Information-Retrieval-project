etymology  
see also 
the netherlands in its entirety is often referred to by the much older designation     meaning holt land  or wood land   though this refers only to
and   two of the nation s twelve provinces  formerly a single province and earlier the   this originally
county emerged from the dissolved
and was  after the decline of   economically and politically the most important county in the region  because of this importance and the emphasis on holland during the
in the 17th and 18th century  holland served as a
for the entire country in english  and is considered either incorrect  informal  or on occasion opprobrious  depending on the context  but is more acceptable when referring to the  
place names with neder  or lage   nieder  nether  or low  and nedre are in use in various places in countries where a germanic language is spoken  and has in french and latin its respective counterparts in bas or inferior  they are sometimes used in relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as upper  boven  oben  superior or haut  in the case of the low countries the geographical location of the lower region has been more or less downstream and near the sea  the geographical location of the upper region changed over time tremendously  the
made a distinction between the roman provinces of downstream
 nowadays part of belgium and the netherlands  and upstream
 nowadays part of germany   the designation  low  to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century duchy of   that covered much of the low countries  but this time the corresponding upper region is   in nowadays northern france  the   who ruled the low countries in the 15th century  used the term les pays de par de    the lands over here  for the low countries as opposed to les pays de par del    the lands over there  for their original homeland 
in present-day east-central france 
under   les pays de par de developed in pays d embas  lands down-here   a deictic expression in relation to other habsburg possessions in europe  this was translated as neder-landen in contemporary dutch official documents  however  niderlant was also the region between the
and the lower
in the late middle ages  the area known as oberland  high country  was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located  
from the mid-sixteenth century on  the low countries or the  netherlands  was besides  probably the most commonly used name  the
 15681648  divided the low countries into the northern
 belgica foederata in   the  federated netherlands   and the
 belgica regia   royal netherlands    the low countries today is a designation that includes the countries the netherlands 
and   it is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term

 rijn   the
 maas  and the
 schelde   as well as their   the south-western part of the netherlands is to this day a
of these three rivers  the  
the netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the rhine  the   its main tributary branch  and the meuse  in the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between
and hence historically created a cultural divide  as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the dutch call their  great rivers   de grote rivieren   another significant branch of the rhine  the
river  discharges into   the former
  southern sea    just like the previous  this river forms a linguistic divide  people to the northeast of this river speak
dialects  except for the province of   which has its own language

was the result of a northwesterly storm  in total  approximately 14,000 people drowned 
over the centuries  the dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention  most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134  which created the

on 14 december 1287 
affected the netherlands and germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history  the
of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed   replacing it with the 72-square-kilometre  28sqmi 
tidal floodplains in the south-centre  the huge
caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the netherlands  more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood  the dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme  the     to protect the country against future flooding  which was completed over a period of more than thirty years 
map illustrating areas of the netherlands below sea level
the impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity  relatively high-lying
was drained to be used as farmland  the drainage caused the fertile
to contract and ground levels to drop  upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level  causing the underlying peat to contract further  additionally  until the 19th century peat was mined  dried  and used for fuel  further exacerbating the problem  centuries of extensive and poorly controlled
extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres  even in flooded areas  peat extraction continued through turf dredging 
because of the flooding  farming was difficult  which encouraged foreign trade  the result of which was that the dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th 15th century 
to guard against floods  a series of defences against the water were contrived  in the first millennium   villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called terps  later  these terps were connected by dikes  in the 12th century  local government agencies called      water boards   or      high home councils   started to appear  whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods  these agencies continue to exist  as the ground level dropped  the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system  by the 13th century
had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level  the windmills were later used to drain lakes  creating the famous    
a polder at 5.53 metres below sea level 
in 1932 the
  closure dike   was completed  blocking the former
 southern sea  from the north sea and thus creating the
  lake   it became part of the larger
in which four polders totalling 2,500 square kilometres  965sqmi  were reclaimed from the sea 
the netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from   not only is the rising sea a problem  but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow 
delta works  
main article

and  
after the   the
were constructed  a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the dutch coast  the project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the   new projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the delta works  a main goal of the delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in south holland and zeeland to once per 10,000 years  compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country   this was achieved by raising 3,000 kilometres  1,864mi  of outer sea-dykes and 10,000 kilometres  6,214mi  of inner  canal  and river dikes  and by closing off the sea
of the zeeland province  new risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional delta project dyke reinforcements  the delta project is considered by the
as one of the  
it is anticipated that
in the 21st century will result in a rise in
which  despite popular belief  will possibly not overwhelm the     even more specifically  the netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise  a politically neutral delta commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of 1.10 metres  3.6ft  and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 centimetres  3.9in   the plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like
and
with 1.30 metres  4.3ft  of additional flood protection  climate change will not only threaten the netherlands from the sea side  but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run-off  to protect the country from river flooding  another program is already being executed  the
grants more flow space to rivers  protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands  the few residents who lived in these so-called  overflow areas  have been moved to higher ground  with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels 
protecting the country against floods is one element of climate change  the other is that the pressure of the sea water on ground water will increase    as a result  the fresh water table will be pushed more inland  resulting in more brackish or saline groundwater in the coastal provinces  due to this change  some drinking water areas will be forced to apply desalination despite the apparent abundance of water  it will also affect agriculture  the
can continue their production by becoming more water efficient  they are already disconnected from the groundwater  thereby not becoming more saline   though they will need to become more energy and water efficient  the push of more brackish water into the mainland will also cause changes in flora and fauna   
climate  
the predominant wind direction in the netherlands is southwest  which causes a moderate   with warm summers and cool winters  and typically high humidity  this is especially true close to the dutch coastline  where the difference in temperature between summer and winter  as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country
