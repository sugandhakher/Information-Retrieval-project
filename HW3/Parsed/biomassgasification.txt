gasification is a process that converts
or
based
materials into  
and   this is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures   700c   without combustion  with a controlled amount of

 from synthesis gas or synthetic gas  or
and is itself a fuel  the power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas is considered to be a source of
if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass 
the advantage of gasification is that using the syngas is potentially more efficient than direct combustion of the original fuel because it can be combusted at higher temperatures or even in   so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by

history  
3 with gas generator  1941 
the process of producing energy using the gasification method has been in use for more than 180 years  in the early time
and
were used to power these plants  initially developed to produce
for lighting and cooking in the 1800s  this was replaced by electricity and   it was also used in
but the bigger role was played in the production of
chemicals where it has been in use since the 1920s 
during both   especially the   the need for fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum    called gasogene or gazogne  were used to power motor vehicles in   by 1945 there were trucks  buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification  it is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world 
chemical reactions  
in a gasifier  the carbonaceous material undergoes several different processes 
pyrolysis of carbonaceous fuels
gasification of char
the
or drying process occurs at around 100c  typically the resulting steam is mixed into the gas flow and may be involved with subsequent chemical reactions  notably the water-gas reaction if the temperature is sufficiently high  see step  5  
the
 or devolatilization  process occurs at around 200-300c  volatiles are released and
is produced  resulting in up to 70  weight loss for coal  the process is dependent on the properties of the carbonaceous material and determines the structure and composition of the char  which will then undergo gasification reactions 
the
process occurs as the volatile products and some of the char react with oxygen to primarily form carbon dioxide and small amounts of carbon monoxide  which provides heat for the subsequent gasification reactions  letting c represent a carbon-containing   the basic reaction here is

the gasification process occurs as the char reacts with steam to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen  via the reaction

in addition  the
gas phase
reaches
very fast at the temperatures in a gasifier  this balances the concentrations of carbon monoxide  steam  carbon dioxide and hydrogen

in essence  a limited amount of oxygen or air is introduced into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be  burned  to produce carbon dioxide and energy  which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide  further reactions occur when the formed carbon monoxide and residual
from the organic material react to form methane and excess carbon dioxide

   this third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the
of the reactive gases and organic materials  as well as heat and pressure 
are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates  thus moving the system closer to the reaction equilibrium for a fixed residence time 
gasification processes  
main gasifier types
several types of gasifiers are currently available for commercial use  counter-current fixed bed  co-current fixed bed    entrained flow  plasma  and free radical 
counter-current fixed bed   up draft   gasifier  
a fixed bed of carbonaceous fuel  e g  coal or biomass  through which the  gasification agent   steam  oxygen and or air  flows in counter-current configuration  the ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a   the slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon  achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature  the nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking so that it will form a permeable bed  although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent    the throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low  thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low  however  this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures  so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use  the tar can be recycled to the reactor 
in the gasification of fine  undensified biomass such as   it is necessary to blow air into the reactor by means of a fan  this creates very high gasification temperature  as high as 1000 c  above the gasification zone  a bed of fine and hot char is formed  and as the gas is blow forced through this bed  most complex hydrocarbons are broken down into simple components of hydrogen and carbon monoxide   
co-current fixed bed   down draft   gasifier  
similar to the counter-current type  but the gasification agent gas flows in co-current configuration with the fuel  downwards  hence the name  down draft gasifier    heat needs to be added to the upper part of the bed  either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources  the produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature  and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed  resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type  since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration  tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type 
fluidized bed reactor  
the fuel is
in oxygen and steam or air  the ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize  the temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers  so the fuel must be highly reactive  low-grade coals are particularly suitable  the agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures  and are suitable for higher rank coals  fuel throughput is higher than for the fixed bed  but not as high as for the entrained flow gasifier  the conversion efficiency can be rather low due to
of carbonaceous material  recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion  fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers  biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash 
entrained flow gasifier  
a dry pulverized solid  an atomized liquid fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen  much less frequent  air  in co-current flow  the gasification reactions take place in a dense cloud of very fine particles  most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high
and because the coal particles are well separated from one another 
the high temperatures and pressures also mean that a higher throughput can be achieved  however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned with existing technology  the high temperatures also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas  however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers  all entrained flow gasifiers remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature 
a smaller fraction of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry
or as a black colored fly ash slurry  some fuels  in particular certain types of biomasses  can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall  however some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag  these types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags 
some fuels have ashes with very high ash fusion temperatures  in this case mostly limestone is mixed with the fuel prior to gasification  addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures  the fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifiers  this means the fuel must be pulverized  which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifiers  by far the most energy consumption related to entrained flow gasification is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the gasification 
plasma gasifier  
in a
a high-voltage current is fed to a torch  creating a high-temperature arc  the inorganic residue is retrieved as a glass-like substance 
feedstock  
there are a large number of different feedstock types for use in a gasifier  each with different characteristics  including size  shape  bulk density  moisture content  energy content  chemical composition  ash fusion characteristics  and homogeneity of all these properties  coal and petroleum coke are used as primary feedstocks for many large gasification plants worldwide  additionally  a variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified  with wood pellets and chips  waste wood  plastics and aluminium 
 msw  
 rdf   agricultural and industrial wastes  sewage sludge  switch grass  discarded seed corn  corn stover and other crop residues all being used 
has developed a process for gasification of  
waste disposal  
htcw reactor  one of several proposed waste gasification processes  according to the sales and sales management consultants kbi group a pilot plant in arnstadt implementing this process has completed initial tests 
waste gasification has several advantages over incineration 
the necessary extensive flue gas cleaning may be performed on the syngas instead of the much larger volume of
after combustion 
may be generated in
and   which are much cheaper and more efficient than the
used in incineration  even fuel cells may potentially be used  but these have rather severe requirements regarding the purity of the gas 
chemical processing    of the syngas may produce other synthetic fuels instead of electricity 
some gasification processes treat ash containing heavy metals at very high temperatures so that it is released in a glassy and chemically stable form 
a major challenge for waste gasification technologies is to reach an acceptable  positive  gross electric efficiency  the high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing  the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen  which is often used as gasification agent   and gas cleaning  another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long service intervals in the plants  so that it is not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor 
environmental advocates have called gasification  incineration in disguise  and argue that the technology is still dangerous to air quality and public health   since 2003 numerous proposals for waste treatment facilities hoping to use    gasification technologies failed to receive final approval to operate when the claims of project proponents did not withstand public and governmental scrutiny of key claims   according to the global alliance for incinerator alternatives  one facility which operated from 2009-2011 in ottawa had 29  emissions incidents  and 13  spills  over those three years  it was also only able to operate roughly 25  of the time 
several waste gasification processes have been proposed  but few have yet been built and tested  and only a handful have been implemented as plants processing real waste  and most of the time in combination with fossil fuels 
one plant  in   japan using the thermoselect process  has been processing industrial waste since year 2000  but has not yet documented positive net energy production from the process 
in the united states  gasification of waste is expanding across the country 
is operating a waste gasification demonstration facility in   the facility was designed to demonstrate gasification of specific non-msw waste streams using liquid metal gasification  this facility came after widespread public opposition shelved plans for a similar plant in   in addition  construction of a biomass gasification plant  
also in the usa  plasma is being used to gasify municipal solid waste  hazardous waste and biomedical waste at the hurlburt field florida special operations command air force base  pyrogenesis canada inc  is the technology provider  innerpoint energy in cedar hill  mo has a gasification system going 
current applications  
syngas can be used for heat production and for generation of mechanical and electrical power  like other gaseous fuels  producer gas gives greater control over power levels when compared to solid fuels  leading to more efficient and cleaner operation 
syngas can also be used for further processing to liquid fuels or chemicals 
heat  
gasifiers offer a flexible option for thermal applications  as they can be retrofitted into existing gas fueled devices such as       etc   where syngas may replace fossil fuels 
of syngas are generally around 4-10 mj m3 
electricity  
currently industrial-scale gasification is primarily used to produce electricity from fossil fuels such as coal  where the syngas is burned in a gas turbine  gasification is also used industrially in the production of electricity  ammonia and liquid fuels  oil  using integrated gasification combined cycles     with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells  igcc is also a more efficient method of co2 capture as compared to conventional technologies  igcc demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service 
combined heat and power  
in small business and building applications  where the wood source is sustainable  250-1000 kwe and new zero carbon biomass gasification plants have been installed in europe that produce tar free syngas from wood and burn it in reciprocating engines connected to a generator with heat recovery  this type of plant is often referred to as a wood biomass chp unit but is a plant with seven different processes  biomass processing  fuel delivery  gasification  gas cleaning  waste disposal  electricity generation and heat recovery 
transport fuel  
can be operated on dual fuel mode using producer gas  diesel substitution of over 80  at high loads and 70-80  under normal load variations can easily be achieved 
and
can operate on 100  gasification gas  mechanical energy from the engines may be used for e g  driving water pumps for irrigation or for coupling with an alternator for electrical power generation 
while small scale gasifiers have existed for well over 100 years  there have been few sources to obtain a ready to use machine  small scale devices are typically
projects  however  currently in the united states  several companies offer gasifiers to operate small engines 
renewable energy and fuels  
gasification plant gssing  austria  2006 
in principle  gasification can proceed from just about any organic material  including biomass and plastic waste  the resulting syngas can be combusted  alternatively  if the syngas is clean enough  it may be used for power production in gas engines  gas turbines or even fuel cells  or converted efficiently to
 dme  by methanol dehydration  methane via the   or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the   in many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material  such as metals and minerals  are retained in the ash  in some gasification processes  slagging gasification  this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low
properties  but the net power production in slagging gasification is low  sometimes negative  and costs are higher 
regardless of the final fuel form  gasification itself and subsequent processing neither directly emits nor traps
such as carbon dioxide  power consumption in the gasification and syngas conversion processes may be significant though  and may indirectly cause co2 emissions  in slagging and plasma gasification  the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the syngas 
combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits exactly the same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct combustion of the initial fuel  biomass gasification and combustion could play a significant role in a renewable energy economy  because biomass production removes the same amount of co2 from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion  while other biofuel technologies such as biogas and
are   gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels 
there are at present a few industrial scale biomass gasification plants  since 2008 in svenljunga  sweden  a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 mwth  supplying industries and citizens of svenljunga with process steam and   respectively  the gasifier uses
such as
or
impregnated waste wood and other kinds of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site  in 2011 a similar gasifier  using the same kinds of fuels  is being installed at  s
plant  the chp plant will generate 2 mwe  electricity  and 8 mwth    
examples of demonstration projects include 
the 32 mw dual fluidized bed gasification of the
project in   sweden  producing around 20 mw of
from forest residues and feeding into the natural gas grid since december 2014 
those of the renewable energy network austria  including a plant using dual fluidized bed gasification that has supplied the town of
