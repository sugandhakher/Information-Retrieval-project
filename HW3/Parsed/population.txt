a population is the number of all the
of the same group or   which live in a particular   and have the capability of interbreeding 
the area that is used to define a
population is defined as the area where
is potentially possible between any pair within the area  and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of

in
a sexual population is a set of organisms in which any pair of members can
together  this means that they can regularly exchange gametes to produce normally-fertile offspring  and such a breeding group is also known therefore as a gamodeme  this also implies that all members belong to the same species  if the gamodeme is very large  theoretically  approaching infinity   and all gene alleles are uniformly distributed by the gametes within it  the gamodeme is said to be panmictic  under this state 
   frequencies can be converted to genotype    frequencies by expanding an appropriate   as shown by sir
in his establishment of quantitative genetics 
this seldom occurs in nature  localisation of gamete exchange  through dispersal limitations  preferential mating  cataclysm  or other cause  may lead to small actual gamodemes which exchange gametes reasonably uniformly within themselves  but are virtually separated from their neighbouring gamodemes  however  there may be low frequencies of exchange with these neighbours  this may be viewed as the breaking up of a large sexual population  panmictic  into smaller overlapping sexual populations  this failure of
leads to two important changes in overall population structure   1  the component gamodemes vary  through gamete sampling  in their allele frequencies when compared with each other and with the theoretical panmictic original  this is known as dispersion  and its details can be estimated using expansion of an appropriate    and  2  the level of homozygosity rises in the entire collection of gamodemes  the overall rise in homozygosity is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient  f or    note that all homozygotes are increased in frequency  both the deleterious and the desirable  the mean phenotype of the gamodemes collection is lower than that of the panmictic  original   which is known as inbreeding depression  it is most important to note  however  that some dispersion lines will be superior to the panmictic original  while some will be about the same  and some will be inferior  the probabilities of each can be estimated from those binomial equations  in
and   procedures have been developed which deliberately utilise the effects of dispersion  such as line breeding  pure-line breeding  back-crossing   it can be shown that dispersion-assisted selection leads to the greatest genetic advance  g change in the phenotypic mean   and is much more powerful than selection acting without attendant dispersion  this is so for both allogamous  random fertilization  and autogamous  self-fertilization  gamodemes 
in ecology  the population of a certain species in a certain area can be estimated using the  
world human population  
main article 
as of today s date  the world population is
by the
to be 7.463   the us census bureau estimates the 7 billion number was surpassed on 12 march 2012  according to a separate estimate by the united nations  earths population exceeded seven billion in october 2011  a milestone that offers unprecedented challenges and opportunities to all of humanity  according to   the united nations population fund 
according to papers published by the united states census bureau  the world population hit 6.5 billion on 24 february 2006  the
designated 12 october 1999 as the approximate day on which world population reached 6 billion  this was about 12 years after world population reached 5 billion in 1987  and 6 years after world population reached 5.5 billion in 1993  the population of countries such as   is not even known to the nearest million  so there is a considerable margin of error in such estimates 
researcher carl haub calculated that a total of over 100 billion people have probably been born in the last 2000 years 
predicted growth and decline  
the years taken for every billion people to be added to the world s population  and the years that population was reached  with future estimates  
main article 
increased significantly as the
gathered pace from 1700 onwards  the last 50 years have seen a yet more rapid increase in the
of population growth due to
and substantial increases in agricultural productivity  particularly beginning in the 1960s  made by the   in 2007 the
projected that the world s population will likely surpass 10 billion in 2055 
in the future  the world s population is expected to peak  after which it will decline due to economic reasons  health concerns  land exhaustion and environmental hazards  according to one report  it is very likely that the world s population will stop growing before the end of the 21st century  further  there is some likelihood that population will actually decline before 2100  population has already declined in the last decade or two in eastern europe  the baltics and in the commonwealth of independent states 
the population pattern of less-developed regions of the world in recent years has been marked by gradually declining birth rates  these followed an earlier sharp reduction in death rates  this transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates is often referred to as the  
control  
main article 
human population control is the practice of altering the rate of growth of a human population  historically  human population control has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of population growth  in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s  concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty  environmental degradation and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates  while population control can involve measures that improve people s lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction  a few programmes  most notably the chinese government s one-child per family policy  have resorted to coercive measures 
in the 1970s  tension grew between population control advocates and women s health activists who advanced women s
as part of a -based approach  growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1980s
