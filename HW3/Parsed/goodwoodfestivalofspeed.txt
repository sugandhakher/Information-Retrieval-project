thanks to the event s classification as a   its location and desire to reflect the style and history of motor sport  visitors are afforded close views of the action - separated only by a few metres and reinforced straw bales from the track  visitors are free to walk around several paddocks where the cars and drivers can be seen at close quarters  the atmosphere of the festival of speed  when compared to the separation of fans from drivers and machines common to most top end motor sport events  encourages participation by the fans 
the track has an elevation change of 92.7 metres  for an average gradient of 4.9   the record time for the hillclimb was set in 1999 when
drove a
formula one car up the hill in 41.6 seconds  100.385mph  161.554km h    for safety reasons formula one cars are no longer allowed to do official timed runs  and will often focus on demonstrations that are spectacular rather than fast  in 2006

f1 car and was unofficially timed below 40 seconds 
in 2016  to commemorate the 40 year anniversary of
winning the f1 world championship  mclaren commissioned a p1 gtr which ran up the hill driven by  
soapbox challenge  
from 2000 to 2004 this was a downhill race for gravity-powered cars  starting from just below the hill-climb finish line  to a finish line in front of the house  it included entries from     and other top companies  with some famous riders drivers piloting them  including   however  there were frequent accidents  despite an official cap on the cost of cars  the unofficial costs were becoming too high  so it did not return in 2005 
the forest rally stage  
from 2005 to present there has been a demonstration area for the rally cars at the top of the hill  initially  in 2005  the track through the forest was widened  and the rally cars ran down through the forest  turned on the tarmac section just outside the wood  and returned up the same track  this meant that the cars could only run one-at-a-time 
in 2006  a full forest stage was introduced  designed by
this was a complete circuit  with a separate start and finish line at the top of the wood  this allowed the cars to start at timed intervals  allowing many more cars to run  ever since its inception southern car club have been entrusted with the organization of the rally stage  held under an msa permit

the moving motor show  
since 2010  the moving motor show  was added  mainly in response to the cancellation of the

mclaren mp4-12c at the 2010 festival of speed
the 2010 event also included the running of the new mclaren mp4-12c 
the official website lists the festival of speed dates as the friday to sunday  but the weekend tickets for the festival include a moving motor show ticket  so it s not strictly part of the festival of speed  but it is a part of the festival of speed weekend
