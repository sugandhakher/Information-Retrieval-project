one conceptual plan of a super grid linking renewable sources across north africa  the middle east and europe      
a super grid is a wide area transmission
that makes it possible to trade high volumes of electricity across great distances  it is sometimes also referred to as a  mega grid

history  
the idea of creating long distance transmission lines in order to take advantage of renewable sources distantly located is not new  in the us in the 1950s  a proposal was made to ship
power from dams being constructed in the
to consumers in   but it was opposed and scrapped  in 1961  u s  president
authorized a large public works project using new
technology from   the project was undertaken as a close collaboration between
of the u s  and
of   and the system was commissioned in 1970  with several upgrades of the converter stations in the intervening decades  the system now has a capacity of 3100 mw and is known as the  
the concept of a  super grid  dates back to the 1960s and was used to describe the emerging unification of the great britain grid  in the code that governs the british grid  the grid code  the supergrid is currently defined - and has been since this code was first written  in 1990 - as referring to those parts of the british electricity transmission system that are connected at voltages in excess of 200 kv  200,000 volts   british power system planners and operational staff therefore invariably speak of the supergrid in this context  in practice the definition used captures all of the equipment owned by the national grid company in england and wales  and no other equipment 
what has changed during the past 40 years is the scale of energy and distances that are imagined possible in a super grid  europe began unifying its grids since the 1950s and its largest
is the
serving 24countries  serious work is being conducted on unification of the european ucte grid with the neighboring
grid  if completed  this massive grid would span 13time zones stretching from the atlantic to the pacific 
while such grids cover great distances  the capacity to transmit large volumes of electricity remains limited due to congestion and control issues  the
 europe  and the
 us  specify major technological upgrades that proponents claim are necessary to assure the practical operation and promised benefits of such transcontinental mega grids 
concept  
in current usage   super grid  has two senses  one of being a superstructure layer overlaid or super-imposed upon existing regional transmission grid or grids  and the second of having some set of superior abilities exceeding those of even the most advanced grids 
mega grid  
in the  overlay   or  superstructure  meaning  a super grid is a very long distance equivalent of a
capable of large-scale transmission of renewable electricity  in some conceptions  a transmission grid of hvdc transmission lines forms a layer that is distinctly separate in the way that a superhighway system is separate from the system of city streets and regional highways  in more conventional conceptions such as the proposed unification of the european
and
system of the   such a mega grid is no different from typical
where electricity takes an ad-hoc transit route directly through local utility transmission lines or hvdc lines as required  studies for such continental sized systems report there are scaling problems as a result of network complexity  transmission congestion  and the need for rapid diagnostic  coordination and control systems  such studies observe that transmission capacity would need to be significantly higher than current transmission systems in order to promote unimpeded energy trading across distances unbounded by state  regional or national  or even continental borders  as a practical matter  it has become necessary to incorporate
features such as
 wams  into even modest sized regional grids in order to avert major
such as the   dynamic interactions between power generation groups are increasingly complex  and transient disturbances that cascade across neighboring utilities can be sudden  large and violent  accompanied by abrupt changes in the network topology as operators attempt to manually stabilize the network 
superior grid  
in the second sense of an advanced grid  the super grid is superior not only because it is a wide area mega grid  but also because it is highly coordinated from a macro level spanning nations and continents  all the way down to the micro level scheduling low priority loads like water heaters and refrigeration  in the european supersmart grid proposal and the us unified smart grid concept  such super grids have intelligence features in the wide area transmission layer which integrate the local smart grids into a single wide area super grid  this is similar to how the
bound together small networks into a single ubiquitous network 
wide area transmission can be viewed as a horizontal extension of the smart grid  in a paradigm shift  the distinction between transmission and distribution blurs with the integration as energy flow becomes bidirectional  for example  distribution grids in rural areas might generate more energy than they use  turning the local smart grid into a   or a city s fleet of one million electric vehicles could be used to trim peaks in transmission supply by integrating them to the smart grid using
technology 
a 765 kv ac transmission grid designed to carry 400 gw of wind power to cities from midwest at a cost of  60 billion 
one advantage of such a geographically dispersed and dynamically balanced system is that the need for
generation is significantly reduced since
such as     and
can be smoothed  a series of detailed modeling studies by dr  gregor czisch  which looked at the european-wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids using
cables  indicates that europe s entire power usage could come from renewables  with 70  total energy from wind at the same level of cost or lower as at present 
to some critics  such a wide area transmission layer is not novel  they point out that the technology has little difference from that used for regional and national power transmission networks  proponents respond that beyond the qualitative smart grid features that allow instantaneous coordination and balancing of intermittent power sources across international boundaries  the quantitative comprehensiveness has a quality all its own  the claim is made that super grids open up markets  in the same way that freeways revolutionized interstate transport and the internet revolutionized online commerce when comprehensive high capacity networks were built  it is argued that a high capacity super grid must be built in order to provide a distribution network so comprehensive and with such available capacity that energy trading is only limited by how much electricity entrepreneurs can bring to market 
technology  
wide area super grids plans typically call for bulk transmission using
lines  europe s supersmart grid proposal relies on hvdc  and in the us  key decision makers such as
favor a national long distance dc grid system  there are industry advocates of hvac  although
have drawbacks for long distances 
has championed a 765 kv super grid they call i-765 that would provide 400 gw of extra transmission capacity required for producing 20  of us energy from wind farms based in the midwest   see figure above   advocates of hvac point out that hvdc systems are oriented for point to point bulk transmission and multiple connections to them would require expensive complex communication and control equipment as opposed to the simple step up
needed if
were used  currently  there is only one multipoint long distance hvdc transmission system  in the more distant future the voltage loss of current methods could be avoided using experimental superconducting    technology where the transmission cable is cooled by a liquid hydrogen pipeline which is also used to move energy nationwide  the energy losses for creating  containing  and re-cooling liquid hydrogen need to be accounted for 
coordination and control of the network would use
technologies such as
to rapidly detect imbalances in the network caused by fluctuating
sources and potentially respond instantaneously with programmed automatic protection schemes to reroute  reduce load  or reduce generation in response to network disturbances 
government policy  
significant scale  
one study for a european super grid estimates that as much as 750 gw of extra transmission capacity would be required  capacity that would be accommodated in increments of 5 gw with hvdc lines  a recent proposal by transcanada priced a 1,600-km  3-gw hvdc line at  3 billion usd  it would require a corridor 60 meters wide  in india  a recent 6 gw  1,850-km proposal was priced at  790 million and would require a 69 meter wide right of way  with 750 gw of new hvdc transmission capacity required for a european super grid  the land and money needed for new transmission lines would be considerable 
energy independence  
in europe  the
implication of a super grid has been discussed as a way in part to prevent
  in the us  advocates such as
have promoted the idea of a national transmission grid in order to promote  
advocates the
which has comprehensive super grid capabilities  gore and other advocates such as
believe super grids are essential for the eventual complete replacement of the
producing fossil fuel use that feeds  
permits for corridors  
large amounts of land would be required for the
used by the new transmission lines of a super grid  there can be significant opposition to the siting of power lines out of concerns about visual impact  anxiety over perceived health issues  and environmental concerns  the us has a process of designating   and it is likely that this process would be used to specify the pathways for a super grid in that country  in the eu  permits for new overhead lines can easily reach 10 years  in some cases  this has made underground cable more expedient  since land required can be one fifth than that for overhead and the permit process can be significantly faster  underground cable can be more attractive despite its weaknesses of being more expensive  lower capacity  shorter lived  and suffers significantly longer downtimes 
business interests  
siting  
just as superhighways change valuations of land due to the proximity to the ability to transport valuable commodities  businesses are strongly motivated to influence the siting of a super grid to their benefit  the cost of alternative power is the delivered price of electricity  and if production of electricity from north dakota wind or arizona solar is to be competitive  the distance of the connection from the wind farm to the interstate transmission grid must not be great  this is because the feeder line from the generator to the transmission lines is usually paid for by the owner of the generation  some localities will help pay for the cost of these lines  at the cost of local regulation such as that of a   t  boone pickens 
has chosen to pay for the feeder lines privately  some localities  such as
give such projects the power of
which allows companies to seize land in the path of the planned construction 
technology preferences  
energy producers are interested in whether the super grid employs hvdc technology  or uses ac  because the cost of connection to an hvdc line is generally greater than that if the ac is used  the pickens plan favors 765 kv ac transmission  which is considered to be less efficient for long distance transmission 
competition  
in the 1960s  private california power companies opposed the
project with a set of technical objections that were overruled  when the project was completed  consumers in
saved approximately u s   600,000 per day by use of electric power from projects on the
rather than local power companies burning more expensive fossil fuel
