a photovoltaic power station  also known as a solar park  is a large-scale
 pv system  designed for the supply of
into the   they are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the
level  rather than to a local user or users  they are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches  especially when sited in agricultural areas  the generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project 
the
source is via
that convert light directly to electricity  however  this differs from  and should not be confused with   the other large-scale solar generation technology  which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems  both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages  but to date  for a variety of reasons 
technology has seen much wider use in the field  as of 2013  pv systems outnumber concentrators by about 40 to 1 
in some countries  the
of a photovoltaic power stations is rated in
 mwp   which refers to the solar array s
power output  however  canada  japan  spain and some parts of the united states often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in   a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation  a third and less common rating is the
 mva   most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1mwp  as of 2015  the
operating photovoltaic power stations have capacities of close to 600
and projects up to 1
are planned  as at the end of 2015  about 3,400 projects with a combined capacity of 60gwac were solar farms larger than 4mw 
most of the existing large-scale photovoltaic power stations are owned and operated by independent power producers  but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing  to date  almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as
or   but as
have fallen significantly in the last decade and
has been reached in an increasing number of markets  it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist

history  
the first 1 mwp solar park was built by arco solar at lugo near
at the end of 1982  followed in 1984 by a 5.2 mwp installation in   both have since been decommissioned  though carrizo plain is the site for several large plants now being constructed or planned  the next stage followed the 2004 revisions to the
when a substantial volume of solar parks were constructed 
serpa solar park built in portugal in 2006
several hundred installations over 1 mwp have been since been installed in germany  of which more than 50 are over 10 mwp  with its introduction of feed-in tariffs in 2008  spain became briefly the largest market  with some 60 solar parks over 10 mw  but these incentives have since been withdrawn  the usa  china india  france  canada  and italy  amongst others  have also become major markets as shown on the  
the largest sites under construction have capacities of hundreds of mwp and projects at a scale of 1 gwp are being planned 
siting and land use  
the land area required for a desired power output  varies depending on the location  and on the efficiency of the solar modules  the slope of the site and the type of mounting used  fixed tilt solar arrays using typical modules of about 15  efficiency on horizontal sites  need about 1  mw in the tropics and this figure rises to over 2
in northern europe 
because of the longer shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle  this area is typically about 10  higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis tracker  and 20  higher for a 2-axis tracker  though these figures will vary depending on the latitude and topography 
the best locations for solar parks in terms of land use are held to be brown field sites  or where there is no other valuable land use  even in cultivated areas  a significant proportion of the site of a solar farm can also be devoted to other productive uses  such as crop growing or biodiversity 
agrivoltaics  
is co-developing the same area of
for both solar
power as well as for conventional   a recent study found that the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30  increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture 
co-location  
in some cases several different solar power stations  with separate owners and contractors  are developed on adjacent sites  this can offer the advantage of the projects sharing the cost and risks of project infrastructure such as grid connections and planning approval  solar farms can also be co-located with wind farms  sometimes the title  solar park  is used  rather than an individual solar power station 
some examples of such solar clusters are the   where there are 17 different generation projects  neuhardenberg  with eleven plants  and the golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500mw  an extreme example is calling all of the solar farms in the
state of india a single solar park  the  
technology  
most solar parks are
pv systems  also known as free-field solar power plants  they can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis   while tracking improves the overall performance  it also increases the system s installation and maintenance cost  a
converts the array s power output from
to   and connection to the
is made through a high voltage  three phase step up
of typically 10 and above 
solar array arrangements  
the
are the subsystems which convert incoming light into electrical energy  they comprise a multitude of   mounted on support structures and interconnected to deliver a power output to electronic power conditioning subsystems 
a minority of utility-scale solar parks are configured on buildings and so use
solar arrays  the majority are  free field  systems using ground-mounted structures  usually of one of the following types 
fixed arrays  
double glass photovoltaic solar modules  installed on a fixed support structure 
many projects use mounting structures where the solar modules are mounted at a
inclination calculated to provide the optimum annual output profile  the modules are normally oriented towards the equator  at a tilt angle slightly less than the latitude of the site  in some cases  depending on local climatic  topographical or electricity pricing regimes  different tilt angles can be used  or the arrays might be offset from the normal east-west axis to favour morning or evening output 
a variant on this design is the use of arrays  whose tilt angle can be adjusted twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output  they also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle  because the increased output is typically only a few percent  it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design 
dual axis trackers  
bellpuig solar park near
uses pole-mounted 2-axis trackers
to maximise the intensity of incoming direct radiation  solar panels should be orientated normal to the sun s rays  to achieve this  arrays can be designed using   capable of tracking the sun in its daily orbit across the sky  and as its elevation changes throughout the year 
these arrays need to be spaced out to reduce inter-shading as the sun moves and the array orientations change  so need more land area  they also require more complex mechanisms to maintain the array surface at the required angle  the increased output can be of the order of 30  in locations with high levels of   but the increase is lower in temperate climates or those with more significant   due to overcast conditions  for this reason  dual axis trackers are most commonly used in subtropical regions  and were first deployed at utility scale at the lugo plant 
single axis trackers  
a third approach achieves some of the output benefits of tracking  with a lesser penalty in terms of land area  capital and operating cost  this involves tracking the sun in one dimension  in its daily journey across the sky  but not adjusting for the seasons  the angle of the axis is normally horizontal  though some  such as the solar park at nellis airforce base  which have a 20 tilt  incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation  effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt 
are aligned along axes roughly north-south  some use linkages between rows so that the same actuator can adjust the angle of several rows at once 
power conversion  
solar panels produce
 dc  electricity  so solar parks need conversion equipment to convert this to
 ac   which is the form transmitted by the electricity grid  this conversion is done by   to maximise their efficiency  solar power plants also incorporate   either within the inverters or as separate units  these devices keep each solar array string close to its  
there are two primary alternatives for configuring this conversion equipment  centralised and string inverters  although in some cases individual  or
are used  single inverters allows optimizing the output of each panel  and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails 
centralised inverters  
is divided into blocks  each with a centralised inverter
these units have relatively high capacity  typically of the order of 1 mw  so they condition that the output of a substantial block of solar arrays  up to perhaps 2 hectares  4.9 acres  in area  solar parks using centralised inverters are often configured in discrete rectangular blocks  with the related inverter in one corner  or the centre of the block 
string inverters  
are substantially lower in capacity  of the order of 10kw  and condition the output of a single array string  this is normally a whole  or part of  a row of solar arrays within the overall plant  string inverters can enhance the efficiency of solar parks  where different parts of the array are experiencing different levels of insolation  for example where arranged at different orientations  or closely packed to minimise site area 
transformers  
the system inverters typically provide power output at voltages of the order of 480 vac 
operate at much higher voltages of the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of volts  so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid  due to the long lead time  the
chose to keep a spare transformer onsite  as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period  transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years  and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station 
system performance  
the performance of a solar park is a function of the climatic conditions  the equipment used and the system configuration  the primary energy input is the global light irradiance in the plane of the solar arrays  and this in turn is a combination of the direct and the diffuse radiation 
a key determinant of the output of the system is the conversion efficiency of the solar modules  which will depend in particular on the type of
used 
there will be losses between the dc output of the solar modules and the ac power delivered to the grid  due to a wide range of factors such as light absorption losses  mismatch  cable voltage drop  conversion efficiencies  and other parasitic losses  a parameter called the  performance ratio  has been developed to evaluate the total value of these losses  the performance ratio gives a measure of the output ac power delivered as a proportion of the total dc power which the solar modules should be able to deliver under the ambient climatic conditions  in modern solar parks the performance ratio should typically be in excess of 80  
system degradation  
early photovoltaic systems output decreased as much as 10  year  but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5  year  with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate  so that a system would lose only 12  of its output performance in 25 years  a system using modules which degrade 4  year will lose 64  of its output during the same period  many panel makers offer a performance guarantee  typically 90  in ten years and 80  over 25 years  the output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3  during the first year of operation 
the business of developing solar parks  
is the world s largest community-owned solar power station
solar power plants are developed to deliver merchant electricity into the grid as an alternative to other renewable  fossil or nuclear generating stations 
the plant owner is an electricity generator  most solar power plants today are owned by
 ipp s   though some are held by
or
utilities 
some of these power producers develop their own portfolio of power plants  but most solar parks are initially designed and constructed by specialist project developers  typically the developer will plan the project  obtain planning and connection consents  and arrange financing for the capital required  the actual construction work is normally contracted to one or more
 engineering  procurement and construction  contractors 
major milestones in the development of a new photovoltaic power plant are planning consent  grid connection approval  financial close  construction  connection and commissioning  at each stage in the process  the developer will be able to update estimates of the anticipated performance and costs of the plant and the financial returns it should be able to deliver 
planning approval  
photovoltaic power stations occupy at least one
for each megawatt of rated output  so require a substantial land area  which is subject to planning approval  the chances of obtaining consent  and the related time  cost and conditions  varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and location to location  many planning approvals will also apply conditions on the treatment of the site after the station has been decommissioned in the future  a professional health  safety and environment assessment is usually undertaken during the design of a pv power station in order to ensure the facility is designed and planned in accordance with all
regulations 
grid connection  
the availability  locality and capacity of the connection to the grid is a major consideration in planning a new solar park  and can be a significant contributor to the cost 
most stations are sited within a few kilometres of a suitable grid connection point  this network needs to be capable of absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity  the project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection  in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid  so it can accommodate the output from the plant 
operation and maintenance  
once the solar park has been commissioned  the owner usually enters into a contract with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance  o m   in many cases this may be fulfilled by the original epc contractor 
solar plants  reliable solid-state systems require minimal maintenance  compared to rotating machinery for example  a major aspect of the o m contract will be continuous monitoring of the performance of the plant and all of its primary subsystems  which is normally undertaken remotely  this enables performance to be compared with the anticipated output under the climatic conditions actually experienced  it also provides data to enable the scheduling of both rectification and preventive maintenance  a small number of large solar farms use a separate inverter or maximizer for each solar panel  which provide individual performance data that can be monitored  for other solar farms  thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non-performing panels for replacement 
power delivery  
a solar park s income derives from the sales of electricity to the grid  and so its output is metered in real-time with readings of its energy output provided  typically on a half-hourly basis  for balancing and settlement within the electricity market 
income is affected by the reliability of equipment within the plant and also by the availability of the grid network to which it is exporting  some connection contracts allow the
to constrain the output of a solar park  for example at times of low demand or high availability of other generators  some countries make statutory provision for priority access to the grid for renewable generators  such as that under the european  
economics and finance  
in recent years  pv technology has improved its electricity generating   reduced the installation
as well as its
 epbt   and has reached
in at least 19 different markets by 2014  photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power  however  prices for pv systems show strong regional variations  much more than solar cells and panels  which tend to be global commodities  in 2013  utility-scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as china and germany were significantly lower   1.40 w  than in the united states   3.30 w   the
explains these discrepancies due to differences in  soft costs   which include customer acquisition  permitting  inspection and interconnection  installation labor and financing costs  14

grid parity  
main article 
solar generating stations have become progressively cheaper in recent years  and this trend is expected to continue  meanwhile  traditional electricity generation is becoming progressively more expensive  these trends are expected to lead to a crossover point when the levelised cost of energy from solar parks  historically more expensive  matches the cost of traditional electricity generation  this point is commonly referred to as grid parity 
for merchant solar power stations  where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network  the levelised cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price  this point is sometimes called  wholesale grid parity  or  busbar parity  
some photovoltaic systems  such as rooftop installations  can supply power directly to an electricity user  in these cases  the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption  this situation is sometimes called  retail grid parity    socket parity  or  dynamic grid parity   research carried out by
in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices  such as italy  spain and australia  and areas using diesel generators  have reached retail grid parity 
incentive mechanisms  
because the point of grid parity has not yet been reached in many parts of the world  solar generating stations need some form of financial incentive to compete for the supply of electricity  many legislatures around the world have introduced such incentives to support the deployment of solar power stations 
feed-in tariffs  
main article 
feed in tariffs are designated prices which must be paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid  these tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project 
renewable portfolio standards and supplier obligations  
main article 
these standards are obligations on utility companies to source a proportion of their electricity from renewable generators  in most cases  they do not prescribe which technology should be used and the utility is free to select the most appropriate renewable sources 
there are some exceptions where solar technologies are allocated a proportion of the rps in what is sometimes referred to as a  solar set aside  
loan guarantees and other capital incentives  
main article 
some countries and states adopt less targeted financial incentives  available for a wide range of infrastructure investment  such as the us department of energy loan guarantee scheme  which stimulated a number of investments in the solar power plant in 2010 and 2011 
tax credits and other fiscal incentives  
main article 
another form of indirect incentive which has been used to stimulate investment in solar power plant was tax credits available to investors  in some cases the credits were linked to the energy produced by the installations  such as the production tax credits  in other cases the credits were related to the capital investment such as the investment tax credits
international  national and regional programmes  
in addition to free market commercial incentives  some countries and regions have specific programs to support the deployment of solar energy installations 
the  s
sets targets for increasing levels of deployment of renewable energy in all member states  each has been required to develop a
showing how these targets would be met  and many of these have specific support measures for solar energy deployment  the directive also allows states to develop projects outside their national boundaries  and this may lead to bilateral programs such as the helios project 
the
of the
is an international programme under which solar generating stations in certain qualifying countries can be supported 
additionally many other countries have specific solar energy development programmes  some examples are  s   the flagship program in   and similar projects in
and  
financial performance  
the financial performance of the solar power plant is a function of its income and its costs 
the electrical output of a solar park will be related to the solar radiation  the capacity of the plant and its performance ratio  the income derived from this electrical output will come primarily from the sale of the electricity  and any incentive payments such as those under feed-in tariffs or other support mechanisms 
electricity prices may vary at different times of day  giving a higher price at times of high demand  this may influence the design of the plant to increase its output at such times 
the dominant costs of solar power plants are the capital cost  and therefore any associated financing and depreciation  though operating costs are typically relatively low  especially as no fuel is required  most operators will want to ensure that adequate operation and maintenance cover is available to maximise the availability of the plant and thereby optimise the income to cost ratio 
geography  
main articles 
and
the first places to reach grid parity were those with high traditional electricity prices and high levels of solar radiation  currently  more capacity is being installed in the
than in the utility-scale segment  however  the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity  this transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants  since the focus of new pv deployment has changed from europe towards the sunbelt markets where ground-mounted pv systems are favored  43
because of the economic background  large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes have been the most consistent  or the most advantageous  total capacity of worldwide pv plants above 4 mwac was assessed by
as 36 gw in c  2,300 installations at the end of 2014 and represents about 25 percent of total global pv capacity of 139gw  17 the countries which had the most capacity  in descending order  were the              
and   activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below 
china  
main article 
china was reported in early 2013 to have overtaken germany as the nation with the most utility-scale solar capacity  much of this has been supported by the   the distribution of power plants around the country is quite broad  with the highest concentration in the gobi desert and connected to the northwest china power grid 
germany  
main article 
the first multi-megawatt plant in europe was the 4.2 mw community-owned project at hemau  commissioned in 2003  but it was the revisions to the german feed-in tariffs in 2004  which gave the strongest impetus to the establishment of utility-scale solar power plants  the first to be completed under this programme was the leipziger land solar park developed by geosol  several dozen plants were built between 2004 and 2011  several of which were at the time the   the   the law which establishes germanys feed-in tariffs  provides the legislative basis not just for the compensation levels  but other regulatory factors  such as priority access to the grid  the law was amended in 2010 to restrict the use of agricultural land  since which time most solar parks have been built on so-called development land  such as former military sites  partly for this reason  the geographic distribution of photovoltaic power plants in germany is biased towards the former eastern germany  as of february 2012  germany had 1.1 million photovoltaic power plants  most are small kw roof mounted
