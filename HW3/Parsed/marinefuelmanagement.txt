marine fuel management  mfm  is a multi-level approach to measuring  monitoring  and reporting
usage on a boat or   with the goals of reducing fuel usage  increasing operational efficiency  and improving fleet management oversight  mfm has grown in importance due to the rising costs of marine fuel and increased governmental stresses to reduce the pollution generated by the world s fleet 
effective mfm requires that you know 
how much fuel is likely to be used
how much fuel is used
how the fuel was used
what things impact fuel usage
and by how much
manual methods of measuring fuel usage  i e  fuel tank dipping or sounding  typically do not tell how much fuel was used 
traveling versus idling while in
or on station
by a specific
  versus   for example 
performing one job versus another
by crew a versus crew b on similar voyages
without a clear understanding of how fuel is being used  there is no operational
from which to compare any kind of
tool or activity  without a baseline  there is no way to determine if conservation strategies are actually working 
mfm allows a fleet owner to track actual fuel consumption and relate fuel consumption to the work performed by the vessel  it supports the analysis of the effectiveness of operating strategies and helps develop a clearer understanding of how well a vessel uses its fuel

mfm main functional areas  
operational performance
engineering and maintenance management
management oversight
operational performance  
operational performance includes those functional areas that impact the actual performance of a vessel or fleet  it includes fuel monitoring  inventory control  accounting  and engine throttle management 
fuel monitoring  
many marine vessels do not provide a way for captain and crew to measure and monitor fuel usage while underway  an optimum system onboard would include the ability to instantaneously monitor fuel burn rates from the   individual engine and generator burn rates would be included  as well as fuel tank levels  this proactive monitoring would allow the crew to make decisions that positively impact fuel burn rates and efficiency 
inventory control  
fuel tanks need to have sensors installed that continuously monitor levels as fuel is taken onboard and burned by engines and generators  periodically measuring tank levels using traditional manual methods is not accurate enough or timely  given the volumes of fuel that a marine engine can consume  flow meters or gauges should be installed on transfer lines where fuel is taken onboard or off-loaded 
accounting  
in some parts of the world  fuel theft is an ongoing concern  consequently  the accurate measurement of fuel taken on board coupled with the fuel actually consumed by engines and generators  is an important part of mfm  flow meters should be installed in all fuel transfer lines so accurate fueling data can be captured  this data can then be compared with burn rates to determine whether fuel is being transferred off the vessel secretively 
beyond fuel theft  many governmental jurisdictions require that all fuel spill incidents be recorded and reported to the local authorities  for example  the
of the government of hong kong has specific guidelines for responding to accidental marine fuel spills which reflect international requirements as promulgated by   the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 
additionally  accounting for fuel usage at various points along a voyage provides the ability to tie fuel burn and its associated costs to shipping or container rates  for example  understanding how a vessel burns fuel on certain parts of a voyage  allows the more accurate bidding of container rates so profit margins stay healthy  consequently  varying shipping rates based on documented fuel usage rates can allow a shipper to bid more aggressively 
a modern marine
would help in monitoring fuel usage  fuel transfer
events and could be configured to sound an audible alarm when refilling fuel tanks might lead to a spill 
throttle management  
vessel operators have the most control over fuel usage by the way they use the engine s    wind  current 
condition  load  and propulsion system health can all impact fuel burn both positively or negatively  some operators choose to lower engine speed  and hence vessel speed  in an attempt to save fuel  however  engine
and vessel speed alone are not indicative of total fuel consumption  so arbitrarily lowering engine speed does not guarantee fuel savings  one must do the
calculations on how the propulsion system is operating under existing changing conditions and then tie that to fuel consumption  simply lowering engine rpm does not guarantee an optimum vessel speed setting based on conditions  some modern fuel management systems are designed to perform these calculations while underway and make recommendations to the vessel master 
engineering and maintenance management  
as with any capital   manufacturers typically include the standard
practices and procedures needed to keep the asset functioning properly and within design specifications  in many cases  scheduled maintenance routines are based on laboratory or design parameters and do not necessarily represent the optimum  mfm supports proper maintenance on marine engines and generators by using the actual fuel burned or hours operated as the basis for performing maintenance routines  this
program more accurately reflects the operating environment of the engine  but more importantly  reduces or eliminates unnecessary maintenance work 
management oversight  
management functions within mfm include 
vessel performance analysis and overall fleet performance
crew analysis with emphasis on applying lessons learned as
across the fleet
 kpi  gathering across the fleet to include fuel burned per mile or per ton  throttle settings at various points on a voyage  engine rpms and exhaust gas analysis  and vessel performance against hull conditions 
fuel management from purchasing to transfers to usage
vessel fuel performance and adherence to contractual obligations
