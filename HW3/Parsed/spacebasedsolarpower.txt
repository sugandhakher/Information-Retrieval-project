nasa suntower concept 
space-based solar power  sbsp  is the concept of collecting
in
 using an  sps   that is  a  solar-power satellite  or a  satellite power system   for use on   it has been in research since the early 1970s 
sbsp would differ from current
collection methods in that the means used to collect
would reside on an
instead of on earth s surface  some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing
and night
in  
part of the
 5560   is lost on its way through the atmosphere by the effects of
and absorption  space-based solar power systems convert
to microwaves outside the atmosphere  avoiding these losses  and the downtime  and   for fixed flat-plate collectors  due to the  
besides the cost of implementing such a system  sbsp also introduces several new hurdles  primarily the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to earth s surface for use  since wires extending from earth s surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology  sbsp designs generally include the use of some manner of   the collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board  powering a
transmitter or
emitter  and focus its beam toward a collector    on earth s surface 
and
damage could also become concerns for sbsp 
sbsp is considered a form of     and is occasionally considered among
proposals  it is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to
or fossil fuel depletion  such as   
sbsp is being actively pursued by japan and china  in 2008 japan passed its basic space law which established space solar power as a national goal and jaxa has a roadmap to commercial sbsp  in 2015 the china academy for space technology  cast  briefed their roadmap at the international space development conference  isdc  where they showcased their road map to a 1 gw commercial system in 2050 and unveiled a

for the united states to lead in space solar power has recently received high level attention after it won the d3  diplomacy  development  defense  competition sponsored by the secretary of defense  secretary of state  and usaid director  as of may 21  2015  there was an active petition on change org and a second active petition at whitehouse website

glaser then was a vice president at   inc  nasa signed a contract with adl to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974  they found that  while the concept had several major problems chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research 
between 1978 and 1986  the
authorized the
 doe  and

the project was not continued with the change in administrations after the 1980 us federal elections  the
concluded that  too little is currently known about the technical  economic  and environmental aspects of sps to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment  in addition  without further research an sps demonstration or systems-engineering verification program would be a high-risk venture  
in 1997 nasa conducted its  fresh look  study to examine the modern state of sbsp feasibility  in assessing  what has changed  since the doe study  nasa asserted that the  us national space policy now calls for nasa to make significant investments in technology  not a particular vehicle  to drive the costs of eto  earth to orbit  transportation down dramatically  this is  of course  an absolute requirement of space solar power  
conversely  dr 
claimed that space-based solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the arizona desert  with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit  dr  worden referred to possible solutions as speculative  and that would not be available for decades at the earliest

sert sandwich concept nasa
in 1999  nasa s space solar power exploratory research and technology program  sert  was initiated for the following purposes 
perform design studies of selected flight demonstration concepts 
evaluate studies of the general feasibility  design  and requirements 
create conceptual designs of subsystems that make use of advanced ssp technologies to benefit future space or terrestrial applications 
formulate a preliminary plan of action for the u s   working with international partners  to undertake an aggressive technology initiative 
construct technology development and demonstration roadmaps for critical space solar power  ssp  elements 
sert went about developing a solar power satellite  sps  concept for a future
space power system  to provide electrical power by converting the sun s energy and beaming it to earth s surface  and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies  sert proposed an
structure with concentrator lenses or
to convert
into electricity  the program looked both at systems in
and   some of sert s conclusions 
the increasing global energy demand is likely to continue for many decades resulting in new power plants of all sizes being built 
the environmental impact of those plants and their impact on world energy supplies and geopolitical relationships can be problematic 
renewable energy is a compelling approach  both philosophically and in engineering terms 
many renewable energy sources are limited in their ability to affordably provide the base load power required for global industrial development and prosperity  because of inherent land and water requirements 
based on their concept definition study  space solar power concepts may be ready to reenter the discussion 
solar power satellites should no longer be envisioned as requiring unimaginably large initial investments in fixed infrastructure before the emplacement of productive power plants can begin 
space solar power systems appear to possess many significant environmental advantages when compared to alternative approaches 
the economic viability of space solar power systems depends on many factors and the successful development of various new technologies  not least of which is the availability of much lower cost access to space than has been available   however  the same can be said of many other advanced power technologies options 
space solar power may well emerge as a serious candidate among the options for meeting the energy demands of the 21st century  space solar power satellite technology development at the glenn research centeran overview  james e  dudenhoefer and patrick j  george  nasa   cleveland  ohio

jaxa announced on 12 march 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity  this is the standard plan for this type of power  on 12 march 2015 mitsubishi heavy industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts  kw  of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters  m  away 
challenges  
potential  
the sbsp concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the earth s surface for the collection of solar power 
its always
in space and full sun 
collecting surfaces could receive much more intense sunlight  owing to the lack of obstructions such as     dust and other weather events  consequently  the intensity in orbit is approximately 144  of the maximum attainable intensity on earth s surface   
a satellite could be illuminated over 99  of the time  and be in earth s
a maximum of only 72 minutes per night at the spring and fall equinoxes at local midnight  orbiting satellites can be exposed to a consistently high degree of solar   generally for 24 hours per day  whereas the average earth surface solar panels currently collect power for an average of 29  per day 
power could be relatively quickly redirected directly to areas that need it most  a collecting satellite could possibly direct power on demand to different surface locations based on geographical
or
power needs  typical contracts would be for baseload  continuous power  since peaking power is ephemeral   
elimination of
and
interference 
with very large scale implementations  especially at lower altitudes  it potentially can reduce incoming solar radiation reaching earth s surface  this would be desirable for counteracting the effects of  
drawbacks  
the sbsp concept also has a number of problems 
the large cost of launching a satellite into space
inaccessibility  maintenance of an earth-based solar panel is relatively simple  but construction and maintenance on a solar panel in space would typically be done telerobotically  in addition to cost  astronauts working in geo orbit are exposed to unacceptably high radiation dangers and risk and cost about one thousand times more than the same task done telerobotically 
the space environment is hostile  panels suffer about 8 times the degradation they would on earth  except at orbits that are protected by the magnetosphere  
is a major hazard to large objects in space  and all large structures such as sbsp systems have been mentioned as potential sources of orbital debris 
the broadcast frequency of the microwave downlink  if used  would require isolating the sbsp systems away from other satellites  geo space is already well used and it is considered unlikely the
would allow an sps to be launched 
the large size and corresponding cost of the receiving station on the ground   
energy losses during several phases of conversion from  photon to electron to photon back to electron   as
has stated 
design  
artist s concept of a solar disk on top of a leo to geo electrically powered  
space-based solar power essentially consists of three elements 
collecting solar energy in space with reflectors or inflatable mirrors onto
to earth via
or
receiving power on earth via a   a microwave antenna
the space-based portion will not need to support itself against gravity  other than relatively weak tidal stresses   it needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather  but will have to cope with space hazards such as
and   two basic methods of conversion have been studied 
 pv  and
 sd   most analyses of sbsp have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity  solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler  the use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt 
was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the earth s surface  using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies 
there is an annual
hosted by ohio university 
microwave power transmission  
demonstrated in 1964  during  s
news program  a microwave-powered model
that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam  between 1969 and 1975  bill brown was technical director of a
program that beamed 30
of power over a distance of 1 mile  1.6km  at 84  efficiency 
microwave power transmission of tens of kilowatts has been well proven by existing tests at
in california  1975  and grand bassin on
 1997  
comparison of laser and microwave power transmission  nasa diagram
more recently  microwave power transmission has been demonstrated  in conjunction with solar energy capture  between a mountain top in maui and the island of hawaii  92 miles away   by a team under john c  mankins  technological challenges in terms of array layout  single radiation element design  and overall efficiency  as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research  as it is demonstrated by the special session on  analysis of electromagnetic wireless systems for solar power transmission  to be held in the 2010
symposium on antennas and propagation  in 2013  a useful overview was published  covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground  it includes an introduction to sps  current research and future prospects  moreover  a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the proceedings of the ieee
laser power beaming  
power beaming was envisioned by some at nasa as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space  in the 1980s  researchers at nasa worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming  focusing primarily on the development of a solar-powered laser  in 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from earth to space  in 1991 the selene project  space laser energy  had begun  which included the study of
for supplying power to a lunar base  the selene program was a two-year research effort  but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high  and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration 
in 1988 the use of an earth-based laser to power an electric thruster for space propulsion was proposed by grant logan  with technical details worked out in 1989  he proposed using diamond solar cells operating at 600 degrees to convert
laser light 
orbital location  
the main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant  and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler  another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit  other space-based power stations have much longer start-up times before they are producing nearly continuous power  a collection of leo    space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to geo    space-based solar power 
earth-based receiver  
the earth-based
would likely consist of many short
connected via   microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85  efficiency  with a conventional microwave antenna  the reception efficiency is better  but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater  rectennas would likely be several kilometers across 
in space applications  
a laser sbsp could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the moon or mars  saving on mass costs to land the power source  a spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means  in a 2012 report presented to nasa on space solar power  the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind space solar power could be for solar electric propulsion systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions 
launch costs  
one problem for the sbsp concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched 
are predicted to provide lower launch costs to low earth orbit  leo   as of november 2013  one company    is two years along on a
multi-year
for a
with the stated intention to commercialize  fully and rapidly reusable  launch technology  spacex has completed eight
of their low-altitude booster return prototype    and one test flight of a   with a second booster return test flight planned for early 2014 
much of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately  which raises the possibility that high efficiency  but slower  engines could move sps material from leo to geo at an acceptable cost  examples include
or   power beaming from
by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required  optical aperture  sizes are very large  for example  the 1978 nasa sps study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna  and a 10km diameter receiving rectenna  for a microwave beam at   these sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths  although they have increased
and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets  because of the   it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites  the large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an sps will necessarily be high  small sps systems will be possible  but uneconomic 
to give an idea of the scale of the problem  assuming a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt  without considering the mass of the supporting structure  antenna  or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors  a 4 gw power station would weigh about 80,000   all of which would  in current circumstances  be launched from the earth  very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg kw  meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 gw capacity station  this would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150
 hllv  launches to send the material to low earth orbit  where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays  which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to  slowly  reach geo     with an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based hllvs of  500 million to  800 million  and launch costs for alternative hllvs at  78 million  total launch costs would range between  11 billion  low cost hllv  low weight panels  and  320 billion   expensive  hllv  heavier panels     to these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions  if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production  for comparison  the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from  3 billion to  6 billion per gw  not including the full cost to the environment from co2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel  respectively   another example is the
to the moon cost a grand total of  24 billion  1970s  dollars   taking inflation into account  would cost  140 billion today  more expensive than the construction of the  
however  in 2013 based on recent innovations  electric space  space-based solar power technologies   applications suggested a new way to reduce costs by replacing smaller satellites and in lower orbits 
building from space  
from lunar materials launched in orbit  
  noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s  proposed building the sps s in orbit with materials from the  
from the moon are potentially much lower than from earth  due to the lower
and lack of   this 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of nasa s space shuttle  this approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish
on the moon  nevertheless  on 30 april 1979  the final report   lunar resources utilization for space construction   by general dynamics  convair division  under nasa contract nas9-15560  concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty solar power satellites of 10gw capacity each 
in 1980  when it became obvious nasa s launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic  o neill et al  published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs  this 1980s sps concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially
on the lunar surface under
of workers stationed on earth  the high
of this proposal derives from the moon s much shallower  
having a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of sps being built  the low cost per pound of lunar materials in o neill s vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites  advanced techniques for launching from the moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials  some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the   first described by jerome pearson  it would require establishing
mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the    
on the moon  
suggests the moon is the optimum location for solar power stations  and promotes lunar solar power  the main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials  using   with a
mobile factory and crane to assemble the microwave reflectors  and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells  which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to sbsp designs  power relay satellites orbiting around earth and the moon reflecting the microwave beam are also part of the project  a demo project of 1 gw starts at  50 billion  the
use combination of lasers and microwave for the lunar ring concept  along with power relay satellites 
from an asteroid  
has also been seriously considered  a nasa design study evaluated a 10,000 ton mining vehicle  to be assembled in orbit  that would return a 500,000 ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit  only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload  the rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine  which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload  assuming that 100  of the returned asteroid was useful  and that the asteroid miner itself couldn t be reused  that represents nearly a 95  reduction in launch costs  however  the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids  thus far  we have only estimates of their composition  one proposal is to capture the asteroid
into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 gw each or the larger asteroid 1999 an10 which is 50x the size of apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-gigawatt solar power satellites

counter arguments  
safety  
the use of
has been the most controversial issue in considering any sps design  at the earth s surface  a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center  of 23mw cm2  less than 1/4 the    and an intensity of less than 1mw cm2 outside the rectenna fenceline  the receiver s perimeter   these compare with current united states
 osha  workplace exposure limits for microwaves  which are 10mw cm2  - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for federal osha enforcement purposes    a beam of this intensity is therefore at its center  of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels  even for long term or indefinite exposure  outside the receiver  it is far less than the osha long-term levels over 95  of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna  the remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world  it is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna  outside the rectenna  microwave intensities rapidly decrease  so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected 
exposure to the beam is able to be minimized in other ways  on the ground  physical access is controllable  e g   via fencing   and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell  i e   a    which will intercept the microwaves  other aircraft      etc   can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces  as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace  the microwave beam intensity at ground level in the center of the beam would be designed and physically built into the system  simply  the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels  even in principle 
in addition  a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife  particularly birds  experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations  suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore  but this presents serious problems  including corrosion  mechanical stresses  and biological contamination 
a commonly proposed approach to ensuring fail-safe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective
antenna rectenna  a  pilot  microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna  there  circuits in each of the antenna s subarrays compare the pilot beam s phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal  this forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity  if the pilot beam is lost for any reason  if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna  for example  the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused  such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter  the long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied  but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect

the typical reference system-of-systems involves a significant number  several thousand multi-gigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of earth s energy requirements  of individual satellites in geo  the typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 1-10 gw range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltics  pv  as the energy collector   conversion  the most typical transmission designs are in the 110ghz  2.45 or 5.8ghz  rf band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere  materials for the satellites are sourced from  and manufactured on earth and expected to be transported to leo via re-usable rocket launch  and transported between leo and geo via chemical or electrical propulsion  in summary  the architecture choices are 
location   geo
energy collection   pv
satellite   monolithic structure
transmission   rf
materials   manufacturing   earth
installation   rlvs to leo  chemical to geo
there are several interesting design variants from the reference system 
alternate energy collection location  while geo is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to earth  simplified pointing and tracking  very small time in occultation  and scalability to meet all global demand several times over  other locations have been proposed 
sun earth l1  robert kennedy iii  ken roy   david fields have proposed a variant of the l1 sunshade called   s  where a multi-terrawatt primary collector would beam energy back to a series of leo sun-synchronous receiver satellites  the much farther distance to earth requires a correspondingly larger transmission aperture 
lunar surface  dr 
has
itself as the collection medium  beaming power to the ground via a series of microwave reflectors in earth orbit  the chief advantage of this approach would be the ability to manufacture the solar collectors in-situ without the energy cost and complexity of launch  disadvantages include the much longer distance  requiring larger transmission systems  the required  overbuild  to deal with the lunar night  and the difficulty of sufficient manufacturing and pointing of reflector satellites 
meo  meo systems have been proposed for in-space utilities and beam-power propulsion infrastructures  for example  see royce jones   
highly elliptical orbits  molniya  tundra  or quazi zenith orbits have been proposed as early locations for niche markets  requiring less energy to access and providing good persistence  for example  see  
sun-sync leo  in this near polar orbit  the satellites precess at a rate that allows them to always face the sun as they rotate around earth  this is an easy to access orbit requiring far less energy  and its proximity to earth requires smaller  and therefore less massive  transmitting apertures  however disadvantages to this approach include having to constantly shift receiving stations  or storing energy for a burst transmission  this orbit is already crowded and has significant space debris 
equatorial leo  japan s
proposed an early demonstrator in equatorial leo in which multiple equatorial participating nations could receive some power 
earth s surface  dr  narayan komerath has proposed a
where excess energy from an existing grid or power plant on one side of the planet can be passed up to orbit  across to another satellite and down to receivers 
energy collection  the most typical designs for solar power satellites include photovoltaics  these may be planar  and usually passively cooled   concentrated  and perhaps actively cooled   however  there are multiple interesting variants 
solar thermal  proponents of solar thermal have proposed using concentrated heating to cause a state change in a fluid to extract energy via rotating machinery followed by cooling in radiators  advantages of this method might include overall system mass  disputed   non-degradation due to solar-wind damage  and radiation tolerance  one recent thermal solar power satellite design by keith henson has been visualized here 
solar pumped laser  japan has pursued a solar-pumped laser  where sunlight directly excites the lasing medium used to create the coherent beam to earth 
fusion decay  this version of a power-satellite is not  solar   rather  the vacuum of space is seen as a  feature not a bug  for traditional fusion  per dr  paul werbos  after fusion even neutral particles decay to charged particles which in a sufficiently large volume would allow direct conversion to current 
  also called a p satellite  here the satellite makes use not of the photons from the sun but rather the charged particles in the solar wind which via electro-magnetic coupling generate a current in a large loop 
direct mirrors  early concepts for direct mirror re-direction of light to planet earth suffered from the problem that rays coming from the sun are not parallel but are expanding from a disk and so the size of the spot on the earth is quite large  dr  lewis fraas has explored an
to augment existing solar arrays 
alternate satellite architecture  the typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss  one or more collectors  one or more transmitters  and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors  the entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized  alternative designs include 
swarms of smaller satellites  some designs propose swarms of free-flying smaller satellites  this is the case with several laser designs  and appears to be the case with caltech s   for rf designs  an engineering constraint is the
problem 
free floating components 
has proposed an
to the monolithic structure where the primary reflector and transmission reflector are free-flying 
spin stabilization  nasa explored a spin-stabilized thin film concept 
 plt  stabilized structure  dr  young bae has proposed that photon pressure may substitute for compressive members in large structures 
transmission  the most typical design for energy transmission is via an rf antenna at below 10ghz to a rectenna on the ground  controversy exists between the benefits of klystrons  gyrotrons  magnetrons and solid state  alternate transmission approaches include 
laser  lasers offer the advantage of much lower cost and mass to first power  however there is controversy regarding benefits of efficiency  lasers allow for much smaller transmitting and receiving apertures  however  a highly concentrated beam has eye-safety  fire safety  and weaponization concerns  proponents believe they have answers to all these concerns  a laser-based approach must also find alternate ways of coping with precipitation 
atmospheric waveguide  some have proposed it may be possible to use a short pulse laser to
through which concentrated microwaves could flow 
scalar  some have even speculated it may be possible to  
materials and manufacturing  typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on earth  and use earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant  variants include 
lunar materials  designs exist for solar power satellites that source  99  of materials from lunar regolith with very small inputs of  vitamins  from other locations  using materials from the moon is attractive because launch from the moon is in theory far less complicated than from earth  there is no atmosphere  and so components do not need to be packed tightly in an aeroshell and survive vibration  pressure and temperature loads  launch may be via a magnetic mass driver and the requirement to use propellant for launch entirely  launch from the moon the geo also requires far less energy than from earth s much deeper gravity well  building all the solar power satellites to fully supply all the required energy for the entire planet requires less than one millionth of the mass of the moon 
self-replication on the moon  nasa explored a
on the moon in 1980  more recently  justin lewis-webber
a method of speciated manufacture of core elements based upon
design 
asteroidal materials  some asteroids are thought to have even lower delta-v to recover materials than the moon  and some particular materials of interest such as metals may be more concentrated or easier to access 
in-space in-situ manufacturing  with the advent of in-space additive manufacturing  concepts such as
might allow mass launch of raw materials for local extrusion 
method of installation   transportation of material to energy collection location  in the reference designs  component material is launched via well-understood chemical rockets  usually fully reusable launch systems  to leo  after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to geo  the desired characteristics for this system is very high mass-flow at low total cost  alternate concepts include 
lunar chemical launch  ula has recently
for a fully re-usable chemical lander
to move materials from the lunar surface to llo or geo 
lunar   launch of materials from the lunar surface using a system similar to an aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult  an unexplored compact alternative would be the slingatron 
  an equatorial or near-equatorial cable extends to and through the lagrange point  this is claimed by proponents to be lower in mass than a traditional mass driver 
  a ribbon of pure carbon nanotubes extends from its center of gravity in geostationary orbit  allowing climbers to climb up to geo  problems with this include the material challenge of creating a ribbon of such length with adequate strength  management of collisions with satellites and space debris  and lightning 
meo skyhook  as part of an afrl study  roger lenard proposed a meo skyhook  it appears that a gravity gradient-stabilized tether with its center of mass in meo can be constructed of available materials  the bottom of the skyhook is close to the atmosphere in a  non-keplerian orbit   a re-usable rocket can launch to match altitude and speed with the bottom of the tether which is in a non-keplerian orbit  travelling much slower than typical orbital speed   the payload is transferred and it climbs the cable  the cable itself is kept from de-orbiting via electric propusion and or electromagnetic effects 
launch     john powell has a concept for a   in a first-gen system  built into a mountain  accelerates a payload through an evacuated maglev track  a small on-board rocket circulizes the payload 
beamed energy launch 
and
both have
for ground-based irradiation of a mono-propellant launch vehicle using rf energy  the rf energy is absorbed and directly heats the propellant not unlike in nerva-style nuclear-thermal  lasermotive has a concept for a laser-based approach 
in fiction  
space stations transmitting solar power have appeared in science-fiction works like  s     1941   that centers around the troubles caused by
operating the station  asimov s short story    also features the use of sbsp to provide limitless energy for use on earth   s thriller
involves a billionaire bent on creating a solar powersat while others try to sabotage it 
in the video game   the player can construct a city improvement called an  orbital power transmitter  which  while expensive  provides energy to all other cities  constructing many of these results in huge bonuses to energy production for all cities the player owns  in the novel  skyfall   1976  by
an attempt to launch the core of powersat from cape canaveral ends in disaster when the launch vehicle fails trapping the payload in a decaying orbit  several
games have featured space-microwave power plants as buildable options for municipal energy  along with  unrealistic  disaster scenarios where the beam strays off the collector and sets fire to nearby areas  in the manga and anime   an orbital ring containing multiple solar collectors and microwave transmitters  along with power stations and space elevators for carrying power back down to earth s surface  are the primary source of electricity for the earth in the 24th century 
various aerospace companies have also showcased imaginative future solar power satellites in their corporate vision videos  including the boeing   lockheed martin s   and united launch alliance
