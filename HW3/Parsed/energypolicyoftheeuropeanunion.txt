although the
has legislated in the area of
for many years  the concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive european union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the informal
on 27 october 2005 at   the
of 2007 legally includes solidarity in matters of energy supply and changes to the energy policy within the eu  prior to the treaty of lisbon  eu energy legislation has been based on the eu authority in the area of the common market and environment  however  in practice many policy competencies in relation to energy remain at national member state level  and progress in policy at european level requires voluntary cooperation by members states 
in 2007  the eu was importing 82  of its
and 57  of its   which then made it the world s leading importer of these   only 3  of the
used in european nuclear reactors was
in europe  russia  canada  australia  niger and kazakhstan were the five largest suppliers of nuclear materials to the eu  supplying more than 75  of the total needs in 2009  in 2015  the eu imports 53  of the energy it consumes  in january 2014  the eu agreed to a 40  emissions reduction by 2030  compared to 1990 levels  and a 27  renewable energy target  the target is the most ambitious of any region in the world  and is expected to provide 70,000 full-time jobs and cut 33bn in fossil fuel imports 
in 2015  the framework strategy for energy union is launched as one of the european commission s 10 priorities 
contents
energy union  
the energy union strategy is a project of the
to coordinate the transformation of european energy supply  it was launched in february 2015  with the aim of providing secure  sustainable  competitive  affordable energy 
  president of the   introduced the idea of an energy union when he was prime minister of poland  eurocommissioner vice president
called the energy union the biggest energy project since the   the eu s reliance on russia for its energy  and the
have been cited as strong reasons for the importance of this policy 
the european council concluded on 19march 2015 that the eu is committed to building an energy union with a forward-looking climate policy on the basis of the commission s framework strategy  with five priority dimensions 
energy security  solidarity and trust
a fully integrated european
energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand
decarbonising the economy
research  innovation and competitiveness 
the strategy includes a minimum 10  electricity interconnection target for all member states by 2020  which the commission hopes will put downward pressure onto energy prices  reduce the need to build new power plants  reduce the risk of black-outs or other forms of
  improve the reliability of
  and encourage
 
earlier proposals  
the possible principles of energy policy for europe were elaborated at the commission s
a european strategy for sustainable  competitive and secure energy on 8 march 2006  as a result of the decision to develop a common energy policy  the first proposals  energy for a changing world were published by the   following a consultation process  on 10 january 2007 
it is claimed that they will lead to a  post-industrial revolution   or a   in the european union  as well as increased competition in the energy markets  improved security of supply  and improved employment prospects  the commission s proposals have been approved at a meeting of the
on 8 and 9 march 2007 
key proposals include 
a cut of at least 20  in
emissions from all
sources by 2020  compared to 1990 levels   while pushing for an international agreement to succeed the
aimed at achieving a 30  cut by all developed nations by 2020 
a cut of up to 95  in carbon emissions from primary energy sources by 2050  compared to 1990 levels 
a minimum target of 10  for the use of
by 2020 
that the energy supply and generation activities of energy companies should be  unbundled  from their distribution networks to further increase market competition 
improving energy relations with the eu s neighbours  including russia 
the development of a european strategic energy technology plan to develop technologies in areas including renewable energy       
and
 ccs  
developing an - energy partnership  to help africa  leap-frog  to low-carbon technologies and to help develop the continent as a sustainable energy supplier 
many underlying proposals are designed to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2c above pre-industrial levels  of which 0.8c has already taken place and another 0.50.7c is already   2c is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid     due to only minor efforts in global
it is highly likely that the world will not be able to reach this particular target  the eu might then not only be forced to accept a less ambitious global target  because the planned emissions reductions in the european energy sector  95  by 2050  are derived directly from the 2c target since 2007  the eu will have to revise its energy policy paradigm 
in 2014  negotiations about binding eu energy and climate targets until 2030 are set to start  european parliament voted in february 2014 in favour of binding 2030 targets on renewables  emissions and energy efficiency  a 40  cut in greenhouse gases  compared with 1990 levels  at least 30  of energy to come from renewable sources  and a 40  improvement in energy efficiency 
current policies  
set plan  
the
research program only reserved a moderate amount of funding for energy research  although energy has recently emerged as one of the key issues of the european union  a large part of fp7 energy funding is also devoted to
research  a technology that will not be able to help meet european climate and energy objectives until beyond 2050  the european commission tried to redress this shortfall with the set plan 
the steering group on the implementation of the strategic energy technologies plan  set plan  on 26 june 2008 will set the agenda for an eu energy technology policy  it will enhance the coordination of national and european research and innovation efforts to position the eu in the forefront of the
technologies markets

under the requirements of the   which entered into force in october 2001  the member states are expected to meet  indicative  targets for
production  although there is significant variation in national targets  the average is that 22  of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2010  compared to 13,9  in 1997   the european commission has proposed in its renewable energy roadmap21 a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the eu s overall mix from less than 7  today to 20  by 2020 
europe spent on importing
406 billion in 2011  bn  and 545 bn in 2012  this is around three times more than the cost of the
up to 2013  in 2012  wind energy avoided 9.6 billion  bn  of fossil fuel costs 
recommends binding renewable energy target to support in replacing fossil fuels with
by providing a stable regulatory framework  in addition  it recommends set a minimum emission performance standard for all new-build power installations

at the
in june 2007  the
acknowledged an eu proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency tabled in march 2007  and agreed to explore  together with the international energy agency  the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally  a year later  on 8 june 2008  the g8 countries  china  india  south korea and the european community decided to establish the international partnership for energy efficiency cooperation  at the energy ministerial meeting hosted by japan in the frame of the 2008 g8 presidency  in aomori 
buildings  
buildings account for around 40  of eu energy requirements and have been the focus of several initiatives  from 4 january 2006  the 2002
requires member states to ensure that new buildings  as well as large existing building undergoing refurbishment  meet certain minimum energy requirements  it also requires that all buildings should undergo  energy certification  prior to sale  and that
and
equipment should be regularly inspected 
as part of the eu s   aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behaviour  the boiler efficiency directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for
fired with liquid or gaseous fuels  originally  from june 2007  all homes  and other buildings  in the uk would have to undergo
before they are sold or let  to meet the requirements of the  
transport  
emissions from transport have risen rapidly in recent years  from 21  of the total in 1990 to 28  in 2004 
eu policies include the voluntary   signed in 1998  to cut carbon dioxide emissions for new cars sold in europe to an average of 140grams of co2 km by 2008  a 25  cut from the 1995 level  because the target was unlikely to be met  the european commission published new proposals in february 2007  requiring a mandatory limit of 130grams of co2 km for new cars by 2012  with  complementary measures  being proposed to achieve the target of 120grams of co2 km that had originally been expected 
in the area of fuels  the 2001
requires that 5,75  of all transport fossil fuels  petrol and   should be replaced by
by 31 december 2010  with an intermediate target of 2  by the end of 2005  in february 2007 the european commission proposed that  from 2011  suppliers will have to reduce
per unit of energy by 1  a year from 2010 levels  to result in a cut of 10  by 2020 stricter fuel standards to combat climate change and reduce air pollution 
flights  
airlines can be charged for their greenhouse gas emissions on flights to and from europe according to a court ruling in october 2011 
industry  
the   introduced in 2005 under the 2003 emission trading directive  sets national caps on
emissions for power plants and other large point sources 
consumer goods  
a further area of energy policy has been in the area of consumer goods  where
were introduced to encourage consumers to purchase more energy-efficient appliances 
external energy relations  
main article 
many eu members import oil and gas from russia 
beyond the bounds of the european union  eu energy policy has included negotiating and developing wider international agreements  such as the   the   the post-kyoto regime and a framework agreement on energy efficiency  extension of the ec energy regulatory framework or principles to neighbours     
energy cooperation  and the emission trading scheme to global partners  the promotion of research and the use of renewable energy 
the eu-russia energy cooperation will be based on a new comprehensive framework agreement within the post-  pca   which will be negotiated in 2007  the energy cooperation with other third energy producer and transit countries is facilitated with different tools  such as the pcas  the existing and foreseen memorandums of understanding on energy cooperation  with ukraine  azerbaijan  kazakhstan and algeria   the association agreements with mediterranean countries  the
action plans  euromed energy cooperation  the baku initiative  and the eu-norway energy dialogue  for the cooperation with african countries  a comprehensive africa-europe energy partnership would be launched at the highest level  with the integration of europe s energy and development policies 
for ensuring efficient follow-up and coherence in pursuing the initiatives and processes  for sharing information in case of an external energy crisis  and for assisting the eu s early response and reactions in case of energy security threats  the network of energy correspondents in the member states was established in early 2007  after the russian-ukrainian gas crisis of 2009 the eu decided that the existing external measures regarding gas supply security should be supplemented by internal provisions for emergency prevention and response  such as enhancing gas storage and network capacity or the development of the technical prerequisites for reverse flow in transit pipelines 
policies under development  
documents leaked in late-2016 reveal that a confidential
impact assessment analyzes four scenarios for paring back the  priority dispatch  system afforded to renewable generation in many countries  priority dispatch is mandated under the
which expires in 2020  the assessment concludes that removing priority dispatch could increase carbon emissions by 45million to 60million tonnes per annum or up to 10   with the aim of making european energy generators more flexible and cost-competitive 
solar anti-dumping levies  
the
imposed anti-dumping levies on chinese solar panel imports in june 2013  as reported earlier china was selling solar panels under production costs that made the operation without return also for the chinese solar power companies  chinese government guaranteed the operation of chinese solar power companies 
research and development  
the european union is also active in the areas of energy research  development and promotion  via initiatives such as
 ultra-low energy housing   and programs under the umbrella titles of save  energy saving 
 new and renewable energy sources  
 transport  and
 developing countries   through   the eu is participating in the
project 
public opinion  
in a poll carried out for the european commission in october and november 2005  47  of the citizens questioned in the 27 countries of the eu  including the 2 states that joined in 2007  were in favour of taking decisions on key energy policy issues at a european level  37  favoured national decisions and 8  that they be tackled locally 
a similar survey of 29,220 people in march and may 2006 indicated that the balance had changed in favour of national decisions in these areas  42  in favour   with 39  backing eu policy making and 12  preferring local decisions  there was significant national variation with this  with 55  in favour in the netherlands  but only 15  in finland 
a comprehensive public opinion survey was performed in may and june 2006  the authors propose following conclusions 
energy issues are considered to be important but not at first glance 
eu citizens perceive great future promise in the use of renewable energies  despite majority opposition  nuclear energy also has its place in the future  
citizens appear to opt for changing the energy structure  enhancing research and development and guaranteeing the stability of the energy field rather than saving energy as the way to meet energy challenges 
the possible future consequences of energy issues do not generate deep fears in europeans minds 
europeans appear to be fairly familiar with energy issues  although their knowledge seems somewhat vague 
energy issues touch everybody and it is therefore hard to distinguish clear groups with differing perceptions  nevertheless  rough distinction between groups of citizens is sketched
