dynamic demand is the name of a semi-passive technology for adjusting
on an electrical    it is also the name of an independent not-for-profit organization in the
supported by a charitable grant from the
dedicated to promoting this technology   the concept is that by monitoring the
of the power grid  as well as their own controls  intermittent domestic and industrial loads switch themselves on off at optimal moments to balance the overall grid load with generation  reducing critical power mismatches  as this switching would only advance or delay the appliance operating cycle by a few seconds  it would be unnoticeable to the end user  this is the foundation of dynamic demand control  in the united states  in 1982  a  now-lapsed  patent for this idea was issued to power systems engineer fred schweppe  other patents have been issued based on this idea 
dynamic demand is similar to
mechanisms to manage domestic and industrial consumption of electricity in response to supply conditions  for example  having electricity customers reduce their consumption at critical times or in response to prices  the difference is that dynamic demand devices passively shut off when stress in the grid is sensed  whereas demand response mechanisms respond to transmitted requests to shut off

is able to schedule just enough
in advance  any remaining imbalance would then be due either to inaccuracies in the prediction  or unscheduled changes in supply  such as a
fault  and or demand  such imbalances are removed by requesting generators to operate in so called frequency response mode  also called frequency control mode   altering their output continuously to keep the frequency near the required value 
the grid frequency is a system-wide indicator of overall power imbalance  for example  it will drop if there is too much demand because generators will start to slow down slightly  a
in frequency-response mode will  under
conditions  run at reduced output in order to maintain a buffer of spare capacity  it will then continually alter its output on a second-to-second basis to the needs of the grid with  
this
is a significant expense to the power utilities as often
must be burned or potential power sales lost to maintain it  the kind of generation used for fast response is usually
powered which produces emissions of between 0.48 and 1.3 tonnes of co2 equivalent for every
 mwh  generated  thus a significant environmental burden  in the form of increased
emissions  is associated with this imbalance

in principle  any
that operates to a
 such as industrial or domestic    
and   could be used to provide a constant and reliable grid balancing service by timing their duty cycles in response to system load 
because it is possible to measure grid frequency from any
on the grid  it is possible to design controllers for electrical appliances that detect any frequency imbalance in real time  dynamic-demand enabled appliances would react to this same signal  when the frequency decreases they would be more likely to switch off  reducing the load on the grid and helping to restore the balance  when the frequency increases past the standard  they would be more likely to switch on  using up the excess power  obviously  the
must also ensure that at no point does the appliance stray out of its acceptable operating range  as
is directly related to the speed of rotation of
on the system  millions of such devices acting together would act like a huge  fast-reacting  
ancillary services  
the dynamic controller could also provide other   such as aiding the ability of a power grid to be brought back to service after a
 if programmed with that function  generally blackstarts are made more difficult because of the large number of
attempting to draw power simultaneously at start up when
are low  this causes huge
that trip local
delaying full system recovery  the dynamic controller could have these loads  wait their turn   as it were  until full power had been restored 
another vital balancing service is fast reserve which is the use of standby plant to replace possible lost generation  e g  due to a failed power generator or lost    by shedding load quickly while the running generators spin up  then switching back in to bring the frequency back to standard  dynamic controllers could spare the high cost of   also the fast response speed of this method would avoid possible
occurring 
the technology could also help facilitate greater use of generation from variable sources  like   demand-side techniques could be an efficient and cost-effective way to help integrate this resource onto the grid  in particular it would allow these sources to work in conjunction with virtual power reserves like municipal
to provide a reasonably predictable
capacity 
implementation issues  
dynamic demand devices have the potential to save considerable amounts of
by the services they provide  but before dynamic demand control can be widely incorporated regulation must be put in place to mandate installation on at least new appliances or an effective market mechanism must be created to reward installation of the technology fairly  one method contemplated is to enable the
that measures the electricity consumption also measure the grid frequency  and switch to a higher
if the frequency drops below a certain level  the monthly electricity bill will then say that so many hours  and so many   were on the regular tariff and a few hours on the short supply tariff  those consumers without smart demand management have to pay the extra cost  but those who install smart technologies that adapt to the short supply periods will save money 
on 1 march 2011  rltec launched its dynamic demand  frequency response service in hot water and hvac load devices distributed across one of the uks largest supermarket chains    this megawatt scale virtual power plant service provides commercial frequency regulating response to national grid in the uk  the company is now called open energi 
frequency service and reserve service  
main article 
the national grid in the uk already is a massive user of this technology at an industrial scale - up to 2 gw of load can be lost instantaneously by frequency sensitive relays switching off steelworks etc   which is matched over a 20-minute cycle by up to 2 gw of quite small emergency diesel generators  for a complete description of this complex system see for example  emergency diesel standby generators potential contribution to dealing with renewable energy sources intermittency and variability  - a talk by david andrews of wessex water who works closely with the uk national grid to provide this service  given at the open university seminar  coping with variability - integrating renewables into the electricity system  24 january 2006 
up to 5 gw of such diesel generation is used in france for similar purposes  but these technologies seem to be relatively unknown     there is no reason they should not be massively increased in scope    to cope with even the intermittence introduced by wind power 
uk government investigation  
in august 2007  the uk government published a report outlining what potential it sees for dynamic demand technology  the report stops short of recommending the government encourage its introduction  it lists a number of technical and economic barriers to its introduction and recommends these be investigated before the government encourage the use of dynamic demand  dynamic demand is one element of a wider government investigation into technologies that can cut greenhouse gas emissions 
however  in 2009 it was announced that domestic refrigerators are now being sold into the uk incorporating a dynamic load control system
