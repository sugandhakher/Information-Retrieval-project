critical appraisals
its a  lack of professional engagement  
who in 2006 completed future by design  a feature-length profile of jacque fresco says  that has hurt fresco the most  the real missing link in jacques world is having put jacque to work  gazecki says   its  exemplified when people say  well  show me some buildings hes built  and i dont mean the domes out in venus  i mean  lets see an office building  lets see a manufacturing plant  lets see a circular city  and thats where he should have been 30 years ago  he should have been applying his work  in the real world   but  hes not a collaborator  and i think thats why hes never had great public achievements 
fresco on fresco  when asked by a reporter why he has such difficulty actualizing his many ideas  fresco responded   because i can t get to anybody  
views on fresco
fresco s critical view of modern economics has been compared to  s concept of  the predatory phase in human development   according to an article in the journal of society and business review  grnborg has labeled other facets of fresco s ideology a   approach  
synergetics theorist  arthur coulter  calls fresco s city designs  organic  and  evolutionary   rather than revolutionary   coulter posits such cities as the answer to  s idea of achieving
for society 
hypothetical form of government
fresco describes his form of
in this way   the aims of the venus project have no parallel in history  not with communism  socialism  fascism or any other political ideology  this is true because cybernation is of recent origin  with this system  the system of financial influence and control will no longer exist  
scholar
has raised the
against a resource-based economy  in a resource-based economy  murphy claims there is no ability to calculate the availability and desirability of resources because the price mechanism is not utilized  addressing this aspect  another article in the   states criticism of  central plannings  computation problem applies to the ideas of fresco 
question of
the venus project states on its website states that it is not   nikolina olsen-rule  writing for the   supports this idea 
for most people  the promise of the project sounds like an unattainable utopia  but if you examine it more closely  there are surprisingly many scientifically founded arguments that open up an entire new world of possibilities  
morten grnborg  also of copenhagen institute for futures studies  points out the venus project is 
    this visionary idea of a future society has many characteristics in common with the utopia      the word utopia carries a double meaning  since in greek it can mean both the good place  eutopia  and the nonexisting place  outopia   a good place is precisely what fresco has devoted his life to describing and fighting for 
comments on fresco
notes   fresco s future may  of course  seem outmoded and his writings have been subject to critique for their fascistic undertones of order and similitude  but his contributions are etched in the popular psyche and his eco-friendly concepts continue to influence our present generation of progressive architects  city planners and designers  
fresco s work gained the attention of science fiction enthusiast and critic    fresco would later attract
animator    who worked with fresco to produce several computer renderings of his designs 
commenting on fresco  physicist    wrote that fresco inspired him toward a career in physical science
