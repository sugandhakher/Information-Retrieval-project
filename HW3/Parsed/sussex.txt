during the 5th and 6th centuries 
the earliest known usage of the term south saxons  latin  australes saxones  is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king    although the term may well have been in use for some time before that  the monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong  recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late

word suthsexia was used for sussex by dutch cartographer

climate  
the coastal resorts of sussex and neighbouring
are the sunniest places in the united kingdom  the coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas  sea breezes  blowing off the sea  tend to clear any cloud from the coast  most of sussex lies in

rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the south downs with 950mm  37in  of rainfall per year  the close proximity of sussex to
of europe  results in cold spells in winter and hot  humid weather in summer 
the climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea  which  because of its tendency to warm up slower than land  can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer  in the autumn months  the coast sometimes has higher temperatures  rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers  from january to march the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems 
in winter  the east winds can be as cold as further inland
