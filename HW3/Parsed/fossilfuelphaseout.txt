 which lead to respiratory illness  heart disease  and asthma  have resulted in 1.5 million premature deaths each year  mostly in the developing world where the non-fossil fuels wood and animal dung are used for cooking  jacobson has also said that soot from diesel engines  coal-fired power plants  and burning wood is a  bigger cause of global warming than previously thought  and is the major cause of the rapid melting of the arctic s sea ice  
in 2011  new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources  and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies are needed 
several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain  new epa initiatives targeting air toxics  coal ash  and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies  the use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny  with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions  concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants  particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages  events at the
have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term  further  cost estimates for  next generation  nuclear units continue to climb  and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees 
studies about fossil fuel phase-out  
in 2008 
and nine other scientists published a journal article titled  target atmospheric co2  where should humanity aim   which calls for a complete phase-out of coal power by 2030 
more recently james hansen  considered the father of climate change has stated that continued
threatens humanity s ability to avoid dangerous climate change  the letter  co-authored with other climate change experts declared  if we stay on the current path   he said   those are the consequences we ll be leaving to our children  the best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power  it s ready now  we need to take advantage of it   and  continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity s ability to avoid dangerous climate change  
also in 2008  pushker kharecha and james hansen published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric
 co2  levels  their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050  the authors describe the scenario as follows 
the second scenario  labeled coal phase-out  is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their co2 emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions  between 2025 and 2050 it is assumed that both developed and developing countries will linearly phase out emissions of co2 from coal usage  thus in coal phase-out we have global co2 emissions from coal increasing 2  per year until 2012  1  per year growth of coal emissions between 2013 and 2022  flat coal emissions for 20232025  and finally a linear decrease to zero co2 emissions from coal in 2050  these rates refer to emissions to the atmosphere and do not constrain consumption of coal  provided the co2 is captured and sequestered  oil and gas emissions are assumed to be the same as in the bau  business as usual  scenario 
kharecha and hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios  all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted  under the business as usual scenario  atmospheric co2 peaks at 563 parts per million  ppm  in the year 2100  under the four coal phase-out scenarios  atmospheric co2 peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter  the key implications of the study are as follows  a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming  actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas  and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as
and  
in the
and erec s energy  r evolution scenario  the world would eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2090 
in december 2015
and
released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across europe  their analysis derived from a database of 280 coal plants and included emissions data from official eu registries 
a september 2016 report by oil change international concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal  oil  and gas in currently working mines and fields  assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes  will take the world to just beyond the 2c limit contained in the 2015
and even further from the 1.5c goal  the report observes that  one of the most powerful climate policy levers is also the simplest  stop digging for more fossil fuels   5
in october 2016  the
 odi  and 11 other
released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity  the report concludes that  on the whole  building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer  moreover  wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost 
coal  
coal consumption trends 19802012 in the top five coal-consuming countries  us eia 
coal-fired power plants provide 45  of consumed electricity in the united states  this is the
near  
coal is one of the largest sources of energy  supplying 27 percent of the world s primary energy in 2006  coal also accounts for up to one-third of global carbon emissions    to decrease carbon emissions and thus possibly stop extreme climate change  some have called for coal to be phased out  climatologist james e  hansen said  we need a moratorium on coal now   with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades  
argues that globally coal has to be phased-out until about 2035  if the 2c target is taken seriously 
some nations have decreased their coal consumption thus far in the 21st century  the greatest reductions being in the united states  coal consumption reduced by 176 million metric tons per year over the period 2000-2012   canada  reduced by 21 million tons per year  and spain  20 million tons per year   other nations have increased their coal consumption in the same period  led by china  increased 2,263 million metric tons per year in the period 2000-2012   india  increased 367 million tons per year   and south korea  59 million tons per year   worldwide  coal consumption increased 60  during the period 2000-2012  as of 2012  1200 new coal power plants were reportedly being planned worldwide  most of them in china and india  however  coal consumption has peaked in china in 2013 or 2014  depending on the data used and fell in 2015 by 3.6   even though there was a growth of gdp of 6.9  
in the 2011-2013 period  the
group of western european countries has increased the use of coal  attributed largely to the low cost of coal and the high price of imported natural gas in western europe 
according to   the average coal plant emits more than 100 times as much radiation per year than does a comparatively sized nuclear power plant  in the form of fly ash 
some like the  coal advisory board  of the iea believe that coal should not be phased out  considering that longer-term global economic growth cannot be achieved without adequate and affordable energy supplies  which will require continuing significant contributions from fossil fuels including coal  in this viewpoint 
could reduce
emissions compatible with a low-emissions future  some environmentalists and climatologists support a phase-out and criticise clean coal as not a solution to   entrepreneurs promote improved regulations and modernised technology   
switch to natural gas  
some
such as the 1200 mw
have stopped burning coal by switching the plant to natural gas  according to the u s  energy information administration  27 gigawatts of capacity from coal-fired generators is to be retired from 175 us coal-fired power plants between 2012 and 2016  natural gas showed a corresponding jump  increasing by a third over 2011  coal s share of electricity generation dropped to just over 36   due to  
declined from 2009  natural gas accounted for 81  of new power generation in the us between 2000 and 2010  coal-fired generation puts out about twice the amount of carbon dioxide - around 2,000 pounds for every megawatt hour generated - than electricity generated by burning natural gas at 1,100 pounds of
per megawatt hour  as the fuel mix in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation  carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen  those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992  natural gas production and distribution leak
into the atmosphere which may be 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide 
legislation and initiatives to phase out coal  
major economies  
the twenty leaders of the world s top industrialized nations  as well as key countries with developing economies  have agreed to phase out their   including coal  in a concluding statement from the group of 20  g20  summitheld in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  on september 24 and 25  2009 the nations  leaders agreed to  phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies   the g20 leaders also called for targeted support for poor people that would be impacted by higher prices for fossil fuels  the leaders noted that  inefficient  fossil fuel subsidies  encourage wasteful consumption  reduce our energy security  impede investment in clean energy sources  and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change   the agreement will ultimately phase out nearly  300 billion in global subsidies for fossil fuels  and as noted in a white house fact sheet  the
and the
estimate that eliminating fossil fuel subsidies worldwide would cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 10  or more by 2050 
despite such pledges  a 2012 report by oil change international which analyzed 2011 spending by the world s wealthy nations found five times as much being spent on fossil fuel subsidies than climate aid   58 billion was spent in fossil fuel subsidies that year  as compared with  11 billion spent by such nations towards climate adaptation and mitigation in developing countries  with figures for the u s  at  13 billion in fossil fuel subsidies versus  2.5 billion in climate aid for 2011 
in november 2015 
countries announced another tightening of international coal subsidies 
australia  
electricity generation from renewable sources in australia  2010
the
party have proposed to phase out coal power stations  the nsw greens proposed an immediate moratorium on coal-fired power stations and want to end all coal mining and coal industry subsidies  the australian greens and the
also oppose nuclear power  the federal government and victorian state government want to modify existing coal-fired power stations into clean coal power stations    the federal labor government extended the   an initiative to ensure that new sources of electricity are more likely to be from wind power  solar power and other sources of  
is one of the largest consumers of coal per capita  and also the largest exporter  the proposals are strongly opposed by industry  unions and the main opposition party in parliament  now forming the party in government after the september 2013 election  
canada  
in 2005  canada annually burned 60 million tons of coal  mainly for electrical power  increasing by 15 percent annually 
ontario  
beginning in 2005  
planned coal phase-out legislation  ontario annually consumed 15 million tons of coal in large power plants to supplement nuclear power 
was a major source of air pollution  and ontario suffered  smog days  during the summer    in 2007  ontario s liberal government committed to phasing out all coal generation in the province by 2014  premier dalton mcguinty said   by 2030 there will be about 1,000 more new coal-fired generating stations built on this planet  there is only one place in the world that is phasing out coal-fired generation and we re doing that right here in ontario   the ontario power authority projects that in 2014  with no coal generation  the largest sources of electrical power in the province will be nuclear  57 percent   hydroelectricity  25 percent   and natural gas  11 percent   the final coal plant in ontario    stopped burning coal in april 2014 
china  
there are currently no plans to phase out coal burning power stations in the
on the national level 
chinas exceedingly high energy demand has pushed the demand for relatively cheap coal-fired power  each week  another 2gw of coal-fired power is put online in china  coal supplies about 80  of china s energy needs today  and that ratio is expected to continue  even as overall power usage grows rapidly  serious air quality deterioration has resulted from the massive use of coal and many chinese cities suffer severe smog events   
as a consequence the region of beijing has decided to phase out all its coal-fired power generation by the end of 2015 
in 2009 china had 172gw of installed hydro capacity the largest in the world  producing 16  of china s electricity  the eleventh five-year plan has set a 300gw target for 2020  china built the world s largest power plant of any kind  the  
in addition to the huge investments in coal power  china has 32 reactors under construction  the highest number in the world 
analysis in 2016 shows that china s coal consumption appears to have peaked in 2014 
european union  
in july 2014      heal 
and
published a report calling for the decommissioning of the thirty most polluting coal-fired power plants in europe 
germany  
3,500-4,000
blocking a coal mine to
   
mining has long been subsidized in germany  reaching a peak of 6.7billion in 1996 and dropping to 2.7billion in 2005 due to falling output  these subsidies represent a burden on public finances and imply a substantial   diverting funds away from other  more beneficial public investments 
in 2007 germany announced plans to phase out hard coal-industry subsidies by 2018  a move which is expected to end hard coal mining in germany  this exit is later than the eu-mandated end by 2014  solar and wind are major sources of energy and renewable energy generation  around 15  as of december 2013  and growing  coal is still the largest source of power in germany 
in 2007 german chancellor
and her party agreed to legislation to phase out germany s hard coal mining sector  that does not mean that they support phasing out coal in general  there were plans to build about 25 new plants in the coming years  most german coal power plants were built in the 1960s  and have a low energy efficiency  public sentiment against coal power plants is growing and the construction or planning of some plants has been stopped  a number are under construction and still being built  no concrete plan is in place to reduce coal-fired electricity generation  as of october 2015  the remaining coal plants still under planning include  niederaussem  profen  and stade  the coal plants currently under construction include  mannheim  hamm d  datteln  and willhelmshaven  between 2012 and 2015  six new plants went online  all of these plants are 6001800 mwe 
in 2014 germany s coal consumption dropped for the first time  having risen each year since the low during the 2009 recession 
a 2014 study finds that coal is not making a comeback in germany  as is sometimes claimed  rather renewables have more than offset the nuclear facilities that have been shutdown as a result of germany s
 atomausstieg   hard coal plants now face financial stringency as their operating hours are cut back by the market  but in contrast  -fired generation is in a safe position until the mid-2020s unless government policies change  to phase-out coal  germany should seek to strength the emissions trading system     consider a carbon tax  promote   and strengthen the use of natural gas as a bridge fuel 
in 2016 the german government and affected
power plant operators     and
reached an understanding  verstndigung  on the transfer of lignite power plant units into security standby  berfhrung von braunkohlekraftwerksblcken in die sicherheitsbereitschaft   as a result  eight lignite-fired power plants are to be mothballed and later closed  with the first plant scheduled to cease operation in october 2016 and the last in october 2019  the affected operators will receive state compensation for foregone profits  the
has declared government plans to use 1.6billion of public financing for this purpose to be in line with eu
rules 
a 2016 study finds that the phase-out of lignite in
 lausitz  by 2030 can be financed by future owner
in a manner that avoids taxpayer involvement  instead  liabilities covering decommissioning and land rehabilitation could be paid by eph directly into a foundation  perhaps run by the public company   the study calculates the necessary provisions at 2.6billion 
in november 2016 the german utility
announced it will be decommissioning five coal-fired generating units in
and
due to low wholesale electricity prices 
india  
coal production in   1959-2020
india is the third largest consumer of coal in the world  india s federal energy minister is planning to stop importing thermal coal by 2018  the annual report of india s power ministry has a plan to grow power by about 80gw as part of their 11th 5-year plan  and 79  of that growth will be in fossil fuelfired power plants  primarily coal  india plans four new  ultra mega  coal-fired power plants as part of that growth  each 4000mw in capacity  as of 2015 there are six nuclear reactors under construction  in the first half of 2016  the amount of coal-fired generating capacity in pre-construction planning in india fell by 40,000 mw  according to results released by the global coal plant tracker  in june 2016  india s ministry of power stated that no further power plants would be required in the next three years  and  any thermal power plant that has yet to begin construction should back off  
the netherlands  
on 22 september 2016 the dutch parliament voted for a 55  cut in co2 emissions by 2030  a move which would require the closure of the country s five coal-fired power plants  the vote is not binding on the government however 
new zealand  
in october 2007  the
government introduced a 10year moratorium on new fossil fuel thermal power generation  the ban was limited to state-owned utilities  although an extension to the private sector was considered  the
under mp
  
repealed this legislation   
in 2014  almost 80 per cent of the electricity produced in
was from   on 6 august 2015 
announced that it would close its two last  
south africa  
as of 2007  south africa s power sector is the 8th highest global emitter of co2  in 2005/2006  77  of south africa s energy demand was directly met by coal  and when current projects come online  this ratio will increase in the near term 
there are no plans to phase out coal-fired power plants in south africa  and indeed  the country is investing in building massive amounts of new coal-fired capacity to meet power demands  as well as modernizing the existing coal-fired plants to meet environmental requirements 
on april 6  2010  the world bank approved a  3.75b loan to south africa to support the construction of the world s 4th largest coal-fired plant  at medupi  the proposed world bank loan includes a relatively small amount -  260 million - for wind and solar power 
rated at 4800mw 
would join other mammoth coal-fired power plants already in operation in the country  namely
 4100mw  
 4100   and
 4000   as well as a similar-capacity   at 4800mw  currently under construction  kusile is expected to come online in stages  starting in 2012  while medupi is expected to first come online in 2013  with full capacity available by 2017  these schedules are provisional  and may change   
since 2008  south africa s government started funding
installations  as of january 2016  there have been 400 000 domestic installations in total  with free-of-charge installation of low-pressure solar water heaters for low-cost homes or low-income households which have access to the electricity grid  while other installations are subsidised 
united kingdom  
  from 3 october 2008  11 may 2010  announced that no new coal-fired power stations will be built in britain from 2009 onwards unless they capture and bury at least 25  of greenhouse gases immediately and 100  by 2025 although at the time this was a statement of intent rather than something he was able to enforce 
 energy secretary from 12 may 2010  5 february 2012  has confirmed that the legislation required to allow his office to enforce
are proceeding 
the uk is also subject to the eu s
covering non-co2 emissions which is expected to bring many older plants to a close over the next few years as they are too expensive to upgrade 
 energy secretary from 11 may 2015  announced on 18 november 2015 that all coal-fired power stations would close by 2025  this will not be a complete phase out of fossil fuels because new gas-fired power stations will replace them

us electrical generation  fossil fuels vs  nuclear and renewable energy
in 2007  154 new coal-fired plants were on the drawing board in 42 states  by 2012  that had dropped to 15  mostly due to new rules limiting mercury emissions  and limiting carbon emissions to 1,000 pounds of co2 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced 
in july 2013  us secretary of energy
outlined obama administration policy on fossil fuels 
in the last four years  weve more than doubled renewable energy generation from wind and solar power  however  coal and other fossil fuels still provide 80 percent of our energy  70 percent of our electricity  and will be a major part of our energy future for decades  thats why any serious effort to protect our kids from the worst effects of climate change must also include developing  demonstrating and deploying the technologies to use our abundant fossil fuel resources as cleanly as possible 
then-us energy secretary
and researchers for the us
have noted that greater electrical generation by non- renewables  such as wind and solar  will also increase the need for flexible natural gas-powered generators  to supply electricity during those times when solar and wind power are unavailable  gas-powered generators have the ability to ramp up and down quickly to meet changing loads

maine  
on april 15  2008 
governor
signed ld 2126   an act to minimize carbon dioxide emissions from new coal-powered industrial and electrical generating facilities in the state   the law  which was sponsored by rep  w  bruce macdonald  d-   requires the board of environmental protection to develop greenhouse gas emission standards for coal gasification facilities  it also puts a moratorium in place on building any new coal gasification facilities until the standards are developed 
oregon  
in early march 2016  oregon lawmakers approved a plan to stop paying for out-of-state coal plants by 2030 and require a 50 percent renewable energy standard by 2040  environmental groups such as the
and leading democrats praised the bill 
texas  
in 2006 a coalition of
groups organized a campaign in favor of a statewide moratorium on new coal-fired power plants  the campaign culminated in a  stop the coal rush  mobilization  including rallying and lobbying  at the state capital in
on february 11 and 12th  2007  over 40 citizen groups supported the mobilization 
in january  2007  a resolution calling for a 180-day moratorium on new pulverized coal plants was filed in the texas legislature by state rep 
 r-waco  as house concurrent resolution 43  the resolution was left pending in committee  on december 4  2007  rep  anderson announced his support for two proposed

washington state  
has followed the same approach as california  prohibiting coal plants whose emissions would exceed those of natural gas plants  substitute senate bill 6001  ssb 6001   signed on may 3  2007  by governor   enacted the standard  as a result of ssb 6001  the
in kalama was rejected by the state  however  a new plant proposal  the   shows the limits of the  natural gas equivalency  approach as a means of prohibiting new coal plants  the proposed plant would meet the standard set by ssb 6001 by capturing and sequestering a portion  65 percent  according to a plant spokesman  of its carbon 
utility action in the us  
announced on june 1  2007  that it was beginning a two-year moratorium on proposals for new coal-fired power plants while it undertook more aggressive efficiency and conservation programs  the company added   additional reductions in future electricity demand growth through energy efficiency could push the need for new power plants farther into the future  
concluded in its november 2007 resource plan   in sum  in light of the now likely regulation of co2 emissions in the future due to broader interest in climate change issues  the increased costs of constructing new coal facilities  and the increased risk of timely permitting to meet planned in-service dates  public service does not believe it would not be prudent to consider at this time any proposals for new coal plants that do not include co2 capture and sequestration 
noted in its 2007 resource plan that  given the likelihood of future carbon regulation  we have only modeled a future coal-based resource option that includes carbon capture and storage  
announced in december 2007 that it would not consider a new coal resource without a carbon solution 
announced that it does not anticipate pursuing coal-fired power plants in the foreseeable future 
announced on december 17  2007  that it planned to double its wind power capacity over the next seven years and steer away from new baseload coal plants  the plans are detailed in the company s 2007 montana electric supply resource plan 
 cec  has initiated its review of two 53.4-megawatt solar thermal power plants that will each include a 40-megawatt biomass power plant to supplement the solar power 
public support for a coal moratorium  

those corporations that continue to invest in new fossil fuel exploration  new fossil fuel exploitation  are really in flagrant breach of their fiduciary duty because the science is abundantly clear that this is something we can no longer do

the authors of the poll reported   75 percent of americansincluding 65 percent of republicans  83 percent of democrats and 76 percent of independentswould  support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the united states if there was stepped-up investment in clean  safe renewable energysuch as wind and solarand improved home energy-efficiency standards   women  80 percent  were more likely than men  70 percent  to support this idea  support also was higher among college graduates  78 percent  than among those who did not graduate from high school  68 percent  
the exact question posed by the survey was as follows  more than half of power plant-generated electricity comes from coal  experts say that power plants are responsible for about 40 percent of u s  carbon dioxide pollution linked to global warming  there are plans to build more than 150 new coal-fired power plants over the next several years  would you support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the united states if there was stepped-up investment in clean  safe and renewable energysuch as wind and solarand improved home energy-efficiency standards  would you say definitely yes  probably yes  probably no  definitely no  or don t know 
the results were as follows 
30   definitely yes 
45   probably yes 
13   probably no 
8   definitely no 
4   don t know 
gallup  
in 2013  the gallup organization determined that 41  of americans wanted less emphasis placed on coal energy  versus 31  who wanted more  large majorities wanted more emphasis placed on solar  76    wind  71    and natural gas  65   
abc news washington post  
a 2009 abc washington post poll found 52  of americans favored more coal mining  33  strongly favored   while 45  opposed  27  strongly opposed   the most support was for wind and solar  which were favored by 91   79  strongly favored  
clean call to action  
in october  2007  fifteen groups led by
 clean  called for a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants  with no exception for plants sequestering carbon  the groups included save our cumberland mountains  tennessee   ohio valley environmental council  west virginia   cook inlet keeper  alaska   christians for the mountains  west virginia   coal river mountain watch  west virginia   kentuckians for the commonwealth  kentucky   civil society institute  massachusetts   clean power now  massachusetts   indigenous environmental network  minnesota   castle mountain coalition  alaska   citizens action coalition  indiana   appalachian center for the economy   the environment  west virginia   appalachian voices  nc   and rhode island wind alliance  rhode island  
environmental defense fund  
the us-based
 edf  has taken a stand in favor of natural gas production and   while pressing for stricter environmental controls on gas drilling  as a feasible way to replace coal  the organization has funded studies jointly with the petroleum industry on the environmental effects of natural gas production  the organization sees natural gas as a way to quickly replace coal  and that natural gas in time will be replaced by renewable energy  the policy has been criticized by some environmentalists  edf counsel and blogger mark brownstein answered 
demand for natural gas is not going away  and neither is hydraulic fracturing  we must be clear-eyed about this  and fight to protect public health and the environment from unacceptable impacts  we must also work hard to put policies in place that ensure that natural gas serves as an enabler of renewable power generation  not an impediment to it  we fear that those who oppose all natural gas production everywhere are  in effect  making it harder for the u s  economy to wean itself from dirty coal

a wind farm is a group of
in the same location used to produce electric power  a large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines  and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles  but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes  a wind farm may also be located offshore 
wind power has grown dramatically since 2005 and by 2013 supplied almost 1  of global energy consumption 
many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the united states and china  the
in china has over 5,000 mw installed with a goal of 20,000 mw by 2020  china has several other  wind power bases  of similar size  the
in   united states is the largest onshore wind farm outside of china  with a capacity of 1020

is a
photovoltaic project which is under construction in the antelope valley area of the western mojave desert  and due to be completed in 2013 
many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems  solar power plants have no fuel costs or emissions during operation 
concentrated solar power  
the 150 mw
is a commercial
power plant  located in   the andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isn t shining

toward biomass  
is
from living  or recently living organisms  most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials  as a   biomass can either be used directly  or indirectlyonce or converted into another type of energy product such as   biomass can be converted to energy in three ways  thermal conversion  chemical conversion  and biochemical conversion 
using biomass as a fuel produces
in the form of    
 nitrogen oxides   vocs     particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as
or
in some cases  such as with indoor heating and cooking   utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications 
 a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels  biofuels  and biomass  is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming  5657 in 2009 a swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in south asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning  and to a lesser extent by fossil fuel burning 
has increased the use of biomass and garbage  and decreased the use of coal 
energy efficiency  
main article 
moving away from fossil fuels will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied  but in the way it is used  and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential  opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side  and often offer significant economic benefits 
a sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency  renewable energy and
are said to be the  twin pillars  of
policy 
has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use  if energy use grows too fast  renewable energy development will chase a receding target  likewise  unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly  slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions  reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed 
the iea has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future  and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation 
nuclear energy  
the 2014
report identifies nuclear energy as one of the technologies that can provide electricity with less than 5  of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power  there are more than 60 nuclear reactors shown as under construction in the list of
with china leading at 23  globally  more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased  china has stated its plans to double nuclear generation by 2030  india also plans to greatly increase its nuclear power 
several countries have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations  several european countries have debated
and others have completely shut down some reactors  three
have influenced the slowdown of nuclear power  the 1979
in the united states  the 1986
in the ussr  and the 2011
in japan  following the march 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster  germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022  italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear  switzerland and spain have banned the construction of new reactors  japans prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in japans reliance on nuclear power  taiwans president did the same    the new prime minister of japan since december 2012  announced a plan to restart some of the 54 japanese nuclear power plants and to continue some nuclear reactors under construction 
as of 2016  countries such as             and
have no nuclear power stations and remain opposed to nuclear power     
and
are phasing-out their nuclear power
