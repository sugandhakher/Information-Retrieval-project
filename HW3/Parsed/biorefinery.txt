biorefinery
from wikipedia  the free encyclopedia
jump to 					 
a biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels  power  heat  and value-added chemicals from   the biorefinery concept is analogous to today s   which produce multiple fuels and products from  
the
bioenergy task 42 on biorefineries has defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products  food  feed  chemicals  materials  and bioenergy  biofuels  power and or heat  
by producing multiple products  a biorefinery takes advantage of the various components in biomass and their intermediates therefore maximizing the value derived from the biomass feedstock  a biorefinery could  for example  produce one or several low-volume  but high-value  chemical or
products and a low-value  but high-volume liquid transportation fuel such as

 chp  technology  for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the local utility  the high-value products increase profitability  the high-volume fuel helps meet energy needs  and the power production helps to lower energy costs and reduce
emissions from traditional power plant facilities  although some facilities exist that can be called bio-refineries  the bio-refinery has yet to be fully realized  future biorefineries may play a major role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced from
