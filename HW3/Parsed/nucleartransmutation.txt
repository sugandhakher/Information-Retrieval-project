nuclear transmutation is the conversion of one
or an
into another    because any element  isotope  is defined by its number of
 and   in its   i e  in the   nuclear transmutation occurs in any process where this number is changed 
a transmutation can be achieved either by
 in which an outside particle reacts with a nucleus  or by
 where no outside particle is needed

natural and artificial transmutation  
although all transmutation is caused by either decay or nuclear reaction  not all of these processes cause transmutation  e g    
do not transmute the affected atom 
natural transmutation by
in the past created most of the heavier chemical elements in the universe  see the corresponding section below 
one type of natural transmutation observable in the present occurs when certain
elements present in nature spontaneously decay by a process that causes transmutation  such as
or   an example is the natural decay of
to   which forms most of the
in air  also on earth  natural transmutations from the different mechanism of natural
occur  due to
bombardment of elements  for example  to form    and also occasionally from natural neutron bombardment  for example  see   
artificial transmutation may occur in machinery that has enough energy to cause changes in the nuclear structure of the elements  such machines include
and
reactors  conventional
also cause artificial transmutation  not from the power of the machine  but by exposing elements to
produced by fission from an artificially produced   for instance  when a uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons  fission takes place  this releases  on average  3 neutrons and a large amount of energy  the released neutrons then cause fission of other uranium atoms  until all of the available uranium is exhausted  this is called a chain reaction 
artificial nuclear transmutation has been considered as a possible mechanism for reducing the volume and hazard of  
history  
alchemy  
the term transmutation dates back to   alchemists pursued the   capable of
 the transformation of
into gold  while alchemists often understood chrysopoeia as a metaphor for a mystical  or religious process  some practitioners adopted a literal interpretation  and tried to make gold through physical experiment  the impossibility of the metallic transmutation had been debated amongst alchemists  philosophers and scientists since the middle ages  pseudo-alchemical transmutation was outlawed and publicly mocked beginning in the fourteenth century  alchemists like
and
wrote tracts exposing fraudulent claims of gold making  by the 1720s  there were no longer any respectable figures pursuing the physical transmutation of substances into gold    in the 18th century  replaced the
with the modern theory of chemical elements  and
further developed the notion of atoms  from the alchemical theory of   to explain various chemical processes  the disintegration of atoms is a distinct process involving much greater energies than could be achieved by alchemists 
modern physics  
it was first consciously applied to modern physics by
when he  along with   discovered that radioactive
was converting itself into
in 1901  at the moment of realization  soddy later recalled  he shouted out   rutherford  this is transmutation   rutherford snapped back   for christ s sake  soddy  don t call it transmutation  they ll have our heads off as alchemists  
rutherford and soddy were observing natural transmutation as a part of
of the
type  however in 1919  rutherford was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen into   using alpha particles directed at nitrogen 14n    
  p  this was the first observation of a   that is  a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus  eventually  in 1932  a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by rutherford s colleagues
and   who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7 to split the nucleus into two alpha particles  the feat was popularly known as  splitting the atom   although it was not the modern
reaction discovered in 1938 by  
and their assistant fritz strassmann in heavy elements 
later in the twentieth century the transmutation of elements within stars was elaborated  accounting for the relative abundance of heavier elements in the universe  save for the first five elements  which were produced in the big bang and other
processes  stellar nucleosynthesis accounted for the abundance of all elements heavier than boron  in their 1957 paper         and
explained how the abundances of essentially all but the lightest chemical elements could be explained by the process of
in stars 
it transpired that  under true nuclear transmutation  it is far easier to turn gold into lead than the reverse reaction  which was the one the alchemists had ardently pursued  nuclear experiments have successfully transmuted lead into gold  but the expense far exceeds any gain  it would be easier to convert gold into lead via
and
by leaving gold in a nuclear reactor for a long period of time 
  but at a net loss

transmutation in the universe  
main article 
the
is thought to be the origin of the hydrogen  including all   and helium in the universe  hydrogen and helium together account for 98  of the mass of ordinary matter in the universe  the big bang also produced small amounts of  
and perhaps   more lithium  beryllium and boron were produced later  in a natural nuclear reaction   
is responsible for all of the other elements occurring naturally in the universe as
and   from
to   these occurred after the big bang  during star formation  some lighter elements from carbon to iron were formed in stars and released into space by
 agb  stars  these are a type of red giant that  puffs  off its outer atmosphere  containing some elements from carbon to nickel and iron  all elements with
greater than 64
are produced in
stars by means of nuclear reaction of lighter nuclei called   which sub-divides into two processes 
and  
the
is thought to have condensed approximately 4.6 billion years before the present  from a cloud of hydrogen and helium containing heavier elements in dust grains formed previously by a large number of such stars  these grains contained the heavier elements formed by transmutation earlier in the history of the universe 
all of these natural processes of transmutation in stars are continuing today  in our own galaxy and in others  for example  the observed light curves of supernova stars such as
show them blasting large amounts  comparable to the mass of earth  of radioactive nickel and cobalt into space  however  little of this material reaches earth  most natural transmutation on the earth today is mediated by
 such as production of   and by the radioactive decay of radioactive
left over from the initial formation of the solar system  such as   uranium and thorium   plus the radioactive decay of products of these nucleides  radium  radon  polonium  etc    see  
artificial transmutation of nuclear waste  
overview  
transmutation of
 trus  i e 
minus
to   such as the
of
 about 1wt  in the   used   or the minor actinides  mas  i e      and   about 0.1wt  each in lwrs  unf  has the potential to help solve some problems posed by the management of
by reducing the proportion of long-lived isotopes it contains   this does not rule-out the need for a deep geological repository  dgr  for high radioactive level waste  hlw    when irradiated with
in a   these isotopes can undergo   destroying the original
isotope and producing a spectrum of radioactive and nonradioactive  
ceramic targets containing actinides can be bombarded with neutrons to induce transmutation reactions to remove the most difficult long-lived species  these can consist of actinide-containing solid solutions such as  am zr n   am y n   zr cm o2   zr cm am o2   zr am y o2 or just actinide phases such as amo2  npo2  npn  amn mixed with some inert phases such as mgo  mgal2o4   zr y o2  tin and zrn  the role of non-radioactive inert phases is mainly to provide stable mechanical behaviour to the target under neutron irradiation 
reactor types  
for instance  plutonium can be reprocessed into
and transmuted in standard reactors  the heavier elements could be transmuted in   but probably more effectively in a subcritical reactor which is sometimes known as an
and which was devised by  
have also been proposed as well suited 
fuel types  
there are several fuels that can incorporate plutonium in their initial composition at beginning of cycle  boc  and have a smaller amount of this element at the end of cycle  eoc   during the cycle  plutonium can be burnt in a power reactor  generating electricity  this process is not only interesting from a power generation standpoint  but also due to its capability of consuming the surplus weapons grade plutonium from the weapons program and plutonium resulting of
unf 
is one of these  its blend of oxides of plutonium and uranium constitutes an alternative to the low enriched uranium  leu  fuel predominantly used in lwrs  since uranium is present in mox  although plutonium will be burnt  second generation plutonium will be produced through the radiative capture of u-238 and the two subsequent beta minus decays 
fuels with plutonium and thorium are also an option  in these  the neutrons released in the fission of plutonium are captured by th-232  after this radiative capture  th-232 becomes th-233  which undergoes two beta minus decays resulting in the production of the fissile isotope u-233  the radiative capture cross section for th-232 is more than three times that of u-238  yielding a higher conversion to fissile fuel than that from u-238  due to the absence of uranium in the fuel  there is no second generation plutonium produced  and the amount of plutonium burnt will be higher than in mox fuels  however  u-233  which is fissile  will be present in the unf  weapons-grade and reactor-grade plutonium can be used in plutonium-thorium fuels  with weapons-grade plutonium being the one that shows a bigger reduction in the amount of pu-239 
reasoning behind transmutation  
isotopes of plutonium and other actinides tend to be long-lived with
of many thousands of years  whereas radioactive fission products tend to be shorter-lived  most with half-lives of 30 years or less   from a waste management viewpoint  transmutation  or  burning  or  incineration   of actinides eliminates a very long-term radioactive hazard and replaces it with a much shorter-term one 
it is important to understand that the threat posed by a radioisotope is influenced by many factors including the
 e g  heat -infrared photon radiation-  which is an advantage for the storage or disposal af radioactive waste  
and
properties of the element  for instance
has a relatively short
 1 to 4 months  while
and
both have very long biological half-lives  as a result
and radium are much more able to cause harm than
when a given activity is ingested  insert a brief calculation of doses  
many of the actinides are very radiotoxic because they have long biological half-lives and are
emitters  in transmutation the intention is to convert the actinides into   the fission products are very radioactive  but the majority of the activity will decay away within a short time  the most worrying short-lived fission products are those that accumulate in the body  such as -131 which accumulates in the thyroid gland  but it is hoped   that by good design of the nuclear fuel and transmutation plant that such fission products can be isolated from humans and their environment and allowed to decay  in the medium term the fission products of highest concern are strontium-90 and caesium-137  both have a half-life of about 30 years  the caesium-137 is responsible for the majority of the external
dose experienced by workers in
plants and  in 2005  to workers at the
site  when these medium-lived isotopes have decayed almost completely  usually after 10 half-lives  the remaining isotopes will pose a much smaller threat

some radioactive fission products can be converted into shorter-lived radioisotopes by transmutation  transmutation of all fission products with half-life greater than one year is studied in grenoble  with varying results 
and   with half-lives of about 30 years  are the largest radiation  including heat  emitters in used nuclear fuel on a scale of decades to  305 years  sn-121m is insignificant because of the low yield   and are not easily transmuted because they have low
  instead  they should simply be stored until they decay  given that this length of storage is necessary  the fission products with shorter half-lives can also be stored until they decay 
the next longer-lived fission product is   which has a half-life of 90 years  and is such a good neutron absorber that most of it is transmuted while the nuclear fuel is still being used  however  effectively transmuting the remaining sm-151 in nuclear waste would require separation from other isotopes of   given the smaller quantities and its low-energy radioactivity  sm-151 is less dangerous than sr-90 and cs-137 and can also be left to decay for  970 years 
finally  there are 7   they have much longer half-lives in the range 211,000 years to 15.7 million years  two of them 
and   are mobile enough in the environment to be potential dangers  are free or mostly free of mixture with stable isotopes of the same element  and have neutron cross sections that are small but adequate to support transmutation  also  tc-99 can substitute for
in supplying
for negative feedback for reactor stability  most studies of proposed transmutation schemes have assumed     and trus as the targets for transmutation  with other fission products    and possibly
remaining as waste 
of the remaining 5 long-lived fission products   
and
are produced only in small quantities  at least in today s   -burning   and the last two should be relatively inert  the other two 
and   are produced in larger quantities  but also not highly mobile in the environment  they are also mixed with larger quantities of other isotopes of the same element
