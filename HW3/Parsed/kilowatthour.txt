one watt second is equal to one joule  one kilowatt-hour is 3.6  which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour 
the base unit of energy within the
 si  is the   the hour is a unit of time  outside the si   making the kilowatt hour a non-si unit of energy  the kilowatt hour is not listed among the
by the
for use with the si  although the hour  from which the kilowatt hour is derived  is 
examples  
an electric heater rated at 1000 watts  1 kilowatt   operating for one hour uses one kilowatt hour  equivalent to 3.6 megajoules  of energy  a television rated at 100 watts operating for 10 hours continuously uses one kilowatt hour  a 40-watt light bulb operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatt hour 
electrical energy is sold in kilowatt hours  cost of running equipment is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours and price per kilowatt hour  the
of electricity may depend upon the rate of consumption and the time of day  industrial users may also have extra charges according to their peak usage and the  
symbol and abbreviations for kilowatt hour  
the symbol  kwh  is commonly used in commercial  educational  scientific and media publications  and is the usual practice in electrical power engineering 
other abbreviations and symbols may be encountered 
 kw h  is less commonly used  it is consistent with
standards  but note that the kilowatt-hour is a non-si unit   the international standard for si states that in forming a compound unit symbol   multiplication must be indicated by a space or a half-high  centered  dot     since otherwise some prefixes could be misinterpreted as a unit symbol   i e   kw h or kwh   this is supported by a voluntary standard issued jointly by an international    and national    organization  however  at least one major usage guide and the ieee astm standard allow  kwh   but do not mention other multiples of the watt hour   one guide published by
specifically recommends avoiding  kwh   to avoid possible confusion  
 kwh  is  like  kw h   preferred with si standards  but it is very rarely used in practice 
the us official fuel-economy window sticker for electric vehicles uses the abbreviation  kw-hrs  
variations in capitalization are sometimes seen  kwh  kwh  kwh  etc  these are inconsistent with international system of units 
the notation  kw h   as a symbol for kilowatt-hour  is not correct

watt hour multiples and billing units   
further information 
the kilowatt hour is commonly used by electrical distribution providers for purposes of billing  since the monthly energy consumption of a typical residential customer ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand kilowatt hours  megawatt hours  mwh   gigawatt hours  gwh   and terawatt hours  twh  are often used for metering larger amounts of electrical energy to industrial customers and in power generation  the terawatt hour and petawatt hour  pwh  units are large enough to conveniently express the

confusion of kilowatt hours  energy  and kilowatts  power   
the terms
and
are frequently confused  power is defined as the rate of delivery of energy  the work performed per unit time  measured in units joules per second or watts  to produce power over any period of time requires energy  either higher levels of power for a given period or longer periods of run time at a given power level require more energy 
an electrical load  e g  a lamp  tv-set  electric motor  has a rated size in watts  this is its running power level  which equates to the instantaneous rate at which energy must be generated and consumed to run the device  the amount of energy that is consumed at that rate depends on how long the device is operated  however  its power requirements are constant while running  the unit of energy for residential electrical billing  kilowatt hours  integrates changing power levels in use at the residence over the past billing period  which is nominally 720 hours for a 30-day month  thus showing cumulative electrical energy use for the month 
for another example  when a light bulb with a power rating of 100 watts is turned on for one hour  the energy used is 100 watt hours  wh   0.1 kilowatt hour  or 360 kilojoules  this same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5 hours  or a 10-watt low-energy bulb for 10 hours  a power station electricity output at any particular moment would be measured in multiples of watts  but its annual energy sales would be in multiples of watt hours  a kilowatt hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour  or 3.6  
energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example  a 100-watt  i e  0.1 kilowatt  light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800wh or 0.8kwh  if the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatt hour  it would cost 0.1kw  8h   0.25 kwh    0.20 
whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatt hours consumed  commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption  the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time  such as 15 minutes  this compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power  these charges are billed as demand charges 
major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours  twh  for a given period that is often a
or   one terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year 
misuse of watts per hour  
power units measure the rate of energy per unit time  many compound units for rates explicitly mention units of time  for example  miles per hour  kilometers per hour  dollars per hour  kilowatt-hours are a product of power and time  not a rate of change of power with time  watts per hour  w h  is a unit of a change of power per hour  it might be used to characterize the ramp-up behavior of   for example  a power plant that reaches a power output of 1mw from 0mw in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4mw h 
power plants have a very high ramp-up rate  which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations 
the proper use of terms such as watts per hour is uncommon  whereas misuse may be widespread 
other energy-related units  
several other units are commonly used to indicate power or energy capacity or use in specific application areas 
average annual power production or consumption can be expressed in kilowatt hours per year  for example  when comparing the energy efficiency of household appliances whose power consumption varies with time or the season of the year  or the energy produced by a distributed power source  one kilowatt hour per year equals about 114.08
applied constantly during one year 
the energy content of a
is usually expressed indirectly by its capacity in   to convert watt hours  wh  to ampere hour  ah   the watt-hour value must be divided by the voltage of the power source  this value is approximate  since the voltage is not constant during discharge of a battery  and because higher discharge rates reduce the total amount of energy the battery can provide  in the case of devices that output a different voltage than the battery  it is the battery voltage  typically 3.7 for   that must be used to calculate rather than the device output  usually 5.0 for
portable chargers   since use of the lower figure allows manufacturers of such devices to
the capacity or run-time  inflating it by 35   53.7 1.35   this results in a 500ma usb device running for only about 3.7 hours on a 2500mah battery  rather than the expected five hours 
the board of trade unit  botu  is an obsolete uk synonym for kilowatt hour  the term derives from the name of the
which regulated the electricity industry until 1942 when the
took over  the b o t u  should not be confused with the
or btu  which is a much smaller quantity of thermal energy 
in india  the kilowatt hour is often simply called a unit of energy  a million units  designated mu  is a gigawatt hour and a bu  billion units  is a terawatt hour 
of
is normally quoted in megawatt days per tonne  mwd mtu   where tonne refers to a metric ton of uranium metal or its equivalent  and megawatt refers to the entire thermal output  not the fraction which is converted to electricity
