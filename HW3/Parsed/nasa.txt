from 1946  the
 naca  had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic   in the early 1950s  there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the
 195758   an effort for this was the american   after the
launch of the world s first artificial

and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures  this led to an agreement that a new federal agency mainly based on naca was needed to conduct all non-military activity in space  the
 arpa  was created in february 1958 to develop space technology for military application 
on july 29  1958  eisenhower signed the   establishing nasa  when it began operations on october 1  1958  nasa absorbed the 43-year-old naca intact  its 8,000 employees  an annual budget of us 100million  three major research laboratories      and   and two small test facilities  a
was approved by president eisenhower in 1959  elements of the

capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-soviet   some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects  such as the galileo probe  which was deployed by astronauts in earth orbit before being sent unmanned to jupiter 
manned programs
the experimental
programs started by naca were extended by nasa as support for manned spaceflight  this was followed by a one-man
program  and in turn by a two-man capsule program  reacting to loss of national prestige and
fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the   in 1961 president
proposed the ambitious goal  of landing a man on the moon by the end of  the 1960s   and returning him safely to the earth   this goal was met in 1969 by the   and nasa planned even more ambitious activities leading to a   however  reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans  nasa turned its attention to an apollo-derived temporary space laboratory  and a semi-reusable earth orbital shuttle  in the 1990s  funding was approved for nasa to develop a permanent earth orbital
in cooperation with the international community  which now included the former rival  post-soviet   to date  nasa has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets  and thirteen
rocket flights above the
definition of spaceflight altitude  260,000 feet  80km

were issued on december 30  1954 for the airframe  and february 4  1955 for the rocket engine  the airframe contract was awarded to
in november 1955  and the xlr30 engine contract was awarded to
in 1956  and three planes were built  the x-15 was

twelve pilots were selected for the program from the air force  navy  and naca  later nasa   a total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968  resulting in the
for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft  current as of 2014   and a maximum speed of mach 6.72  4,519 miles per hour  7,273km h   the altitude record for x-15 was 354,200 feet  107.96km   eight of the pilots were awarded air force
for flying above 260,000 feet  80km   and two flights by
exceeded 100 kilometers  330,000ft   qualifying as spaceflight according to the   the x-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later manned spaceflight programs  including
jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft    and horizon definition for navigation  the

shortly after the
began  an early objective was to get a person into earth orbit as soon as possible  therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored  the us air force s
program considered many manned spacecraft designs  ranging from rocket planes like the x-15  to small ballistic   by 1958  the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule 
when nasa was created that same year  the air force program was transferred to it and renamed project mercury  the

apollo 11  buzz aldrin on the moon  1969
the u s public s perception of the soviet lead in the space race  by putting the first man in space  motivated president
to ask the congress on may 25  1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s  which effectively launched the  
apollo was one of the most expensive american scientific programs ever  it cost more than  20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated  206billion in present-day us dollars   in comparison  the
cost roughly  26.3billion  accounting for inflation   it used the
as launch vehicles  which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects  the spacecraft was also bigger  it had two main parts  the combined command and service module  csm  and the lunar landing module  lm   the lm was to be left on the moon and only the command module  cm  containing the three astronauts would eventually return to earth 
the second manned mission    brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the moon in december 1968  shortly before  the soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the moon  on the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the moon landing were practiced and then finally the moon landing was made on the
mission in july 1969 
apollo 17    1972
the first
was   who was followed by   while
orbited above  five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon  the last in december 1972  throughout these six apollo spaceflights  twelve men walked on the moon  these missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms  842lb  of lunar samples  topics covered by experiments performed included             and   the moon landing marked the end of the space race  and as a gesture  armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the moon 
apollo set major
in human spaceflight  it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond   and landing humans on another  
was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body  while
marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond
to date  the program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight  including   telecommunications  and computers  apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks  many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world  notably at the  
skylab  196579

skylab space station  1974
skylab was the united states  first and only independently built   conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent
upper stage  the 169,950lb  77,088kg  station was constructed on earth and launched on may 14  1973 atop the first two stages of a   into a 235-nautical-mile  435km  orbit inclined at 50 to the equator  damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel  it was repaired to functionality by its first crew  it was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974  it included a laboratory for studying the effects of   and a   nasa planned to have a space shuttle dock with it  and elevate skylab to a higher safe altitude  but the shuttle was not ready for flight before skylab s re-entry on july 11  1979 
to save cost  nasa used one of the saturn v rockets originally earmarked for a canceled apollo mission to launch the skylab  apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station  three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28  59  and 84 days  skylab s habitable volume was 11,290 cubic feet  320m3   which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the

on may 24  1972  us president
and
premier
signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission  and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other  this authorized the apollo-soyuz test project  astp   involving the rendezvous and docking in earth orbit of a surplus
with a
spacecraft  the mission took place in july 1975  this was the last us manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the
in april 1981 
the mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments  and provided useful engineering experience for future joint usrussian space flights  such as the shuttlemir program and the international space station

launch of the space shuttle
the
became the major focus of nasa in the late 1970s and the 1980s  planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle  four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985  the first to launch    did so on april 12  1981  the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight 
its major components were a
orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side  the external tank  which was bigger than the spacecraft itself  was the only major component that was not reused  the shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185643km  115400   and carry a maximum payload  to low orbit  of 24,400kg  54,000lb   missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts 
on 20 missions  198398  the space shuttle carried   designed in cooperation with the

in 1995  russian-american interaction resumed with the
missions  19951998   once more an american vehicle docked with a russian craft  this time a full-fledged space station  this cooperation has continued with russia and the united states as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built  the
 iss   the strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when nasa began relying on russian launch vehicles to service the iss during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003  
the shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters 
in 1986  and columbia in 2003  while the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the
from replacement parts  nasa did not build another orbiter to replace the   nasa s space shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the space shuttle atlantis at the kennedy space center on july 21  2011  the program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space

more than 1,000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the earth and the solar system  besides exploration  communication satellites have also been launched by nasa  the missions have been launched directly from earth or from orbiting space shuttles  which could either deploy the satellite itself  or with a rocket stage to take it farther 
the first us unmanned satellite was   which started as an abma jpl project during the early part of the   it was launched in january 1958  two months after sputnik  at the creation of nasa the explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day  its missions have been focusing on the earth and the sun  measuring magnetic fields and the   among other aspects  a more recent earth mission  not related to the explorer program  was the   which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990 
the
has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs  the first was
in the 1960s and  70s  which made multiple visits to
and
and one to   probes launched under the mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby     to take the first pictures from another planet     the first planetary orbiter     and the first to make a
maneuver     this is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination 
the first successful landing on mars was made by
in 1976  twenty years later a rover was landed on mars by  
outside mars  jupiter was first visited by
in 1973  more than 20 years later
sent a probe into the planet s atmosphere  and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet

hello  this is charlie bolden  nasa administrator  speaking to you via the broadcast capabilities of the curiosity rover  which is now on the surface of mars 
since the beginning of time  humankinds curiosity has led us to constantly seek new life   new possibilities just beyond the horizon  i want to congratulate the men and women of our nasa family as well as our commercial and government partners around the world  for taking us a step beyond to mars 
this is an extraordinary achievement  landing a rover on mars is not easy others have tried only america has fully succeeded  the investment we are making   the knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of gale crater  will tell us much about the possibility of life on mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet  curiosity will bring benefits to earth and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers  as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future  thank you

budget
nasa s budget from 1958 to 2012 as a percentage of federal budget
an artist s conception  from nasa  of an astronaut planting a us flag on mars  a
has been discussed as a possible nasa mission since the 1960s 
main article 
nasa s budget has generally been approximately 1  of the federal budget from the early 1970s on  after briefly peaking at approximately 4.41  in 1966 during the apollo program  public perception of nasa s budget has differed significantly from reality  a 1997 poll indicated that most americans responded that 20  of the federal budget went to nasa 
the percentage of federal budget that nasa has been allocated has been steadily dropping since the apollo program and in 2012 it was estimated at 0.48  of the federal budget  in a march 2012 meeting of the  
testified that  right now  nasas annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar  for twice thata penny on a dollarwe can transform the country from a sullen  dispirited nation  weary of economic struggle  to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow  
for fiscal year 2015  nasa received an appropriation of us 18.01 billion from congress 549 million more than requested and approximately  350 million more than the 2014 nasa budget passed by congress 
environmental impact
the exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems  both in earth s atmosphere and in space  can adversely effect the earth s environment  some
rocket propellants  such as   are highly toxic prior to   but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning  rockets using hydrocarbon fuels  such as   release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust  however  carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources  on average  the united states consumed 802,620,000 us gallons  3.0382109l  gallons of liquid fuels per day in 2014  while a single
rocket first stage burns around 25,000 us gallons  95,000l  of
fuel per launch  even if a falcon 9 were launched every single day  it would only represent 0.006  of liquid fuel consumption  and carbon dioxide emissions  for that day  additionally  the exhaust from - and - fueled engines  like the   is almost entirely water vapor  nasa addressed environmental concerns with its canceled
in accordance with the national environmental policy act in 2011  in contrast 
use harmless noble gases like
for propulsion 
on may 8  2003 
recognized nasa as the first federal agency to directly use
to produce energy at one of its facilitiesthe   greenbelt  maryland
