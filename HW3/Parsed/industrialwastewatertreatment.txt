industrial wastewater treatment covers the mechanisms and processes used to
that is produced as a by-product of industrial or commercial activities  after treatment  the treated industrial wastewater  or effluent  may be reused or released to a
or to a
in the environment  most industries produce some
although recent trends in the developed world have been to minimise such production or recycle such wastewater within the production process  however  many industries remain dependent on processes that produce

sources of industrial wastewater  
complex organic chemicals industry  
a range of industries manufacture or use complex organic chemicals  these include     paints and           etc  waste waters can be contaminated by feedstock materials  by-products  product material in soluble or particulate form  washing and cleaning agents  solvents and added value products such as   treatment facilities that do not need control of their effluent typically opt for a type of aerobic treatment  i e   
electric power plants  
  particularly -fired plants  are a major source of industrial wastewater  many of these plants discharge wastewater with significant levels of metals such as    
and   as well as  
and
compounds   and    wastewater streams include    
and
mercury control  plants with air pollution controls such as
typically transfer the captured pollutants to the wastewater stream 
  a type of surface impoundment  are a widely used treatment technology at coal-fired plants  these ponds use gravity to
large particulates  measured as   from power plant wastewater  this technology does not treat dissolved pollutants  power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants  depending on the particular wastestream in the plant  these include dry ash handling  closed-loop ash recycling    biological treatment  such as an
process   and evaporation 
food industry  
wastewater generated from agricultural and food operations has distinctive characteristics that set it apart from common municipal wastewater managed by public or private
plants throughout the world  it is
and non-toxic  but has high concentrations of
 bod  and
 ss   the constituents of food and agriculture wastewater are often complex to predict  due to the differences in bod and
in effluents from vegetable  fruit  and meat products and due to the seasonal nature of food processing and post-harvesting 
processing of food from raw materials requires large volumes of high grade water  vegetable washing generates waters with high loads of
and some dissolved   it may also contain surfactants 
animal slaughter and processing produces very strong organic waste from body fluids  such as   and
contents  this wastewater is frequently contaminated by significant levels of
and growth
from the animals and by a variety of pesticides used to control external  
processing food for sale produces wastes generated from cooking which are often rich in plant
and may also contain    
material and
or   very significant quantities of oil or fats may also be present 
iron and steel industry  
the production of
from its ores involves powerful
reactions in blast furnaces  cooling waters are inevitably contaminated with products especially
and   production of
from coal in coking plants also requires
and the use of water in by-products separation  contamination of waste streams includes gasification products such as       cyanide  ammonia   
together with a range of more complex
known collectively as
 pah  
the conversion of iron or steel into sheet  wire or rods requires hot and cold mechanical transformation stages frequently employing water as a lubricant and coolant  contaminants include  
and particulate solids  final treatment of iron and steel products before onward sale into manufacturing includes pickling in strong mineral acid to remove rust and prepare the surface for
or
plating or for other surface treatments such as
or   the two acids commonly used are
and   wastewaters include acidic rinse waters together with waste acid  although many plants operate acid recovery plants  particularly those using hydrochloric acid   where the mineral acid is boiled away from the iron salts  there remains a large volume of highly acid
or
to be disposed of  many steel industry wastewaters are contaminated by hydraulic oil  also known as soluble oil 
mines and quarries  
mine wastewater effluent in peru  with neutralized ph from tailing runoff 
the principal waste-waters associated with
and
are slurries of rock particles in water  these arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces and haul roads and also from rock washing and grading processes  volumes of water can be very high  especially rainfall related arisings on large sites  some specialized separation operations  such as
to separate coal from native rock using   can produce wastewater contaminated by fine particulate
and  
and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants 
wastewater from metal mines and ore recovery plants are inevitably contaminated by the minerals present in the native rock formations  following crushing and extraction of the desirable materials  undesirable materials may enter the wastewater stream  for metal mines  this can include unwanted metals such as
and other materials such as   extraction of high value metals such as
and
may generate
containing very fine particles in where physical removal of contaminants becomes particularly difficult 
additionally  the geologic formations that harbour economically valuable metals such as
and
very often consist of sulphide-type ores  the processing entails grinding the rock into fine particles and then extracting the desired metal s   with the leftover rock being known as tailings  these tailings contain a combination of not only undesirable leftover metals  but also sulphide components which eventually form sulphuric acid upon the exposure to air and water that inevitably occurs when the tailings are disposed of in large impoundments  the resulting   which is often rich in heavy metals  because acids dissolve metals   is one of the many  
nuclear industry  
the waste production from the nuclear and radio-chemicals industry is dealt with as  
pulp and paper industry  
effluent from the
is generally high in
and bod  plants that
for paper making may generate  
 including      phenols and
 cod   stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment  such as
or   increased bod or cod loadings  as well as organic pollutants  may require biological treatment such as
or   for mills with high inorganic loadings like salt  tertiary treatments may be required  either general membrane treatments like
or
or treatments to remove specific contaminants  such as nutrients 
industrial oil contamination  
industrial applications where oil enters the wastewater stream may include vehicle wash bays  workshops  fuel storage depots  transport hubs and power generation  often the wastewater is discharged into local sewer or trade waste systems and must meet local environmental specifications  typical contaminants can include solvents  detergents  grit  lubricants and hydrocarbons 
water treatment  
many industries have a need to treat water to obtain very high quality water for demanding purposes such as environmental discharge compliance  water treatment produces organic and mineral sludges from
and  
using natural or synthetic resins removes  
and
ions from water  typically replacing them with    
and or other ions  regeneration of ion exchange columns with strong acids and alkalis produces a wastewater rich in hardness ions which are readily precipitated out  especially when in admixture with other wastewater constituents 
wool processing  
insecticide residues in fleeces are a particular problem in treating waters generated in
processing  animal fats may be present in the wastewater  which if not contaminated  can be recovered for the production of tallow or further rendering 
treatment of industrial wastewater  
the various types of contamination of wastewater require a variety of strategies to remove the contamination 
brine treatment  
brine treatment involves removing dissolved salt ions from the waste stream  although similarities to seawater or brackish water
exist  industrial brine treatment may contain unique combinations of dissolved ions  such as hardness ions or other metals  necessitating specific processes and equipment 
brine treatment systems are typically optimized to either reduce the volume of the final discharge for more economic disposal  as disposal costs are often based on volume  or maximize the recovery of fresh water or salts  brine treatment systems may also be optimized to reduce electricity consumption  chemical usage  or physical footprint 
brine treatment is commonly encountered when treating cooling tower blowdown 
from   produced water from
extraction such as   frac flowback water    reverse osmosis reject 
wastewater  pulp and paper mill effluent  and waste streams from food and beverage processing 
brine treatment technologies may include  membrane filtration processes  such as   ion exchange processes such as
or   or evaporation processes  such as brine concentrators and
employing
and steam 
may not be viable for brine treatment  due to the potential for fouling caused by hardness salts or organic contaminants  or damage to the reverse osmosis membranes from  
evaporation processes are the most widespread for brine treatment as they enable the highest degree of concentration  as high as solid salt  they also produce the highest purity effluent  even distillate-quality  evaporation processes are also more tolerant of organics  hydrocarbons  or hardness salts  however  energy consumption is high and corrosion may be an issue as the prime mover is concentrated salt water  as a result  evaporation systems typically employ
or
materials 
brine management  
brine management examines the broader context of brine treatment and may include consideration of government policy and regulations    environmental impact  recycling  handling and transport  containment  centralized compared to on-site treatment  avoidance and reduction  technologies  and economics  brine management shares some issues with
and more general  
solids removal  
most solids can be removed using simple sedimentation techniques with the solids recovered as
or sludge  very fine solids and solids with densities close to the density of water pose special problems  in such case filtration or
may be required  although 
may be used  using
salts or the addition of  
oils and grease removal  
the effective removal of oils and grease is dependent on the characteristics of the oil in terms of its suspension state and droplet size  which will in turn affect the choice of separator technology 
oil pollution in water usually comes in four states  often in combination 
free oil - large oil droplets sitting on the surface 
heavy oil  which sits at the bottom  often adhering to solids like dirt 
emulsified  where the oil droplets are heavily  chopped   and
dissolved oil  where the droplets are fully dispersed and not visible  emulsified oil droplets are the most common in industrial oily wastewater and are extremely difficult to separate 
the methodology for separating the oil is dependent on the oil droplet size  larger oil droplets such as those in free oil pollution are easily removed  but as the droplets become smaller  some separator technologies perform better than others 
most separator technologies will have an optimum range of oil droplet sizes that can be effectively treated  this is known as the  micron rating  
analysing the oily water to determine droplet size can be performed with a video particle analyser  alternatively  there are commonalities in industries for oil droplet sizes  larger dropletsgreater than 60 micronsare often present in wastewater in workshops  re-fuel areas and depots  twenty to 50 micron oil droplets often are present in vehicle wash bays  meat processing and dairy manufacturing effluent and aluminium billet cooling towers  smaller droplets in the range of 10 to 20 microns tend to occur in workshops and condensates 
each separator technology will have its own performance curve outlining optimum performance based on oil droplet size  the most common separators are gravity tanks or pits  api oil-water separators or plate packs  chemical treatment via dafs  centrifuges  media filters and hydrocyclones 
api separators
main article 
a typical api oil-water separator used in many industries
many oils can be recovered from open water surfaces by skimming devices  considered a dependable and cheap way to remove oil  grease and other hydrocarbons from water  oil skimmers can sometimes achieve the desired level of water purity  at other times  skimming is also a cost-efficient method to remove most of the oil before using membrane filters and chemical processes  skimmers will prevent filters from blinding prematurely and keep chemical costs down because there is less oil to process 
because grease skimming involves higher viscosity hydrocarbons  skimmers must be equipped with heaters powerful enough to keep grease fluid for discharge  if floating grease forms into solid clumps or mats  a spray bar  aerator or mechanical apparatus can be used to facilitate removal 
however  hydraulic oils and the majority of oils that have degraded to any extent will also have a soluble or emulsified component that will require further treatment to eliminate  dissolving or emulsifying oil using surfactants or
usually exacerbates the problem rather than solving it  producing wastewater that is more difficult to treat 
the wastewaters from large-scale industries such as       and
commonly contain gross amounts of oil and suspended solids  those industries use a device known as an
which is designed to separate the oil and suspended solids from their wastewater   the name is derived from the fact that such separators are designed according to standards published by the
 api  
the api separator is a gravity separation device designed by using
to define the rise velocity of oil droplets based on their
and size  the design is based on the
difference between the oil and the wastewater because that difference is much smaller than the specific gravity difference between the suspended solids and water  the suspended solids settles to the bottom of the separator as a sediment layer  the oil rises to top of the separator and the cleansed wastewater is the middle layer between the oil layer and the solids 
typically  the oil layer is skimmed off and subsequently re-processed or disposed of  and the bottom sediment layer is removed by a chain and flight scraper  or similar device  and a sludge pump  the water layer is sent to further treatment for additional removal of any residual oil and then to some type of biological treatment unit for removal of undesirable dissolved chemical compounds 
a typical parallel plate separator
parallel plate separators are similar to api separators but they include tilted parallel plate assemblies  also known as parallel packs   the parallel plates provide more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules  such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water  however  the parallel plates enhance the degree of oil-water separation  the result is that a parallel plate separator requires significantly less space than a conventional api separator to achieve the same degree of separation 
hydrocyclone oil separators
operate on the process where wastewater enters the cyclone chamber and is spun under extreme centrifugal forces more than 1000 times the force of gravity  this force causes the water and oil droplets to separate  the separated oil is discharged from one end of the cyclone where treated water is discharged through the opposite end for further treatment  filtration or discharge 
hydrocyclones are useful for the greatest range of oil droplet sizes operating from less than 10 microns and up and can operate continuously without water pre-treatment and at any temperature and ph  applications where hydrocyclones are found are in industry where oily water sources arise in workshops  vehicle wash bays  transport hubs  fuel depots and aluminium billet processing  animal fats from meat processing and dairy manufacturing can also be removed without the need of chemical treatment that often is required for dissolved air flotation  daf  systems 
removal of biodegradable organics  
biodegradable organic material of plant or animal origin is usually possible to treat using extended conventional
processes such as
or   problems can arise if the wastewater is excessively diluted with washing water or is highly concentrated such as undiluted blood or milk  the presence of cleaning agents  disinfectants  pesticides  or antibiotics can have detrimental impacts on treatment processes 
activated sludge process  
main article 
a generalized diagram of an activated sludge process 
activated sludge is a
process for treating sewage and industrial wastewater that uses air  or   and
to
organic pollutants  producing a waste sludge  or   containing the oxidized material  in general  an activated sludge process includes 
an aeration tank where air  or oxygen  is injected and thoroughly mixed into the wastewater 
a settling tank  usually referred to as a
or  settler   to allow the waste sludge to settle  part of the waste sludge is recycled to the aeration tank and the remaining waste sludge is removed for further treatment and ultimate disposal 
trickling filter process  
main article 
image 1  a schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a trickling filter
a typical complete trickling filter system
a trickling filter consists of a bed of         or plastic media over which wastewater flows downward and contacts a layer  or film  of
slime covering the bed media 
conditions are maintained by forced air flowing through the bed or by natural convection of air  the process involves
of organic compounds in the wastewater by the microbial slime layer  diffusion of air into the slime layer to provide the oxygen required for the biochemical
of the organic compounds  the end products include
gas  water and other products of the oxidation  as the slime layer thickens  it becomes difficult for the air to penetrate the layer and an inner anaerobic layer is formed 
the fundamental components of a complete trickling filter system are 
a bed of filter medium upon which a layer of microbial slime is promoted and developed 
an enclosure or a container which houses the bed of filter medium 
a system for distributing the flow of wastewater over the filter medium 
a system for removing and disposing of any sludge from the treated effluent 
the treatment of sewage or other wastewater with trickling filters is among the oldest and most well characterized treatment technologies 
a trickling filter is also often called a trickle filter  trickling biofilter    biological filter or biological trickling filter 
treatment of other organics  
synthetic organic materials including solvents  paints  pharmaceuticals  pesticides  products from
production and so forth can be very difficult to treat  treatment methods are often specific to the material being treated  methods include     adsorption      chemical immobilisation or landfill disposal  some materials such as some detergents may be capable of biological degradation and in such cases  a modified form of wastewater treatment can be used 
treatment of acids and alkalis  
acids and alkalis can usually be
under controlled conditions  neutralisation frequently produces a
that will require treatment as a solid residue that may also be toxic  in some cases  gases may be evolved requiring treatment for the gas stream  some other forms of treatment are usually required following neutralisation 
waste streams rich in
ions as from de-ionisation processes can readily lose the hardness ions in a buildup of precipitated calcium and magnesium salts  this precipitation process can cause severe furring of pipes and can  in extreme cases  cause the blockage of disposal pipes  a 1 metre diameter industrial marine discharge pipe serving a major chemicals complex was blocked by such salts in the 1970s  treatment is by concentration of de-ionisation waste waters and disposal to landfill or by careful ph management of the released wastewater 
treatment of toxic materials  
toxic materials including many organic materials  metals  such as zinc  silver      etc   acids  alkalis  non-metallic elements  such as arsenic or   are generally resistant to biological processes unless very dilute  metals can often be precipitated out by changing the ph or by treatment with other chemicals  many  however  are resistant to treatment or mitigation and may require concentration followed by landfilling or recycling  dissolved organics can be incinerated within the wastewater by the advanced oxidation process
