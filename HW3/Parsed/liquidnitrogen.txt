the temperature of liquid nitrogen can readily be reduced to its freezing point 63k  210c  346f  by placing it in a vacuum chamber pumped by a vacuum pump  liquid nitrogen s efficiency as a coolant is limited by the fact that it boils immediately on contact with a warmer object  enveloping the object in insulating nitrogen gas  this effect  known as the   applies to any liquid in contact with an object significantly hotter than its boiling point  faster cooling may be obtained by plunging an object into a slush of liquid and solid nitrogen rather than liquid nitrogen alone

uses
liquid nitrogen is a compact and readily transported source of dry nitrogen gas  as it does not require pressurization  further  its ability to maintain temperatures far below the
of water makes it extremely useful in a wide range of applications  primarily as an open-cycle   including 
in
for removing unsightly or potentially
skin lesions such as
and
to store cells at low temperature for laboratory work

gas
for the immersion  freezing  and transportation of
products
for the

samples and materials
to preserve tissue samples from surgical excisions for future studies
to facilitate
as a method of freezing water and oil pipes in order to work on them in situations where a valve is not available to block fluid flow to the work area  method known as a cryogenic isolation  frequently used in industry and new york district steam pipework   electrical heat pumps are now often used for small pipe diameters

culinary use of liquid nitrogen
see also 
the culinary use of liquid nitrogen is mentioned in an 1890 recipe book titled fancy ices authored by mrs    but has been employed in more recent times by restaurants in the preparation of frozen desserts  such as ice cream  which can be created within moments at the table because of the speed at which it cools food  the rapidity of chilling also leads to the formation of smaller ice crystals  which provides the dessert with a smoother texture  the technique is employed by chef
who has used it at his restaurant 
to create frozen dishes such as egg and bacon ice cream  liquid nitrogen has also become popular in the preparation of
because it can be used to quickly chill glasses or freeze ingredients  it is also added to drinks to create a smoky effect  which occurs as tiny droplets of the liquid nitrogen come into contact with the surrounding air  condensing the vapour that is naturally present 
safety
filling a liquid nitrogen
from a storage tank
because the liquid-to-gas
of nitrogen is 1 694 at 20c  68f   a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporized in an enclosed space  in an incident on january 12  2006 at   the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed  as a result of the subsequent pressure buildup  the tank failed catastrophically  the force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it  shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it  and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.10.2 m off their foundations 
because of its extremely low temperature  careless handling of liquid nitrogen and any objects cooled by it may result in   in that case  special gloves should be used while handling  however  a small splash or even pouring down skin will not burn immediately  because the evaporating gas thermally insulates to some extent  like touching a hot element very briefly with a wet finger  if the liquid nitrogen pools anywhere  it will burn severely 
as liquid nitrogen evaporates it reduces the
concentration in the
and can act as an   especially in   nitrogen is odorless  colorless  and tasteless and may produce
without any sensation or prior warning 
are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space 
vessels containing liquid nitrogen can
from air  the liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen  boiling point 90k  183c  298f  as the nitrogen evaporates  and can cause violent oxidation of organic material 
ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage  for example  in 2012  a young woman in england had her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen 
production
main article 
liquid nitrogen is produced commercially from the
of
or from the liquefication of pure nitrogen derived from air using   an
is used to compress filtered air to high pressure  the high-pressure gas is cooled back to ambient temperature  and allowed to expand to a low pressure  the expanding air cools greatly  the    and oxygen  nitrogen  and argon are separated by further stages of expansion and distillation  small-scale production of liquid nitrogen is easily achieved using this principle  liquid nitrogen may be produced for direct sale  or as a byproduct of manufacture of liquid oxygen used for industrial processes such as   liquid-air plants producing on the order of tons per day of product started to be built in the 1930s but became very common after the second world war  a large modern plant may produce 3000 tons day of liquid air products
