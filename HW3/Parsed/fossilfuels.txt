  one of the fossil fuels
fossil fuels are
formed by natural processes such as
of buried dead   containing energy originating in ancient   the age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years  and sometimes exceeds 650 million years  fossil fuels contain high percentages of
and include     and   other commonly used derivatives include
and   fossil fuels range from
materials with low   ratios like   to liquids like petroleum  to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon  like
coal  methane can be found in
fields either alone  associated with   or in the form of  
the theory that fossil fuels formed from the
of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth s crust over millions of years was first introduced by
in 1556 and later by
in the 18th century 
the
estimates that in 2007 the primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0   coal 27.4   natural gas 23.0   amounting to an 86.4  share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world  non-fossil sources in 2006 included
8.5  
6.3   and others              amounting to 0.9   world energy consumption was growing about 2.3  per year 
although fossil fuels are continually being formed via natural processes  they are generally considered to be
because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made   
the use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns  the burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3billion
 21.3   of
 co2  per year  but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount  so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year  one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7tonnes of carbon dioxide   carbon dioxide is one of the

petroleum and natural gas are formed by the
of remains of organisms including

caused the organic matter to chemically   first into a waxy material known as
which is found in   and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as   despite these heat driven transformations  which may increase the energy density compared to typical organic matter   the embedded energy is still photosynthetic in origin 
there is a wide range of organic  or hydrocarbon  compounds in any given fuel mixture  the specific mixture of hydrocarbons gives a fuel its characteristic properties  such as boiling point  melting point  density  viscosity  etc  some fuels like natural gas  for instance  contain only very low boiling  gaseous components  others such as gasoline or diesel contain much higher boiling components

fossil fuels are of great importance because they can be burned   to

as a fuel predates recorded history  coal was used to run furnaces for the melting of   semi-solid hydrocarbons from seeps were also burned in ancient times  but these materials were mostly used for waterproofing and  
commercial exploitation of   largely as a replacement for oils from animal sources  notably    for use in

  which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil  and   where
is found mixed with sand and clay  are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel 
and similar materials are
rocks containing   a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds  which yield

limits and alternatives
main articles        and
p  e  hodgson  a senior research fellow emeritus in physics at corpus christi college  oxford  expects the world energy use is doubling every fourteen years and the need is increasing faster still and he insisted in 2008 that the world oil production  a main resource of fossil fuel  is expected to peak in ten years and thereafter fall 
the principle of
holds that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish  prices will rise  therefore  higher prices will lead to increased alternative 
supplies as previously uneconomic sources become sufficiently economical to exploit  artificial gasolines and other
sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional   but may become economically viable in the near future  different
include         and  
one of the more promising energy alternatives is the use of inedible feed stocks and biomass for carbon dioxide capture as well as biofuel  while these processes are not without problems  they are currently in practice around the world  biodiesels are being produced by several companies and source of great research at several universities  some of the most common and promising processes of conversion of renewable lipids in to usable fuels is through

environmental effects

main article 
the united states holds less than 5  of the world s population  but due to large houses and private cars  uses more than a quarter of the world s supply of fossil fuels  in the united states  more than 90  of
come from the combustion of fossil fuels    combustion of fossil fuels also produces other air pollutants  such as    
and  
according to environment canada 
 the
is unique among industrial sectors in its very large contribution to emissions associated with nearly all air issues  electricity generation produces a large share of canadian nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions  which contribute to smog and
and the formation of fine particulate matter  it is the largest uncontrolled industrial source of mercury emissions in canada  fossil fuel-fired electric power plants also emit   which may contribute to climate change  in addition  the sector has significant impacts on water and habitat and species  in particular 
and
have significant effects on water and   
carbon dioxide variations over the last 400,000 years  showing a rise since the industrial revolution
according to u s  scientist jerry mahlman and usa today  mahlman  who crafted the ipcc language used to define levels of scientific certainty  says the new report will lay the blame at the feet of fossil fuels with  virtual certainty   meaning 99  sure  that s a significant jump from  likely   or 66  sure  in the group s last report in 2001  mahlman says  his role in this year s effort involved spending two months reviewing the more than 1,600 pages of research that went into the new assessment 
combustion of fossil fuels generates     and   which fall to earth as acid rain  impacting both natural areas and the built environment  monuments and sculptures made from
and
are particularly vulnerable  as the acids dissolve  
fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials  mainly
and   which are released into the atmosphere  in 2000  about 12,000
of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal  it is estimated that during 1982  us coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the  
burning coal also generates large amounts of
and   these materials are used in a wide variety of   utilizing  for example  about 40  of the us production 
harvesting  processing  and distributing fossil fuels can also create environmental concerns 
methods  particularly mountaintop removal and strip mining  have negative environmental impacts  and
poses a hazard to aquatic organisms 
also have negative environmental impacts  including air and water pollution  transportation of coal requires the use of diesel-powered locomotives  while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships  each of which requires the combustion of additional fossil fuels 
uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions  such as command-and-control  which mandates the amount of pollution or the technology used   economic incentives  or voluntary programs 
an example of such regulation in the usa is the  epa is implementing policies to reduce airborne mercury emissions  under regulations issued in 2005  coal-fired power plants will need to reduce their emissions by 70 percent by 2018   
in economic terms  pollution from fossil fuels is regarded as a negative   taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit  in order to  internalize  the cost of pollution  this aims to make fossil fuels more expensive  thereby reducing their use and the amount of pollution associated with them  along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors   
according to rodman d  griffin   the burning of coal and oil have saved inestimable amounts of time and labor while substantially raising living standards around the world   although the use of fossil fuels may seem beneficial to our lives  this act is playing a role on global warming and it is said to be dangerous for the future 
moreover  these environmental pollutions impacts on the human beings because its particles of the fossil fuel on the air cause negative health effects when inhaled by people  these health effects include premature death  acute respiratory illness  aggravated asthma  chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function  so  the poor  undernourished  very young and very old  and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill health  are more at risk

economic effects
europe spent 406 billion on importing fossil fuels in 2011 and 545 billion in 2012  this is around three times more than the cost of the
up to 2013  in 2012
avoided 9.6 billion of fossil fuel costs  a 2014 report by the
said that the fossil fuels industry collects  550 billion a year in global government subsidies  this amount was  490 billion in 2014  but would have been  610 billion without agreements made in 2009 
a 2015 report studied 20 fossil fuel companies and found that  while highly profitable  the hidden economic cost to society was also large  the report spans the period 20082012 and notes that   for all companies and all years  the economic cost to society of their co2 emissions was greater than their aftertax profit  with the single exception of
in 2008   4 pure coal companies fare even worse   the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue in all years  with this cost varying between nearly  2 and nearly  9 per  1 of revenue   5 in this case  total revenue includes  employment  taxes  supply purchases  and indirect employment   4
