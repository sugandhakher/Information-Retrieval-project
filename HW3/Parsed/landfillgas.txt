landfill gas is a complex mix of different gases created by the action of
within a   landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent   with the remainder being mostly   trace amounts of other volatile organic compounds comprise the remainder   1    these trace gases include a large array of species  mainly simple

production of landfill gases  
landfill gases are the result of three processes 
evaporation of volatile organic compounds  e g   solvents 
between waste components
  especially  
the first two depend strongly on the nature of the waste  the dominant process in most landfills is the third process whereby
decompose organic waste to produce biogas  which consists of methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds  despite the heterogeneity of waste  the evolution of gases follows well defined   formation of methane and co2 commences about six months after depositing the landfill material  the evolution of gas reaches a maximum at about 20 years  then declines over the course of decades 
variation with landfill content  
the nature of the material in a landfill affects the landfill gas at the trace levels  for example  gases from municipal landfills contain traces of   since such
are used in personal care products 
monitoring  
main article 
because gases produced by landfills are both valuable and sometimes hazardous  monitoring techniques have been developed  flame ionization detectors can be used to measure methane levels as well as total voc levels  surface monitoring and sub-surface monitoring as well as monitoring of the ambient air is carried out  in the u s   under the clean air act of 1996  it is required that many large landfills install gas collection and control systems  which means that at the very least the facilities must collect and flare the gas 
u s  federal regulations under subtitle d of rcra formed in october 1979 regulate the siting  design  construction  operation  monitoring  and closure of msw landfills  subtitle d now requires controls on the migration of methane in landfill gas  monitoring requirements must be met at landfills during their operation  and for an additional 30 years after  the landfills affected by subtitle d of rcra are required to control gas by establishing a way to check for methane emissions periodically and therefore prevent off-site migration  landfill owners and operators must make sure the concentration of methane gas does not exceed 25  of the lel for methane in the facilities  structures and the lel for methane at the facility boundary 
landfill gas use  
main article 
landfill gas collection system
u s 
data shows that more than 950 municipal solid waste landfills are operating in the united states as of 2013  decomposing waste in these landfills produce landfill gas  which is a mixture of about half methane and half carbon dioxide  these landfills are the third largest source of human-made methane emissions in the united states 
the gases produced within a landfill can be collected and used in various ways  the landfill gas can be utilized directly on site by a boiler or any type of combustion system  providing heat  electricity can also be generated on site through the use of microturbines  steam turbines  or fuel cells  the landfill gas can also be sold off site and sent into natural gas pipelines  this approach requires the gas to be processed into pipeline quality  e g   by removing various contaminants and components  the efficiency of gas collection at landfills directly impacts the amount of energy that can be recovered - closed landfills  those no longer accepting waste  collect gas more efficiently than open landfills  those that are still accepting waste   a comparison of collection efficiency at closed and open landfills found about a 17 percentage point difference between the two 
landfill gas can also be used to evaporate leachate  another byproduct of the landfill process  this application displaces another fuel that was previously used for the same thing 
evaporation system
in the u s   the number of landfill gas projects increased from 399 in 2005  to 594 in 2012 according to the   these projects are popular because they control energy costs and reduce
emissions  these projects collect the methane gas and treat it  so it can be used for electricity or upgraded to pipeline-grade gas   methane gas has twenty-one times the
of carbon dioxide  
the u s    which estimates that hundreds of landfills could support gas to energy projects  has also established the landfill methane outreach program  this program was developed to reduce methane emissions from landfills in a cost-effective manner by encouraging the development of environmentally and economically beneficial landfill gas-to-energy projects 
in the u s  
uses landfill gas as an energy source  their landfill gas-to-energy projects create sufficient energy to power four hundred thousand homes every day  this energy production offsets almost two million tons of coal per year  these projects also reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere  waste management currently has 110 landfill gas-to-energy facilities  this gas is equivalent to natural gas 
opposition  
capture and use of landfill gas can be expensive  some environmental groups claim that the projects do not produce  renewable power  because trash  their source  is not renewable  the
opposes government subsidies for such projects  the
 nrdc  argues that government incentives should be directed more towards solar  wind  and energy-efficiency efforts 
environmental effects  
landfill gases have an influence on   the major components are
and   both of which are   in terms of global warming potential  methane is over 25 times more detrimental to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide  landfills are the third largest source of methane in the us 
microbial oxidation  
when landfill gas permeates through a soil cover  a fraction of the
in the gas is oxidized microbially to  
safety  
landfill gas emissions can lead to  
and
problems in the landfill  several accidents have occurred  for example at   england in 1986  where migrating landfill gas accumulated and partially destroyed a property  an accident causing two deaths occurred from an explosion in a house adjacent to skellingsted landfill in denmark in 1991  due to the risk presented by landfill gas  there is a clear need to monitor gas produced by landfills  in addition to the risk of fire and explosion  gas migration in the subsurface can result in contact of landfill gas with   this  in turn  can result in contamination of groundwater by organic compounds present in nearly all landfill gas 
although usually evolved only in trace amounts  landfills do release some
and  
  due to pressure differentials and diffusion  can occur  this can create an explosion hazard if the gas reaches sufficiently high concentrations in adjacent buildings
