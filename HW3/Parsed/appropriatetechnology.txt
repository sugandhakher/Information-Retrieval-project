appropriate technology is an
movement  and its manifestations  encompassing
choice and application that is small-scale          and   it was originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist
in his work   both schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered 
appropriate technology has been used to address issues in a wide range of fields  well-known examples of appropriate technology applications include  bike- and hand-powered water pumps  and other    the   self-contained

background  
history  
history of technology  the development over time of systematic techniques for making and doing things  the term technology  a combination of the greek techn   art  craft   with logos   word  speech   meant in greece a discourse on the arts  both fine and   when it first appeared in english in the 17th century  it was used to mean a discussion of the applied arts only  and gradually these  arts  themselves came to be the object of the designation  by the early 20th century  the term embraced a growing range of means  processes  and ideas in addition to tools and machines  by mid-century  technology was defined by such phrases as  the means or activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment   even such broad definitions have been criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific inquiry and technological activity 
a highly compressed account of the history of technology such as this one must adopt a rigorous methodological pattern if it is to do justice to the subject without grossly distorting it one way or another  the plan followed in the present article is primarily chronological  tracing the development of technology through phases that succeed each other in time  obviously  the division between phases is to a large extent arbitrary  one factor in the weighting has been the enormous acceleration of western technological development in recent centuries  eastern technology is considered in this article in the main only as it relates to the development of modern technology 
predecessors  
indian ideological leader
is often cited as the  father  of the appropriate technology movement  though the concept had not been given a name  gandhi advocated for small  local and predominantly village-based technology to help india s villages become self-reliant  he disagreed with the idea of technology that benefited a minority of people at the expense of the majority or that put people out of work to increase profit  in 1925 gandhi founded the all-india spinners association and in 1935 he retired from politics to form the all-india village industries association  both organizations focused on village-based technology similar to the future appropriate technology movement 
china also implemented policies similar to appropriate technology during the reign of
and the following   during the cultural revolution  development policies based on the idea of  walking on two legs  advocated the development of both large-scale factories and small-scale village industries 
e  f  schumacher  
despite these early examples 
is credited as the founder of the appropriate technology movement  a well-known economist  schumacher worked for the british national coal board for more than 20 years  where he blamed the size of the industry s operations for its uncaring response to the harm
inflicted on the miners  however it was his work with developing countries  such as
and   which helped schumacher form the underlying principles of appropriate technology 
schumacher first articulated the idea of  intermediate technology   now known as appropriate technology  in a 1962 report to the indian planning commission in which he described india as long in labor and short in capital  calling for an  intermediate industrial technology  that harnessed india s labor surplus  schumacher had been developing the idea of intermediate technology for several years prior to the planning commission report  in 1955  following a stint as an economic advisor to the government of burma  he published the short paper  economics in a buddhist country   his first known critique of the effects of western economics on developing countries  in addition to buddhism  schumacher also credited his ideas to gandhi 
initially  schumacher s ideas were rejected by both the indian government and leading development economists  spurred to action over concern the idea of intermediate technology would languish  schumacher  george mcrobie 
and julia porter brought together a group of approximately 20 people to form the
 itdg  in may 1965  later that year  a schumacher article published in the
garnered significant attention and support for the group  in 1967  the group published the tools for progress  a guide to small-scale equipment for rural development and sold 7,000 copies  itdg also formed panels of experts and practitioners around specific technological needs  such as building construction  energy and water  to develop intermediate technologies to address those needs  at a conference hosted by the itdg in 1968 the term  intermediate technology  was discarded in favor of the term  appropriate technology  used today  intermediate technology had been criticized as suggesting the technology was inferior to advanced  or high  technology and not including the social and political factors included in the concept put forth by the proponents  in 1973  schumacher described the concept of appropriate technology to a mass audience in his influential work  small is beautiful  economics as if people mattered 
growing trend  
the
in use in uganda  an example of appropriate technology
between 1966 and 1975 the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times greater than the previous nine years  there was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations  particularly issues related to energy and the environment  in 1977  the oecd identified in its appropriate technology directory 680 organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology  by 1980  this number had grown to more than 1,000  international agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology  indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment  for example  the
created a committee for the application of intermediate technology in 1976 and the
established the appropriate technology for health program in 1977 
appropriate technology was also increasingly applied in developed countries  for example  the energy crisis of the mid-1970s led to the creation of the
 ncat  in 1977 with an initial appropriation of 3 million dollars from the u s  congress  the center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to  help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life  and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand   however  by 1981 the ncat s funding agency  community services administration  had been abolished  for several decades ncat worked with the us departments of energy and agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs  since 2005  ncat s informational web site is no longer funded by the us government 
decline  
in more recent years  the appropriate technology movement has continued to decline in prominence  germany s german appropriate technology exchange  gate  and holland s technology transfer for development  tool  are examples of organizations no longer in operation  recently  a study looked at the continued barriers to at deployment despite the relatively low cost of transferring information in the internet age  the barriers have been identified as  at seen as inferior or  poor person s  technology  technical transferability and robustness of at  insufficient funding  weak institutional support  and the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty 
a more -centric view has also begun to dominate the field  for example    founder of
 an organization that designs and manufactures products that follow the ideals of appropriate technology   declared appropriate technology dead in a 2010 blog post 
polak argues the    movement has replaced appropriate technology  growing out of the appropriate technology movement  designing for the other 90 percent advocates the creation of low-cost solutions for the 5.8 billion of the world s 6.8 billion population  who have little or no access to most of the products and services many of us take for granted  
many of the ideas integral to appropriate technology can now be found in the increasingly popular    movement  which among many tenets advocates technological choice that meets human needs while preserving the environment for future   in 1983  the oecd published the results of an extensive survey of appropriate technology organizations titled  the world of appropriate technology  in which it defined appropriate technology as characterized by  low investment cost per work-place  low capital investment per unit of output  organizational simplicity  high adaptability to a particular social or cultural environment  sparing use of natural resources  low cost of final product or high potential for employment   today  the oecd web site redirects from the  glossary of statistical terms  entry on  appropriate technology  to  environmentally sound technologies   the united nations   index to economic and social development  also redirects from the  appropriate technology  entry to  sustainable development  
potential resurgence  
despite the decline  several appropriate technology organizations are still in existence  including the itdg which became
after a name change in 2005 
 schwierzerische kontaktstelle fr angepasste technology  adapted by becoming a private consultancy in 1998  though some intermediate technology activities are continued by
through the   another actor still very active is the charity   pioneer in food transformation and solar heaters  it offers vocational training in west africa and madagascar  there is also currently a notable resurgence as viewed by the number of groups adopting
 osat  because of the enabling technology of the internet  these osat groups include            center for development alternatives        and   most recently   engineers without borders usa  and the
have joined together to produce   which facilitates the development of affordable  locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to the most pressing humanitarian challenges 
terminology  
appropriate technology frequently serves as an umbrella term for a variety names for this type of technology  frequently these terms are used interchangeably  however  the use of one term over another can indicate the specific focus  bias or agenda of the technological choice in question  though the original name for the concept now known as appropriate technology   intermediate technology  is now often considered a subset of appropriate technology that focuses on technology that is more productive than  inefficient  traditional technologies  but less costly than the technology of industrialized societies  other types of technology under the appropriate technology umbrella include 
capital-saving technology
labor-intensive technology
alternate technology
self-help technology
village-level technology
community technology
progressive technology
indigenous technology
peoples technology
light-engineering technology
adaptive technology
light-capital technology
soft technology
a variety of competing definitions exist in academic literature and organization and government policy papers for each of these terms  however  the general consensus is appropriate technology encompasses the ideas represented by the above list  furthermore  the use of one term over another in referring to an appropriate technology can indicate ideological bias or emphasis on particular economic or social variables  some terms inherently emphasize the importance of increased employment and labor utilization  such as labor-intensive or capital-saving technology   while others may emphasize the importance of human development  such as self-help and people s technology  
it is also possible to distinguish between hard and soft technologies  according to dr 
and audrey faulkner  appropriate hard technology is  engineering techniques  physical structures  and machinery that meet a need defined by a community  and utilize the material at hand or readily available  it can be built  operated and maintained by the local people with very limited outside assistance  e g   technical  material  or financial   it is usually related to an economic goal  
albertson and faulkner consider appropriate soft technology as technology that deals with  the social structures  human interactive processes  and motivation techniques  it is the structure and process for social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations  making choices and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change

development  
schumacher s initial concept of intermediate technology was created as a critique of the currently prevailing development strategies which focused on maximizing aggregate economic growth through increases to overall measurements of a country s economy  such as
 gdp   developed countries became aware of the situation of developing countries during and in the years following   based on the continuing rise in income levels in western countries since the industrial revolution  developed countries embarked on a campaign of massive transfers of capital and technology to developing countries in order to force a rapid industrialization intended to result in an economic  take-off  in the developing countries 
however  by the late 1960s it was becoming clear this development method had not worked as expected and a growing number of development experts and national policy makers were recognizing it as a potential cause of increasing poverty and income inequality in developing countries  in many countries  this influx of technology had increased the overall economic capacity of the country  however  it had created a dual or two-tiered economy with pronounced division between the classes  the foreign technology imports were only benefiting a small minority of urban elites  this was also increasing urbanization with the rural poor moving to urban cities in hope of more financial opportunities  the increased strain on urban infrastructures and public services led to  increasing squalor  severe impacts on public health and distortions in the social structure  
appropriate technology was meant to address four problems  extreme poverty  starvation  unemployment and urban migration  schumacher saw the main purpose for economic development programs was the eradication of extreme poverty and he saw a clear connection between mass unemployment and extreme poverty  schumacher sought to shift development efforts from a bias towards urban areas and on increasing the output per laborer to focusing on rural areas  where a majority of the population still lived  and on increasing employment 
in developed countries  
the term appropriate technology is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society  i e   technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate 
asserts that such technology  described in the book
tends to promote values such as  
and permanence  in that order

as of 2006  waterborne diseases are estimated to cause 1.8 million deaths each year while about 1.1 billion people lack proper drinking water 
water generally needs treatment before use  depending on the source and the intended use  with high standards required for drinking water   the quality of water from household connections and community water points in low-income countries is not reliably safe for direct human consumption  water extracted directly from surface waters and open hand-dug shallow wells nearly always requires treatment 
appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use  pou  designs 
the most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil  other techniques  such as varying forms of filtration  chemical disinfection  and exposure to ultraviolet radiation  including solar uv  have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries 
over the past decade  an increasing number of field-based studies have been undertaken to determine the success of pou measures in reducing waterborne disease  the ability of pou options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness  technologies may generate more  or less  health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest 
the current priority of the proponents of pou treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis  few pou measures have reached significant scale thus far  but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the world s poor have only been under way for a few years 
on the other hand  small-scale water treatment is reaching increasing fractions of the population in low-income countries  particularly in south and southeast asia  in the form of water treatment kiosks  also known as water refill stations or packaged water producers   while quality control and quality assurance in such locations may be variable  sophisticated technology  such as multi-stage particle filtration  uv irradiation  ozonation  and membrane filtration  is applied with increasing frequency  such microenterprises are able to vend water at extremely low prices  with increasing government regulation  initial assessments of vended water quality are encouraging

before being able to determine the cause of the disease or malady  accurate diagnosis is required  this may be done manually  through observation  inquiries  and by specialized tools

  a website developed by   strips all the photographic and other bandwidth-intensive content from webpages and renders them as simple text  while otherwise allowing one to

an increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive
and
services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless   network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors  each operating a router as a household appliance  these minimize wired infrastructure  and its costs and vulnerabilities  private
networks set up in this way can operate without the use of a commercial provider 
rural electrical grids can be wired with  optical phase cable   in which one or more of the
wires are replaced with steel tubes containing

and forms of

traffic  negating the need for separate telephony services  finally  the
provides potential for blending older  cheap  local radio broadcasting with the increased range of the internet 
-based telephone systems can also be used  as either fixed installations or portable handsets and can be integrated into a
or local ip-based network 
finance  
through financial systems envisioned especially for the poor developed world  many companies have been able to get started with only limited capital  often banks lend the money to people wishing to start a business  such as with    in other systems  people for a

and    finally  in certain communities  usually isolated communities such as small islands or oases  everything of value is shared  this is called  
determining a sustainable approach  
features such as low cost  low usage of
and use of locally available resources can give some advantages in terms of   for that reason  these technologies are sometimes used and promoted by advocates of sustainability and  
besides using natural  locally available resources  e g  wood or adobe   waste materials imported from cities using conventional  and inefficient  waste management may be gathered and re-used to build a sustainable living environment  use of these cities  waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost  when obtained  the materials may be recycled over and over in the own city community  using the
method  locations where waste can be found include     on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways  organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages  also  town districts and other places  e g    that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for gathering materials as stone  concrete  or potassium
