the sustainable yield of
is the
that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself  i e  the
required to maintain
at the same or increasing level over time  this yield usually varies over time with the needs of the
to maintain itself  e g  a
that has recently suffered a
or
or
will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest  while doing so  the sustainable yield may be much less 
in forestry terms it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock 
this concept is important in fishery management  in which sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock  and the
is defined as the amount of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions  in fisheries  the basic natural capital or virgin population  must decrease with extraction  at the same time productivity increases  hence  sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield  it may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield  because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors not related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both  the natural capital and its productivity 
in the case of
there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time  beyond which the
risks the state of
or even depletion 
provinces that do or do not follow the sustained yield management  
british columbia does not follow the sustained yield management
