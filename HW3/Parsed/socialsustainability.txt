social sustainability is the least defined and least understood of the different ways of approaching
and   social sustainability has had considerably less attention in public dialogue than economic and environmental sustainability 
there are several approaches to social sustainability  the first  which posits a triad of environmental sustainability    and social sustainability  is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability  the concept of  social sustainability  in this approach encompasses such topics as                          community resilience  and human adaptation 
a second  more recent  approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social  including ecological  economic  political and cultural sustainability  these domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural  with the  ecological domain  defined as human embeddedness in the environment  in these terms  social sustainability encompasses all human activities  it is not just relevant to the focussed intersection of economics  the environment and the social   see the venn diagram and the
