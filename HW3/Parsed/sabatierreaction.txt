the sabatier reaction or sabatier process was discovered by the
in the 1910s  it involves the reaction of
with

 some initial energy heat is required to start the reaction

it has been proposed in a renewable-energy-dominated energy system to use the excess electricity generated by wind  solar photovoltaic  hydro  marine current  etc  to make methane  natural gas  via water electrolysis and the subsequent application of the sabatier reaction  in contrast to a direct usage of hydrogen for transport or energy storage applications  the methane can be injected into the existing gas network  which in many countries has one or two years of gas storage capacity  the methane can then be used on demand to generate electricity  and heatcombined heat and power  overcoming low points of renewable energy production  the process is electrolysis of water by electricity to create hydrogen  which can partly be used directly in fuel cells  and the addition of carbon dioxide co2  sabatier process  to create methane  the co2 can be extracted from the air or fossil fuel waste gases by the   amongst many others  it is a low-co2 system  and has similar efficiencies of today s energy system  a 6 mw power-to-gas plant went into production in germany in 2013  and power a fleet of 1500 audi a3s 
international space station life support  
oxygen generators on board the
produce oxygen from water using   the hydrogen produced was previously discarded into space  as astronauts consume oxygen  carbon dioxide is produced  which must then be removed from the air and discarded as well  this approach required copious amounts of water to be regularly transported to the space station for oxygen generation in addition to that used for human consumption  hygiene  and other usesa luxury that will not be available to future long-duration missions beyond  
is using the sabatier reaction to recover water from exhaled carbon dioxide and the hydrogen previously discarded from electrolysis on the international space station and possibly for future missions  the other resulting chemical  methane  is released into space  as half of the input hydrogen becomes wasted as methane  additional hydrogen is supplied from earth to make up the difference  however  this creates a nearly-closed cycle between water  oxygen  and carbon dioxide which only requires a relatively modest amount of imported hydrogen to maintain 
ignoring other results of respiration  this cycle looks like

the released hydrogen would then be recycled back into the sabatier reactor  leaving an easily removed deposit of   the reactor would be little more than a steel pipe  and could be periodically serviced by an astronaut where the deposit is chiselled out   
alternatively  the loop could be partially closed  75  of h2 from ch4 recovered  by incomplete pyrolysis of the waste methane while keeping the carbon locked up in gaseous form

the bosch reaction would present a completely closed hydrogen and oxygen cycle which only produces atomic carbon as waste  however  difficulties maintaining its temperature of up to 600c and properly handling carbon deposits mean significantly more research will be required before a bosch reactor could become a reality  one problem is that the production of elemental carbon tends to foul the catalyst s surface  which is detrimental to the reaction s efficiency 
manufacturing propellant on mars  
the sabatier reaction has been proposed as a key step in reducing the cost of
exploration of mars      through   hydrogen is combined with co2 from the atmosphere  with methane then stored as fuel and the water side product
yielding oxygen to be liquefied and stored as oxidizer and hydrogen to be recycled back into the reactor  the original hydrogen could be transported from earth or separated from martian sources of water 
a variation of the basic sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars  utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere  a 2011 prototype test operation that harvested co2 from a simulated martian atmosphere and reacted it with h2  produced methane rocket propellant at a rate of 1kg day  operating autonomously for 5 consecutive days  maintaining a nearly 100  conversion rate  an optimized system of this design massing 50kg  is projected to produce 1 kg day of o2 ch4 propellant     with a methane purity of 98   while consuming 700 watts of electrical power   overall unit conversion rate expected from the optimized system is one
of propellant per 17 mwh energy input 
detailed chemical reactions  
the
ratio of oxidizer and fuel is 2 1  for an oxygen methane engine 
ch4   2 o2  co2   2 h2o
however  one pass through the sabatier reactor produces a ratio of only 1 1  more oxygen may be produced by running the
in reverse  effectively extracting oxygen from the atmosphere by reducing carbon dioxide to  
another option is to make more methane than needed and pyrolyze the excess of it into carbon and hydrogen  see above section  where the hydrogen is recycled back into the reactor to produce further methane and water  in an automated system  the carbon deposit may be removed by blasting with hot martian co2  oxidizing the carbon into carbon monoxide  which is vented   
a fourth solution to the
problem would be to combine the sabatier reaction with the reverse water gas-shift reaction in a single reactor as follows   
3 co2   6 h2  ch4   2 co   4 h2o
this reaction is slightly exothermic  and when the water is electrolyzed  an oxygen to methane ratio of 2 1 is obtained 
regardless of which method of oxygen fixation is utilized  the overall process can be summarized by the following equation   
2 h2   3 co2  ch4   2 o2   2 co
looking at molecular masses  we have produced sixteen grams of methane and 64 grams of oxygen using four grams of hydrogen  which would have to be imported from earth unless martian water was electrolysed   for a mass gain of 20 1  and the methane and oxygen are in the right stochiometric ratio to be burned in a rocket engine  this kind of
would result in massive weight and cost savings to any proposed manned mars or sample return missions
