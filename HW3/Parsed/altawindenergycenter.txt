alta wind energy center  awec   also known as mojave wind farm  is the third largest onshore wind energy project in the world  the alta wind energy center is a
located in
of the   in   as of 2013  it is the largest wind farm in the united states  with a combined installed capacity of 1,547mw  2,075,000hp   the project  being developed near  site of the first large-scale wind farms installed in the u s  in the 1970s and 1980sis  a powerful illustration of the growing size and scope of modern wind projects  
has agreed to a 25-year
for the power produced as part of the power purchase agreements for up to 1,500mw  2,000,000hp  or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the tehachapi area  the project will  reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 5.2 million metric tons  which is equivalent to taking 446,000 cars off the road   a total of 3,000mw  4,000,000hp  is planned 
the wind farm is being developed by
which closed a us 1.2billion financing deal in july 2010 with partners that included     and   after many delays  the first phase began construction in 2010  financing for additional phases of  650 million was secured in april 2012  construction of the alta wind energy center is expected to create more than 3,000domestic manufacturing  construction  and maintenance jobs  and contribute more than one billion dollars to the local economy

history  
a small portion of alta wind energy center looking from oak creek road 
the original  alta-oak creek mojave project  plan consisted of up to 320 occupying a 9,000-acre  36km2  area while producing 800mw  1,100,000hp  of power  that project was originally developed by oak creek energy systems under the contract with terra-gen  but the project development was later transferred to terra-gen  the project then became the first development under the umbrella of alta wind energy center 
the alta-oak creek mojave project is generally located at the south side of the oak creek road  starting a few miles west of the state route 14 in
and continuing westward along the oak creek road to the west side of the tehachapi-willow springs road 
according to the   two initial projects were completed in fall 2010  the 150mw  200,000hp  alta ii  vestas  project using 50 3mw  4,000hp  generators and the 150mw alta i project using 100 1.5mw generators  three subsequent projects 150mw alta iii  102mw  137,000hp  alta iv  and 168mw alta v projects were completed in the 2nd quarter of 2011 using 50  34  and 56 3mw vestas v-90 wind turbines  alta viii and alta vi projects  comprising 300mw  400,000hp   were completed in late 2011 early 2012  alta vii and ix projects comprising 300mw  400,000hp   were completed in december 2012  bringing the total to 1,320mw  1,770,000hp    but they were renamed to pinyon pines wind i and pinyon pines wind ii 
138mw  185,000hp  alta x and 90mw  120,000hp  alta xi are under development with scheduled completion in late 2013  180mw  240,000hp  alta xiii in 2019
