biomass is
derived from living  or recently living organisms  biomass can be used as a source of energy and it most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed  and are specifically called   as an energy source  biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat  or indirectly after converting it to various forms of   conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into  thermal  chemical  and biochemical methods

historically  humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire  even today  biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries  biomass is all biologically-produced matter based in carbon  hydrogen and oxygen  the estimated biomass production in the world is 104.9 petagrams  104.9   1015 g  about 105 billion metric tons  of carbon per year  about half in the ocean and half on land 
wood remains the largest biomass energy source today  examples include forest residues  such as dead trees  branches and    yard clippings  wood chips and even   wood energy is derived by using lignocellulosic biomass  second-generation biofuels  as fuel  harvested wood may be used directly as a fuel or collected from wood waste streams to be processed into
or other forms of fuels  the largest source of energy from wood is pulping liquor or     a waste product from processes of the pulp  paper and paperboard industry    in the second sense  biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial   including   industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants  including                   and a variety of
species  ranging from
to
   
based on the source of biomass  biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories 
are derived from sources such as sugarcane and
starch  sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce   an alcohol fuel which can be used directly in a
to produce electricity or serve as an additive to gasoline  however  utilizing food-based resources for fuel production only aggravates the food shortage problem    on the other hand  utilize non-food-based biomass sources such as agriculture and municipal waste  these biofuels mostly consist of   which is not edible and is a low-value waste for many industries  despite being the favored alternative  economical production of second-generation biofuel is not yet achieved due to technological issues  these issues arise mainly due to chemical inertness and structural rigidity of  
plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per
with low input energy  some examples of these plants are wheat  which typically yields 7.58 tonnes of grain per hectare  and straw  which typically yields 3.55 tonnes per hectare in the uk  the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity  plant biomass can also be degraded from
to
through a series of chemical treatments  and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel 
the main contributors of
are     and   energy derived from biomass is projected to be the largest non-hydroelectric renewable resource of electricity in the us between 2000 and 2020 
biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like
and   rotting garbage  and agricultural and human waste  all release methane gas  also called
or   crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol  biodiesel  another transportation fuel  can be produced from leftover food products like vegetable oils and animal fats  several biodiesel companies simply collect used restaurant cooking oil and convert it into biodiesel  also  biomass-to-liquids  called  btls   and cellulosic ethanol are still under research 
there is research involving algae  or algae-derived  biomass  as this non-food resource can be produced at rates five to ten times those of other types of land-based agriculture  such as corn and soy  once harvested  it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as     and   as well as
and   efforts are being made to identify which species of algae are most suitable for energy production  genetic engineering approaches could also be utilized to improve microalgae as a source of biofuel 
the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region  forest by-products  such as wood residues  are common in the   agricultural waste is common in
 sugar cane residue  and
 rice husks   animal husbandry residues  such as   are common in the  
as of 2015  a new
process aimed at developing countries is under trial  the
is a self-sustaining process which uses sewerage solids as fuel in a process to convert waste water into drinking water  with surplus electrical energy being generated for export

thermal conversion  
trends in the top five countries generating electricity from biomass
are an example fuel for production of dendrothermal energy
thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form  also known as thermal oil heating  it is a type of indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system  the basic alternatives of
     and   are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed  mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature  
energy created by burning biomass  fuel wood  is particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more rapidly  e g  tropical countries  there are a number of other less common  more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such as hydrothermal upgrading  htu  and   some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass  including aqueous slurries  and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms  some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power  chp  and   in a typical dedicated biomass power plant  efficiencies range from 2027    basis   biomass cofiring with coal  by contrast  typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor  3040   higher heating value basis  
chemical conversion  
a range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms  such as to produce a fuel that is more conveniently used  transported or stored  or to exploit some property of the process itself  many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes  such as   methanol production  olefins  ethylene and propylene   and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks  in most cases  the first step involves gasification  which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk  biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid  therefore  biomass
is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of     and traces of   this gas mixture  called a   can provide fuel for various vital processes  such as   as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications  because any biomass material can undergo gasification  this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production  where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel  in addition  biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste  such as wastes available on a farm  into producer gas  which is a very usable fuel 
conversion of biomass to
can also be achieved via selective conversion of individual components of biomass  for example 
can be converted to intermediate platform chemical such a    
etc  these chemical are then further reacted to produce hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels 
biomass also has the potential to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals 
have successfully been by produced using a combination of a  fermentans and engineered s  cerevisiae  this method converts nax salts and unprocessed biomass such as   sugarcane  corn stover  or
into halomethanes  s-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in s  cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred  production levels of 150mg l-1h-1 iodomethane were achieved  at these levels roughly 173000l of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the united states need for iodomethane  however  an advantage of this method is that it uses nai rather than i2  nai is significantly less hazardous than i2  this method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future 
other chemical processes such as converting straight and waste vegetable oils into biodiesel is  
biochemical conversion  
as biomass is a natural material  many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed  and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed 
biochemical conversion makes use of the enzymes of bacteria and other microorganisms to break down biomass into gaseous or liquid fuels  such a biogas or bioethanol  in most cases  microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process      and  
electrochemical conversion  
in addition to combustion  biomass biofuels can be directly converted to electrical energy via electrochemical oxidation of the material  this can be performed directly in a  
or a microbial fuel cell  the fuel can also be consumed indirectly via a
system containing a reformer which converts the biomass into a mixture of co and h2 before it is consumed in the fuel cell 
in the united states  
the biomass power generating industry in the united states  which consists of approximately 11,000
of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid  produces about 1.4 percent of the u s  electricity supply 
currently  the new hope power partnership is the largest biomass power plant in the u s  the 140 mw facility uses sugarcane fiber    and recycled urban wood as fuel to generate enough power for its large milling and refining operations as well as to supply electricity for nearly 60,000 homes 
second-generation biofuels  
second-generation biofuels were not  in 2010  produced commercially  but a considerable number of research activities were taking place mainly in north america  europe and also in some emerging countries  these tend to use feedstock produced by rapidly reproducing
or
from various sources including
grown in
or
there is huge potential for second generation biofuels but non-edible feedstock resources are highly under-utilized 
environmental impact  
using biomass as a fuel produces
in the form of    
 nitrogen oxides   vocs     particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as
or
in some cases  such as with indoor heating and cooking   utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications 
 a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels  biofuels  and biomass  is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming  5657 in 2009 a swedish study of the
that periodically covers large areas in south asia determined that it had been principally produced by open burning of biomass  and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning  researchers measured a significant concentration of   which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels 
biomass power plant size is often driven by biomass availability in close proximity as transport costs of the  bulky  fuel play a key factor in the plant s economics  it has to be noted  however  that rail and especially shipping on waterways can reduce transport costs significantly  which has led to a global biomass market  to make small plants of 1 mwel economically profitable those power plants need to be equipped with technology that is able to convert biomass to useful electricity with high efficiency such as orc technology  a cycle similar to the water steam power process just with an organic working medium  such small power plants can be found in europe 
on combustion  the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as   the amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50  by weight  however  according to the
of the   plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth  when the biomass is from forests  the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer  and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed 
industry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plant s ability to comply with emissions standards  some of these challenges  unique to biomass plants  include inconsistent fuel supplies and age  the type and amount of the fuel supply are completely reliant factors  the fuel can be in the form of building debris or agricultural waste  such as removal of invasive species or orchard trimmings   furthermore  many of the biomass plants are old  use outdated technology and were not built to comply with todays stringent standards  in fact  many are based on technologies developed during the term of u s  president   who created the
in 1977 
the u s 
projected that by 2017  biomass is expected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas  slightly more expensive than nuclear power  and much less expensive than solar panels  in another eia study released  concerning the governments plan to implement a 25  renewable energy standard by 2025  the agency assumed that 598 million tons of biomass would be available  accounting for 12  of the renewable energy in the plan 
the adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process  between the years of 2002 and 2012 the production of these plants has increased 14   in the united states  alternative electricity-production sources on the whole generate about 13  of power  of this fraction  biomass contributes approximately 11  of the alternative production  according to a study conducted in early 2012  of the 107 operating biomass plants in the united states  85 have been cited by federal or state regulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past 5 years  this data also includes minor infractions 
despite harvesting  biomass crops may
carbon  for example  soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil  especially at depths below 12inches  the grass sequesters the carbon in its increased root biomass  typically  perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass  both living and dead  built up over years  and much less soil disruption in cultivation 
the proposal that biomass is carbon-neutral put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature  intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas  when a tree s carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse  it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades  current studies indicate that  even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage  and  the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest    
the pros and cons of biomass usage regarding carbon emissions may be quantified with the
factor  there is controversy surrounding the usage of the
factor 
forest-based biomass has recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations  including
and the   for the harmful impacts it can have on forests and the climate  greenpeace recently released a report entitled  fuelling a biomess  which outlines their concerns around forest-based biomass  because any part of the tree can be burned  the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages   which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting  and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest  in some jurisdictions  forest biomass removal is increasingly involving elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems  including standing trees  naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest  environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees  and even longer in low productivity areas  furthermore  logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon    in light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the   a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production 
supply chain issues  
with the seasonality of biomass supply and a great variability in sources  supply chains play a key role in cost-effective delivery of bioenergy  there are several potential challenges unique to bioenergy supply chains 
technical issues
inefficiencies of the conversion processes
storage methods for seasonal availability
complex multi-component constituents incompatible with maximizing efficiency of single purpose use
high water content of many biomass feedstock
conflicting decisions  technologies  locations  and routes 
complex location analysis  source points  inventory facilities  and production plants 
logistic issues
seasonal availability leading to storage challenges and or seasonally idle facilities
low bulk-density and or high water content making transportation of biomass less economical
finite productivity per area and or time incompatible with conventional approach to economy of scale focusing on maximizing facility size
financial issues
the limits for the traditional approach to economy of scale which focuses on maximizing single facility size
unavailability and complexity of life cycle costing data
lack of required transport infrastructure
limited flexibility or inflexibility to energy demand
risks associated with new technologies  insurability  performance  rate of return 
extended market volatilities  conflicts with alternative markets for biomass 
difficult or impossible to use financial hedging methods to control cost
social issues
lack of participatory decision making
lack of public community awareness
local supply chain impacts vs  global benefits
