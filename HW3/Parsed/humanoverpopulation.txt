overview  
has been growing continuously since the end of the   around the year 1350  although the most significant increase has been in the last 50 years  mainly due to
and increase in agricultural productivity  the rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s  the united nations has expressed concern on continued excessive population growth in   recent research has demonstrated that those concerns are well grounded  as of november 10  2016 the world s human population is estimated to be 7.463 by the   and over 7 billion by the   most contemporary estimates for the carrying capacity of the
under existing conditions are between 4 billion and 16 billion  depending on which estimate is used  human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred  nevertheless  the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern  the population is
to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the years 2040 and 2050  in may 2011  the united nations increased the medium variant projections to 9.3 billion for 2050 and 10.1 billion for 2100 
the recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants  the   circa 1994  stated that many environmental problems  such as rising levels of     and   are aggravated by the population expansion  other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food 
and   consumption of natural resources  such as   faster than the rate of regeneration  and a deterioration in living conditions  wealthy but highly populated territories like
rely on food imports from overseas  this was severely felt during the
when  despite food efficiency initiatives like    and   britain needed to   however  many believe that waste and   especially by wealthy nations  is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation 
most countries have no direct policy of limiting their birth rates  but the rates have still fallen due to education about family planning and increasing access to birth control and contraception  only
has imposed  
and other technical solutions have been proposed as ways to mitigate overpopulation in the future 
history of concern  
thousands of scooters make their way through    
concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic 
was a resident of the city of
in the second century   when the population of the world was about 190 million  only 3-4  of what it is today   he notably said   what most frequently meets our view  and occasions complaint  is our teeming population  our numbers are burdensome to the world  which can hardly support us     in very deed  pestilence  and famine  and wars  and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations  as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race   before that   
and others broached the topic as well 
throughout history  population growth has usually been slow despite high   due to war 
and other diseases  and high   during the 750 years before the   the world s population increased very slowly  remaining under 250 million 
by the beginning of the 19th century  the world population had grown to a billion individuals  and intellectuals such as
predicted that mankind would outgrow its available resources  because a finite amount of land would be incapable of supporting a population with a limitless potential for increase 
argued that a large population was a form of wealth  which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies 
during the 19th century  malthus s work was often interpreted in a way that blamed the poor alone for their condition and helping them was said to worsen conditions in the long run  this resulted  for example  in the
of 1834 and in a hesitating response to the
of 184552 
the un population assessment report of 2004 projects that the world population will plateau by 2050 and will remain stable until 2300 
more recent un projections suggest the population could grow to as many as 15 billion by 2100

7.7  estimate 
the human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of
in the
period  around 10,000 bce  the beginning of civilization roughly coincides with the receding of
following the end of the   it is estimated that between 1-5 million people  subsisting on hunting and   inhabited the earth in the period before the   when human activity shifted away from
and towards  
around 8000 bce  at the   the population of the world was approximately 5 million  the next several millennia saw a steady increase in the population  with very rapid growth beginning in 1000 bce  and a peak of between 200 and 300 million people in 1 bce 
the
caused
to drop by around 50  between 541 and the 8th century  steady growth resumed in 800 ce  however  growth was again disrupted by frequent   most notably  the
during the 14th century  the effects of the black death are thought to have reduced the world s population  then at an estimated 450 million  to between 350 and 375 million by 1400  the population of europe stood at over 70 million in 1340  these levels did not return until 200 years later  england s population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650  up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500  new crops from the americas via the spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the population growth 
in other parts of the globe  china s population at the founding of the
in 1368 stood close to 60 million  approaching 150 million by the end of the dynasty in 1644  the population of the americas in 1500 may have been between 50 and 100 million 
encounters between european explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local
of extraordinary virulence  archaeological evidence indicates that the death of around 90  of the
of the
was caused by
diseases such as   measles  and influenza  europeans introduced diseases alien to the indigenous people  therefore they did not have immunity to these foreign diseases 
after the start of the   during the 18th century  the rate of population growth began to increase  by the end of the century  the world s population was estimated at just under 1 billion  at the turn of the 20th century  the world s population was roughly 1.6 billion  by 1940  this figure had increased to 2.3 billion

there is concern over the sharp population increase in many countries  especially in   that has occurred over the last several decades  and that it is creating problems with land management  natural resources and access to water supplies 
the population of
has  for example  grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009         
and the

have further strained the resources of neighboring states like chad and egypt  chad is also host to roughly 255,000

according to projections  the world population will continue to grow until at least 2050  with the population reaching 9 billion in 2040  and some
putting the population as high as 11 billion in 2050  by 2100  the population could reach 15 billion 
projected in the 1950s that world population would reach a peak of about nine billion  in the 21st century  and then stop growing  after a readjustment of the
and a sanitation of the tropics 
according to the united nations  world population prospects report 
the
is currently growing by approximately 74 million people per year  current united nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach 9.0 billion around 2050  assuming a decrease in average
from 2.5 down to 2.0 
almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions  where today s 5.3 billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to 7.8 billion in 2050  by contrast  the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged  at 1.2 billion  an exception is the united states population  which is expected to increase by 44  from 2008 to 2050 
in 20002005  the average world fertility was 2.65 children per woman  about half the level in 19501955  5 children per woman   in the medium variant  global fertility is projected to decline further to 2.05 children per woman 
during 20052050  nine countries are expected to account for half of the world s projected population increase    pakistan    democratic republic of the congo    uganda  united states  ethiopia  and china  listed according to the size of their contribution to population growth  china would be higher still in this list were it not for its  
global life expectancy at birth is expected to continue rising from 65 years in 20002005 to 75 years in 20452050  in the more developed regions  the projection is to 82 years by 2050  among the least developed countries  where life expectancy today is just under 50 years  it is expected to increase to 66 years by 20452050 
the population of 51 countries or areas is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005 
during 20052050  the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be 98 million  because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by 73 million during 20052050  population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration 
in 20002005  net migration in 28 countries either prevented
or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase  births minus deaths  to population growth 
are now falling in a small percentage of   while the actual populations in many
would fall without immigration 
urban growth  
urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006  3  of the world s population lived in cities in 1800  rising to 47  at the end of the twentieth century 
in 1800 only 3  of the
lived in cities  by the 20th century s close  47  did so  in 1950 there were 83 cities with populations exceeding one million  but by 2007 this had risen to 468 agglomerations of more than one million  if the trend continues  the world s
will double every 38 years  according to researchers  the un forecasts that today s urban population of 3.2 billion will rise to nearly 5 billion by 2030  when three out of five people will live in cities 
the increase will be most dramatic in the poorest and least-urbanised continents  asia and africa  projections indicate that most urban growth over the next 25 years will be in   one billion people  one-seventh of the world s population  or one-third of urban population  now live in   which are seen as  breeding grounds  for social problems such as crime      alcoholism  poverty and unemployment  in many poor countries 
exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions  malnutrition  and lack of basic health care 
in 2000  there were 18 
such as tokyo          mexico city    so paulo and new york city that have populations in excess of 10 million inhabitants 
already has 35 million  more than the entire population of canada  at 34.1 million  
according to the far eastern economic review  asia alone will have at least 10  hypercities  by 2025  that is  cities inhabited by more than 19 million people  including
 24.9 million people  
 25 million  
 26.5 million  
 27 million  and
 33 million  
has grown from 300,000 in 1950 to an estimated 15 million today  and the nigerian government estimates that city will have expanded to 25 million residents by 2015  chinese experts forecast that chinese cities will contain 800 million people by 2020 
causes  
street in
from a historical perspective 
have coincided with population explosions  there have been three major technological revolutions  the tool-making revolution  the   and the
 all of which allowed humans more access to food  resulting in subsequent population explosions  for example  the use of tools  such as bow and arrow  allowed primitive hunters greater access to high energy foods  e g  animal meat   similarly  the transition to farming about 10,000 years ago greatly increased the overall food supply  which was used to support more people  food production further increased with the
as machinery      and
were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields  in short  similar to
that multiply in response to increased food supply  humans have increased their population as soon as food became more abundant as a result of technological innovations 
significant increases in human population occur whenever the
exceeds the
for extended periods of time  traditionally  the fertility rate is strongly influenced by cultural and social norms that are rather stable and therefore slow to adapt to changes in the social  technological  or environmental conditions  for example  when death rates fell during the 19th and 20th century  as a result of improved sanitation  child immunizations  and other advances in medicine  allowing more newborns to survive  the fertility rate did not adjust downward fast enough  resulting in significant population growth  prior to these changes  seven out of ten children died before reaching reproductive age  while today about 95  of newborns in industrialized nations reach adulthood 
agriculture  
this section needs expansion  you can help by    february 2014 
has been the main factor behind human population growth  this dates back to prehistoric times  when agricultural methods were first developed  and continues to the present day  with fertilizers  agrochemicals  large-scale mechanization  genetic manipulation  and other technologies 
psychological factors  
human
and the cycle of entrenched   as well as the rest of the world s reaction to it  are also causative factors  areas with greater burden of disease and warfare  contrary to popular belief  do not experience less population growth over the long term  but far more over a sustained period as poverty becomes further entrenched

         as this cycle is compounded over generations  calamities such as disaster or war take on a   for example  the
is said to have killed 30 million to date  yet during the last two decades money and initiatives to lower population growth by contraception have been sidelined in favor of combating   feeding the population explosion that we see in africa today  in 1990  this continent s population was roughly 600 million  today it is over 1,050 million  150 million more than if the hiv aids crisis had never occurred 
extremes  
population growth rates between 1950 and 2012 range from a 0.5  increase in the case of bulgaria to a more than 100 fold increase for the united arab emirates  from 79,050 to 8.5 million   roughly half of all nations have quadrupled their populations since 1950 
demographic transition  
main articles 
and
the theory of demographic transition held that  after the
and
increase 
and
decline  however  as new data has become available  it has been observed that after a certain level of development   equal to 0.86 or higher  the fertility increases again  this means that both the worry that the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth are misguided 
factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage  the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside
and domestic work  and the decreased need of children in industrialized settings  the latter factor stems from the fact that children
in small-scale agricultural societies  and work less in industrial ones  it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions 
many countries have high population growth rates but lower
because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age  so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity     
 demographic entrapment  is a concept developed by maurice king  honorary research fellow at the   who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity  no possibility of migration  and exports too little to be able to import food  this will cause starvation  he claims that for example many sub-saharan nations are or will become stuck in demographic entrapment  instead of having a demographic transition 
for the world as a whole  the number of
decreased from 5.02 to 2.65 between 1950 and 2005  a breakdown by region is as follows 
europe  2.66 to 1.41
north america  3.47 to 1.99
oceania  3.87 to 2.30
central america  6.38 to 2.66
south america  5.75 to 2.49
asia  excluding middle east   5.85 to 2.43
middle east   north africa  6.99 to 3.37
sub-saharan africa  6.7 to 5.53
excluding the observed reversal in fertility decrease for high development  the projected world number of children born per woman for 2050 would be around 2.05  only the middle east   north africa  2.09  and sub-saharan africa  2.61  would then have numbers greater than 2.05 
carrying capacity  
main article 
a
placard in   it shows some negative effects of having too many children 
some groups  for example  the
and   have stated that the carrying capacity for the human population has been exceeded as measured using the   in 2006   s    stated that in order for all humans to live with the current consumption patterns of europeans  we would be spending three times more than what the planet can renew  humanity as a whole was using  by 2006  40 percent more than what earth can regenerate  however 
of
states the view   the poor want to get rich  and i want them to get rich   with a later addition   of course we have to change consumption habits     but we ve also got to stabilise our numbers  
but critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating ecological footprints  therefore  global footprint network and its partner organizations have engaged with national governments and international agencies to test the results  reviews have been produced by france  germany  the european commission  switzerland  luxembourg  japan and the united arab emirates  some point out that a more refined method of assessing ecological footprint is to designate sustainable versus non-sustainable categories of consumption  however  if yield estimates were adjusted for sustainable levels of production  the yield figures would be lower  and hence the
estimated by the ecological footprint method even higher 
other studies give particular attention to
and increased world affluence   
in a 1994 study titled food  land  population and the u s  economy 
and
estimated the maximum
for a
at 200 million  and in order to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster  the united states would have to reduce its population by at least one-third  and
would have to be reduced by two-thirds 
many quantitative studies have estimated the world s carrying capacity for humans  that is  a limit to the world population  a meta-analysis of 69 such studies suggests a point estimate of the limit to be 7.7 billion people  while lower and upper meta-bounds for current technology are estimated as 0.65 and 98 billion people  respectively  they conclude   recent predictions of stabilized world population levels for 2050 exceed several of our meta-estimates of a world population limit  
effects of human overpopulation  
main article 
humanity s overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides raw population  the lifestyle  including overall affluence and resource utilization  and the pollution  including   are equally important  in 2008  the
stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world  who make up the majority of the human population 
some problems associated with or exacerbated by human overpopulation and over-consumption are 
inadequate fresh water for
as well as
and
discharge  some countries  like   use energy-expensive
to solve the problem of water shortages 
depletion of natural resources  especially  
world energy consumption   predictions  19702025 
increased levels of air pollution   
and   once a country has industrialized and become wealthy  a combination of government regulation and technological innovation causes pollution to decline substantially  even as the population continues to grow 
deforestation and loss of ecosystems that valuably contribute to the global atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide balance  about eight million hectares of forest are lost each year 
changes in atmospheric composition and consequent  
loss of
and increase in   deforestation and desertification can be reversed by adopting property rights  and this policy is successful even while the human population continues to grow 
from reduced habitat in
due to
techniques that sometimes are practiced by   especially in countries with rapidly expanding rural populations  present
rates may be as high as 140,000
lost per year  as of february 2011  the
lists a total of 801 animal species having gone extinct during recorded human history 
high infant and child mortality  high rates of infant mortality are associated with poverty  rich countries with high population densities have low rates of infant mortality 
intensive

diseases  excessive air and water pollution  and new viruses that infect humans     1972
increased chance of the emergence of new
and   for many environmental and social reasons  including overcrowded living conditions 
and inadequate  inaccessible  or non-existent health care  the poor are more likely to be exposed to  
 
or poor diet with ill health and diet-deficiency diseases  e g     however  rich countries with high population densities do not have famine 
poverty coupled with inflation in some regions and a resulting low level of capital formation  poverty and inflation are aggravated by bad government and bad economic policies  many countries with high population densities have eliminated absolute poverty and keep their inflation rates very low 
low
in countries with fastest growing populations 
unhygienic living conditions for many based upon water resource depletion  discharge of raw sewage and solid waste disposal  however  this problem can be reduced with the adoption of sewers  for example  after
installed sewers  its infant mortality rate fell substantially 
elevated crime rate due to drug cartels and increased theft by people stealing resources to survive 
conflict over scarce resources and crowding  leading to increased levels of warfare 
less personal freedom and more restrictive laws  laws regulate interactions between humans  law  serves as a primary social mediator of relations between people     the higher the population density  the more frequent such interactions become  and thus there develops a need for more laws and or more restrictive laws to regulate these interactions  it was even speculated by
in 1958 that democracy is threatened due to overpopulation  and could give rise to
style governments 
described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems 
many of these problems are explored in the dystopic science fiction film   where an overpopulated earth suffers from food shortages  depleted resources and poverty and in the documentary    
some economists  such as
and
argue that third world poverty and
are caused in part by bad government and bad economic policies  most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life  some   such as the radical thinker and polemicist   see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire  
resources  
overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population  but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources  it also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population 
the resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include   clean air  food  shelter  warmth  and other resources necessary to sustain life  if the quality of human life is addressed  there may be additional resources considered  such as medical care  education  proper  
and energy supplies  overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources  leading to a diminished quality of life 
directly related to maintaining the health of the human population is water supply  and it is one of the resources that experience the biggest strain  with the global population at about 7.125 billion  and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water  there is a demand for 14.25 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living  united   weather patterns  elevation  and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water  without clean water  good health is not a viable option  besides drinking  water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life  in addition to drinking water  water is also used for bathing  washing clothes and dishes  flushing toilets  a variety of cleaning methods  recreation  watering lawns  and farm irrigation  irrigation poses one of the largest problems  because without sufficient water to irrigate crops  the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation  in addition to water needed for crops and food  there is limited land area dedicated to food production  and not much more that is suitable to be added  arable land  needed to sustain the growing population  is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply  there are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population  bashford 240   access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth  no increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict  only 38  of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture  and there is not room for much more  although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year  when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050  the plants may not be able to keep up  biello   food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded  by trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land  the soil becomes exhausted  because the soil is exhausted  it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before  and is overall less productive  therefore  by using resources beyond a sustainable level  the resource become nullified and ineffective  which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource  there must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles 
an industrial area  with a power plant  south of  s downtown 
has stated that  with the imbalance growing between population numbers and vital life sustaining resources  humans must actively conserve cropland  freshwater  energy  and biological resources  there is a need to develop renewable energy resources  humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the earth s resources and diminishes human well-being  
these reflect the comments also of the
in their paper    as the global population continues to grow   people will place greater and greater demands on the resources of our planet  including mineral and   open space    and plant and animal resources    earth s natural wealth  an audit  by
magazine states that many of the minerals that we use for a variety of products are in danger of running out in the near future  a handful of geologists around the world have calculated the costs of new technologies in terms of the materials they use and the implications of their spreading to the developing world  all agree that the planet s booming population and rising standards of living are set to put unprecedented demands on the materials that only earth itself can provide  limitations on how much of these materials is available could even mean that some technologies are not worth pursuing long term      virgin stocks of several metals appear inadequate to sustain the modern  developed world  quality of life for all of earth s people under contemporary technology  
on the other hand  some
researchers  such as
and
believe that resources exist for further population growth  in a 2010 study  they concluded that  there are not  and will never be  too many people for the planet to feed  according to   some critics warn  this will be at a high cost to the earth   the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decades    however  the environmental cost of what paul r  and anne h  ehrlich describe as  turning the earth into a giant human feedlot  could be severe  a large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further   loss of     and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production   since we are intimately dependent upon the living systems of the earth  some scientists have questioned the wisdom of further expansion 
according to the   a four-year research effort by 1,360 of the world s prominent scientists commissioned to measure the actual value of natural resources to humans and the world   the structure of the world s ecosystems changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at any time in recorded human history  and virtually all of earth s ecosystems have now been significantly transformed through human actions    ecosystem services  particularly food production  timber and fisheries  are important for employment and economic activity  intensive use of ecosystems often produces the greatest short-term advantage  but excessive and unsustainable use can lead to losses in the long term  a country could cut its forests and deplete its fisheries  and this would show only as a positive gain to gdp  despite the loss of capital assets  if the full economic value of ecosystems were taken into account in decision-making  their degradation could be significantly slowed down or even reversed  
another study by the
 unep  called the
which involved 1,400 scientists and took five years to prepare comes to similar conclusions  it  found that human consumption had far outstripped available resources  each person on earth now requires a third more land to supply his or her needs than the planet can supply     it faults a failure to  respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet     the systematic destruction of the earth s natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged  and where the bill we hand to our children may prove impossible to pay     the report s authors say its objective is  not to present a dark and gloomy scenario  but an urgent call to action   it warns that tackling the problems may affect the vested interests of powerful groups  and that the environment must be moved to the core of decision-making       
although all resources  whether mineral or other  are limited on the planet  there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced  for example  in 1990 known reserves of many natural resources were higher  and their prices lower  than in 1970  despite higher demand and higher consumption  whenever a price spike would occur  the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology

supplies  on which agriculture depends  are running low worldwide  this
is only expected to worsen as the population increases 
potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below  however  the majority of the world s freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps  and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells 
fresh water can be obtained from salt water by   for example 
derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination  a number of
desalination plants exist  however  the high costs of desalination  especially for poor countries  make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries  the cost of desalination varies 
is now desalinating water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter 
at 49 cents per cubic meter  in the united states  the cost is 81 cents per cubic meter   3.06 for 1,000 gallons  
according to a 2004 study by zhou and tol   one needs to lift the water by 2000 m  or transport it over more than 1600km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs  desalinated water is expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high  such as
and   in other places  the dominant cost is desalination  not transport  this leads to somewhat lower costs in places like beijing        and  of course  coastal cities like    thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans  it concludes that  desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions  but not for places that are poor  deep in the interior of a continent  or at high elevation  unfortunately  that includes some of the places with biggest water problems   another potential problem with desalination is the byproduction of saline   which can be a major cause of marine pollution when dumped back into the oceans at high temperatures  
the world s largest desalination plant is the
desalination plant  phase 2  in the   which can produce 300 million cubic metres of water per year  or about 2500 gallons per second  the largest desalination plant in the us is the one at   florida  which began desalinating 25 million gallons  95000 m  of water per day in december 2007  a 17 january 2008  article in the
states   worldwide  13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day  according to the international desalination association   after being desalinated at   saudi arabia  water is pumped 200 miles  320km  inland though a pipeline to the capital city of  
however  new data originating from the
experiments and isotopic testing done by the
show that the which is under the largest  driest part of the earth s surface  has enough water in it to provide for  at least several centuries   in addition to this  new and highly detailed maps of the earth s underground reservoirs will be soon created from these technologies that will further allow proper budgeting of cheap water 
food  
some scientists argue that there is enough food to support the world population  and some dispute this  particularly if sustainability is taken into account 
many countries rely heavily on imports 
and
rely on imports for 40  of their grain supply 
and
import more than 90   and just 6 countries    australia  canada  france 
and the usa  supply 90  of grain exports  in recent decades the us alone supplied almost half of world grain exports 
a 2001 united nations report says population growth is  the main force driving increases in agricultural demand  but  most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future  that is to say  until approximately 2030 or 2050    assuming declining population growth rates 
however  the observed figures for 2007 show an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world  923 million in 2007 versus 832 million in 1995   the more recent fao estimates point to an even more dramatic increase  to 1.02 billion in 2009 
global perspective  
further information 
growth in food production has been greater than population growth 
the amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed  and their distribution is not necessarily a   for example  due to the
and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes  the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until 1995  world food production per person was considerably higher in 2005 than 1961 
as world population doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion  daily
consumption in poor countries increased from 1,932 to 2,650  and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45  to 18   this suggests that third world poverty and famine are caused by underdevelopment  not overpopulation  however  others question these statistics  from 1950 to 1984  as the
transformed agriculture around the world  grain production increased by over 250   the world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the green revolution and most believe that  without the revolution  there would be greater
and
than the un presently documents 
the number of
has surpassed the number who are undernourished  in a 2006 news story 
reported   there are an estimated 800 million undernourished people and more than a billion considered overweight worldwide   the u s  has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world  however  studies show that wealthy and educated people are far likelier to eat healthy food  indicating obesity is a disease related to poverty and lack of education and excessive advertising of unhealthy eatables at cheaper cost  high in calories  with little nutritive value are consumed 
percentage of population suffering from malnutrition by country  according to united nations statistics 
the
of the united nations states in its report the state of food insecurity in the world 2006  that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million  a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in 199092  17  against 20   furthermore  fao s projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from 199092 levels to 10  by 2015  the fao also states  we have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community  the world is richer today than it was ten years ago  there is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices  the knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there  what is lacking is sufficient political will to mobilize those resources to the benefit of the hungry

 fao   food supplies will need to be increased by 70  by 2050 to meet projected demands

population as a function of food availability  
thinkers from a wide range of academic fields and political backgroundsincluding agricultural scientist david pimentel  behavioral scientist russell hopfenberg  right-wing anthropologist   ecologist   ecologist and anthropologist   journalist   environmental biologist alan d  thornhill  cultural critic and writer   and
 propose that  like all other animal populations  human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply  growing during an abundance of food and shrinking in times of scarcity 
proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased  the population grows  most human populations throughout history validate this theory  as does the overall current global population  populations of
fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food  the world human population began increasing after the
and its increased food supply  this was  subsequent to the   followed by even more severely accelerated population growth  which continues today  often  wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities  however  proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run  peter farb  for example  has commented on the paradox that  intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population   daniel quinn has also focused on this phenomenon  which he calls the     comparable  in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe  to the   
critics of this theory point out that  in the modern era  birth rates are lowest in the   which also have the highest access to food  in fact  some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply  the united nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas  including germany  italy  japan  and most of the states of the former soviet union  is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005    this shows that  limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary  particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply  however  the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major exporters of food to poorer populations  so that   it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas  allaby  1984  pimentel et al   1999  that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled  
regardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability  the
is  on the global scale  undeniably increasing  as is the net quantity of human food produced  a pattern that has been true for roughly 10,000 years  since the human development of agriculture  the fact that some affluent countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory as whole  since the world has become a
with food moving across national borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity  hopfenberg and pimentel s findings support both this and quinn s direct accusation that  first world farmers are fueling the third world population explosion   additionally  the hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by any single case study  as in germany s recent population trends  clearly other factors are at work to limit the population in wealthier areas

percentages of the earth s surface covered by water  dedicated to agriculture  under conversion  intact  and used for human habitation  while humans ourselves occupy only 0.05  of the earth s total area  our effects are felt on over one-quarter of the land

has affected some 3.3 billion  hectares   roughly 26 percent of the land area  all totaled  agriculture has displaced one-third of
and
and one-quarter of natural grasslands   forty percent of the land area is under conversion and fragmented  less than one quarter  primarily in the arctic and the deserts  remains intact  usable land may become less useful through         and  
may cause flooding of many of the most productive agricultural areas  the development of energy sources may also require large areas  for example  the building of   thus  available useful land may become a limiting factor  by most estimates  at least half of cultivable land is already being farmed  and there are concerns that the remaining reserves are greatly overestimated

agriculture  even with the modern techniques of agriculture  the sustainability of production is in question 
some countries  such as the

to grow food inside skyscrapers  the notion that space is limited has been decried by skeptics  who point out that the earth s population of roughly 6.8 billion people could comfortably be housed an area comparable in size to the state of texas  in the united states  about 269,000 square miles or 696,706.80 square kilometres   however  the impact of humanity extends over a far greater area than that required simply for housing

overpopulation in various countries has become a serious threat to the health of people and a grave obstacle to any attempt to organize peace on this planet 
 physicist 1879  1955

it has been suggested that overpopulation leads to increased levels of tensions both between and within countries  modern usage of the term
supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment  the   
criticism of this hypothesis  
the
that population pressure causes increased
has been recently criticized on the empirical grounds  both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare    in collaboration with   has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis 
population and warfare are dynamical variables  and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations  then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time  that is  unlagged   korotayev and turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare  focusing on internal warfare  might be in both stateless and state societies  next  they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies  early modern england 
and
china  and the   their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory  that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase  with warfare peaks following population peaks  
furthermore  they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory  population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity  while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density 
mitigation measures  
there are several mitigation measures that have been or can be applied to reduce overpopulation  all of these mitigations are ways to implement social norms  overpopulation is an issue that threatens the state of the environment in the above-mentioned ways and therefore societies must make a change in order to reverse some of the environmental effects brought on by current social norms  in societies like china  the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple  other societies have already begun to implement social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects   the intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost  a variety of print materials  flyers  brochures  fact sheets  stickers  needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship  sporting events  local food markets  schools and at car parks  taxis   bus stands   
such prompts work to introduce the problem so that social norms are easier to implement  certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods  an example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is afghanistan   the approval by afghan president hamid karzai of the shia personal status law in march 2009 effectively destroyed shia women s rights and freedoms in afghanistan  under this law  women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill  and can be denied food if they do  
education and empowerment  
one option is to focus on education about overpopulation    and
methods  and to make birth-control devices like male and
 
and
easily available  worldwide  nearly 40  of
 some 80 million unintended pregnancies each year   an estimated 350 million women in the poorest countries of the world either did not want their last child  do not want another child or want to space their pregnancies  but they lack access to information  affordable means and services to determine the size and spacing of their families  in the united states  in 2001  almost half of   in the   some 514,000 women die annually of complications from pregnancy and abortion  with 86  of these deaths occurring in the
region and south asia  additionally  8 million infants die  many because of
or preventable diseases  especially from lack of access to clean drinking water 
and their
in particular are issues regarded to have vital importance in the debate 
 the only ray of hope i can see  and it s not much  is that wherever women are put in control of their lives  both politically and socially  where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions  birth rate falls  women don t want to have 12 kids of whom nine will die

the business magnate
proposed a  voluntary  non-imposed  one-child family scenario  a    campaign is run by
 a uk population concern organisation   in which people are encouraged to limit themselves to small family size 
birth regulations  
overpopulation is related to the issue of   some nations  like the people s republic of china  use strict measures to reduce birth rates  religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty 
  son of late prime minister of india   implemented a forced
programme between 1975 and 1977  officially  men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization  but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men  some unmarried young men  political opponents and ignorant men were also believed to have been sterilized    this program is still remembered and criticized in india  and is blamed for creating a public aversion to   which hampered government programmes for decades 
urban designer
has proposed a  choice-based  marketable birth license plan  he calls     birth credits would allow any woman to have as many children as she wants  as long as she buys a license for any children beyond an average allotment that would result in   if that allotment was determined to be one child  for example  then the first child would be free  and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost  extra credits would expire after a certain time  so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators  the actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual   so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society 
another choice-based approach  similar to arth s birth credits  is financial compensation or other benefits  free goods and or services  by the state  or state-owned companies  offered to people who voluntarily undergo   such compensation has been offered in the past by the government of india 
in 2014 the united nations estimated there is an 80  likelihood that the world s population will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion by 2100  most of the world s expected population increase will be in africa and southern asia  africa s population is expected to rise from the current one billion to three or four billion by 2100  and asia could add another billion in the same period  because the median age of africans is so low  e g 
  15 years old  birth credits would have to limit fertility to one child per two women to reach the levels of developed countries immediately  for countries with a wide base in their population pyramid it will take a generation for the people who are of child bearing age to have their families  an example of
is china  which added perhaps 400,000 more people after its one-child policy was enacted  arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries 
infectious agents  
there are also natural diseases  such as  
and even some diseases that produce no physical discomfort at all  such as some specific   that may also cause sterilization of males and or females in the population  whereas the natural occurrence of these diseases is not sufficient to significantly reduce the population problem  large-scale production of these diseases and human-induced release of such diseases could quite well be used as a mitigation measure

various scientists and
authors have contemplated that overpopulation on earth may be remedied in the future by the use of extraterrestrial settlements  in the 1970s 
suggested building
that could support 30,000 times the carrying capacity of earth using just the asteroid belt  and that the
as a whole could sustain current population growth rates for a thousand years 
 1992  1994  has projected a human population of five
 5 x 1018  throughout the solar system by 3000  with the majority in the  
 1999  favours the
as the future home of humanity  suggesting this could happen within a few centuries  in  
suggests that the resources of the solar system could support 10
 1016  people  in an interview 
claimed that overpopulation is a threat to human existence and  our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet earth but to spread out into space  
  famous inventor of the futuristic concept of   has suggested in
that colonizing space will mean breaking the

it may be possible for other parts of the solar system to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future 
of  s
in particular has pointed out that   at  cloud-top level  venus is the paradise planet   as one could construct
habitats and
there easily  based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense

 see   
many
authors  including     and   have argued that shipping any excess population into space is not a viable solution to human overpopulation  according to clarke   the population battle must be fought or won here on earth   the problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space  as shown in books such as mining the sky   but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to  solve  overpopulation on earth  however   s calculations show that earth could offload all new population growth with a launch services industry about the same size as the current airline industry 
the
concept  by
 the co-inventor of
transport  and others  envisions a capability to send up to 4 million people a decade to space per facility  ahypothetical extraterrestrial colony could potentially grow by reproduction only  i e   without any immigration   with all of the inhabitants being the direct descendants of the original colonists 
urbanization  
despite the increase in population density within cities  and the emergence of megacities  
states in its reports that urbanization may be the best compromise in the face of global population growth  cities concentrate human activity within limited areas  limiting the breadth of environmental damage  but this mitigating influence can only be achieved if
is significantly improved and city services are properly maintained
