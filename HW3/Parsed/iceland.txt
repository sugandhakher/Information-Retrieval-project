administrative divisions  
main article 
iceland is divided into regions  constituencies and municipalities  the eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes  district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division  until 2003  the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions  but by an amendment to the constitution  they were changed to the current six constituencies 
and
 city regions  
 four
suburban areas around reykjavk  
and
 northern half of iceland  split   and 
 southern half of iceland  excluding reykjavk and suburbs  
the redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country  since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the reykjavk city area  the imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system  but still exists 
74 municipalities in iceland govern local matters like schools  transport  and zoning  these are the actual
of iceland  as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes  reykjavk is by far the most populous municipality  about four times more populous than   the second one
