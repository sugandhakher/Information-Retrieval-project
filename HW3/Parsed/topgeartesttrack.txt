the top gear test track is used by the
automotive television programme   it is located at
in   united kingdom  the track was designed by
as a testing facility for the -run company  with many of its
cars tested there  it is used to test both cars and drivers seen on the programme  mainly in power laps and star in a reasonably priced car 
for the
of top gear the track was expanded with a
section for the new  star in a rallycross car  segment 
contents
layout  
the track is on a former
airbase constructed during the
and later used by
as a manufacturing and test facility  the track s main route  marked by painted lines and simple structures such as stacks of tyres  was designed by test drivers from   the layout of the track is designed to put the car through various conditions  ranging from provoking
to testing brake balance and tyres  the track is approximately 1.75 miles  2.82km  long  it is considered to be an equaliser for cars since  according to   both 060 miles per hour  096.6km h  times and top speed are totally meaningless  the track also incorporates a   although this is not used for timed segments  it does feature in some challenges and other features on the show 
the course starts on the perimeter road outside the top gear studio  the first bend is a fast right-left kink named   curves     bend  is the first proper turn on the track and the first corner usually seen when
is lapping a car      a long right-hand around a tyre wall onto the main runway  was designed by lotus as a   designed to highlight understeer or
of the chassis  next is  hammerhead   a left-then-right corner  which again highlights understeer and oversteer  the track comes to a right-hand curve  then the course turns right through the flat-out section called the  follow through   after the left hand  bentley bend  named after the person who first  discovered 
and former top gear presenter    but commonly referred to simply as  the tyres   the course comes to   bend   which  after the first series  has been referred to as the  penultimate corner  or the  second-to-last corner  and is often regarded as one of the most challenging on the course  the final turn before the finish line is  gambon  in honour of   who completed the turn on two wheels in episode 8 of   prior to this  the corner was known as   corner  
usage  
the track is used routinely for the star in a reasonably-priced car and power laps segments on top gear  it also serves myriad roles in other portions of the programme  especially in testing cars and in challenges  when testing cars  they are often driven around the airfield by the presenters  afterwards  they are taken around the test track by the stig to set a lap time  occasionally  drag races and speed tests are held on the runway 
cars acquired during challenges must often post lap times  driven by either one of the presenters or the stig  around the track against either a target time or a time set by the stig in another vehicle  during many challenges  the track is used in more unorthodox fashions  for instance  serving as a makeshift motorway lane during a challenge testing tailgating prowess with vans 
power laps  
top gear test track
power laps is a segment of the programme in which the stig completes a lap around the track in a reviewed car to compare its performance to previous contenders 
to be eligible to appear on the power lap times board  a vehicle must be a road-legal production car and must have sufficient ride height to clear a standard
 referred to by the presenters as a sleeping policeman   although occasionally vehicles that cannot appear on the list are still timed  whenever a
is raced  the time is compared to the official power laps but then removed from the board  for example - the
owned by
 1 10.7  was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used  
all laps are timed with the car s manufacturer-provided adjustable settings configured for maximum performance  all adjustable suspensions are set at their most efficient  all gear shift maps are at their most aggressive  and driving aids such as traction control are deactivated  lap times do not offer complete comparisons between the cars  mainly because wet or otherwise poor weather conditions  see
below  can negatively affect lap times

the second most powerful production car ever featured on top gear  the 1001 ps  987bhp  736kw    was taken around the track by the stig in series 12  episode 4  after 3 years of waiting  however  it disappointed the team by only managing fifth place on the power board  currently 16th   an unexpectedly low position ultimately attributed to the car s
of 1,888kg  4,162lb   more than any of the four faster cars  in series 15 episode 5 however  the stig took the 1,200 ps
version around the track in 1 16.8  thus setting a new lap record 
for the 1 17.6 lap  the
 written as  koeniggggsenisseggsegnignigsegigisegccx2 with the top gear wing  on a much-longer magnetic strip  because none of the presenters were able to spell koenigsegg  was fitted with an optional rear spoiler to provide
after the stig spun the unmodified version off the track  the stig allegedly recommended this modification  correctly predicting that the car would then be the fastest ever round the track  although koenigsegg stated that the improvement was due to other adjustments 
lap times of non-qualifying vehicles  
a  non-qualifying  vehicle is one that does not meet the presenters  requirements to remain on the board  that is  one that is not a  road car   which according to top gear means being  available to buy  fully road-legal  lights  indicators  registration  profile tyres  etc    and street-worthy  i e  able to negotiate a

the caparo  radical  and westfield are road-legal in the uk but are unable to clear a speed bump  according to caparo  the car driven by top gear was a prototype that didn t feature the adjustable ride height found on the production model  because the stig set his time in the non-adjustable prototype and the production version has not been driven around the track  the caparo s time remains ineligible for the power lap board 
non-top gear laps  
occasionally attempts at the power lap record are made without the support of the bbc  the following laps of dunsfold were recorded  filmed and promoted independently of the top gear television programme

ultima claim that their motive for running a non-televised lap was that they felt that the gtr was being specifically ignored by the producers of top gear  why dunlop  injection chose to run a lap of the dunsfold circuit is not stated  although it is noticeable that the slower  official  caterham run was limited by cold tyres 
celebrity laps  
star in a reasonably priced car  series 1-22   
star in a reasonably priced car was a recurring segment on top gear  during most programmes  a celebrity  usually  but not exclusively of british fame  is interviewed by jeremy clarkson  discussion is normally amusing  and focuses on car-related matters  such as the celebrity s car history  then clarkson and the studio audience watch the guest s fastest lap on the top gear test track  after which clarkson puts the celebrity s time on the time board 
suzuki liana  20022005   
top gear s suzuki liana
for the first seven series the car driven for lap times was a   when first introduced  the car was worth 9995  the car used is stock except for a
and racing seats added as safety measures  each guest practises with the stig before making several attempts to complete the test track in the fastest time  the guest does not learn their time until the interview  practice laps  crashes and the drivers  facial expressions are also shown during the segment 
the two slowest laps on the liana celebrity list are held by
and   both of whom were beaten by   a
veteran who is completely blind  he guided the liana through the track under direction from clarkson in the passenger seat in a time of 2 minutes 2 seconds  which was 1.4 seconds quicker than terry wogan  and 4 seconds faster than richard whiteley 
the fastest non-professional driver was   unlike most contenders she made no comments to the camera during her lap  she completed the lap in 1 minute 46.7 seconds  beating
by 0.2 seconds  the current fastest professional driver in the liana is
with 1 42.2 
the liana endured considerable abuse from the stars while undertaking their laps  in one incident  actor
clipped the final corner  taking the car onto two wheels  it was done in such a spectacular fashion that the corner was named  gambon corner   when
drove the liana  one of the front wheels fell off  invoking clarkson to coin the term  pulling a lionel  
also lost a wheel  the former british transport minister
added further injury to the liana by denting the boot when he lost control during practice and slid backwards into a tyre wall 
destroyed the gearbox of two lianas during his time on the show due to his rough driving style 
broke the liana s front suspension during series 4 when he drove on the grass 
was the only celebrity to use a liana with an automatic transmission  because a hesitant eccleston admitted he was  only qualified to drive an automatic   to accommodate his needs  top gear succeeded in borrowing an automatic liana  of which only 40 existed in the uk  as a reference to his role in   the automatic liana was shown materialising onto the racing track  with a
materialisation sound effect played over it 
the liana has also been modified on several occasions  david soul s liana featured a red police light and a white stripe in reference to his
role 
was provided with
as he had not passed his driving test at the time  when
came on the show  the liana he drove had flame decals pasted on it  actor
had an ornate tissue box placed in the back  an homage to indian drivers 
in its service  the liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit  went through 400 tyres  its brakes were changed 100 times  and it required six new clutches  two new hubs  driveshafts  wishbones  struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror 
in july 2005 
driver
appeared on the show for the first time as the star  this was kept a surprise to the audience and the viewing public  and when
came on the show  it was covered up in magazines and on the internet by saying that the star in a reasonably priced car would be   since mansell s appearance the liana has remained in use as a vehicle reserved for formula 1 drivers 
for some of the laps more than one person has been present in the car  this was the case for clarkson s run when he had both hammond and
in the car 
were both in the car for each other s runs 
was in the car when
did his lap  van outen never did a lap driving the car  clarkson was also present as a navigator for billy baxter s laps

starting with the eighth series the liana was replaced by a
and a new blank scoreboard  the format was changed so that each star would have five practice laps  and then a final timed lap  with no allowance being given for mishaps 
as a starter for the new car and format  an open day was held for any celebrity who wanted to take part  seven stars recorded times that day 
 who jeremy and richard referred to as the  well spoken man  after failing to recognise him   comedians
and   rock stars
and   footballer   and actor
who topped the time at 1 minute 47.0 seconds    who held second place in the liana behind   spun off while doing his timed lap and got the second to one slowest time ever around the track at 2 minutes  8.91 seconds 
on 28 january 2007 
posted a time of 1 47.70 in melted snow and standing water  given the rivalry oliver felt towards fellow celebrity chef  and then-lapboard leader    oliver asked that the 4-second allowance normally granted for wet laps be used to put him at the top of the leaderboard  just for a day  
actress
posted a time of 1 48.3 but was deemed by the stig to have failed to complete a lap properly  as she failed to negotiate some corners  the stig suggested a three-second time penalty  but after clarkson consulted the audience  it was decided to let the time stand  which her
co-star    tried to overturn on 23 december 2007 show  at the end of the following series  clarkson remarked that if tennant had worn a see through top  like piper for her interview   he  would have been faster than simon cowell  
in the 11 november 2007 episode 
retook his status as the holder of the fastest lap with a time of 1 45.90  according to clarkson  the cameramen said they had never seen such consistency in the practice laps  however  cowell was knocked off the top spot in series 11 by   who now holds the fastest time in the lacetti  although clarkson selected the fastest of jay kay s times rather than the last run  which was slower than cowell s time  seemingly due to a dislike of cowell  he claimed earlier in the episode that cowell had been at the top of the leaderboard for too long   had this not happened  cowell would have been knocked off the top by
host  
clarkson has referred to the part of the board with times of 1 51 and over as the   zone  due to the propensity for classically trained actors to post slow times 
series 11 featured a slight change to the format  with two  stars  per episode instead of the previous one  although there had been a couple of editions in previous series  with more than one guest   each of the pair are professionally associated with their fellow guest  usually both either act in or present the same tv show  unlike previous episodes where two stars have appeared  the stars drove individual laps without the other present in the car 
on 28 march 2010  richard hammond attended the demolition of the two 550ft chimneys at lafarge cement s northfleet works  on the first episode of series 15  it was shown that the lacetti was partially crushed by placing it in the path of one of the falling chimneys

f1 drivers  
all
drivers are put into their own list with regard to lap times because of their exceptional skill level  when
was pulled out from retirement to allow
to make a time  clarkson noted that the liana would be pulled out for use by formula 1 drivers in the future 
the original  black  stig and the first  white  stig have done laps around the track in the suzuki liana  both had their times removed from the leaderboard upon their departure 
the first stig was   who once test drove for the
team  and drove for the ill-fated
one team  the second stig was   in the first episode of series 13 the stig was  revealed  to be michael schumacher  although this was a joke in the vein of the rest of his appearance on the show 
on 6 july 2011 
managed to top the board with a time of 1 44.0  vettel s lap was the first time someone taking a  formula one drivers  line through the first corner was able to top the stig s time  as
took the tighter line  clarkson also mentioned on this episode that the current stig has yet to do a lap of the track in the liana  therefore there is currently no time on the board for the stig 
on 17 february 2013 
returned to do a dry lap and lowered the f1 drivers record by 1.1s to 1 42.9  this was in the wake of his move to mercedes amg for the 2013 season 
on 8 february 2015

  top gear  retrieved 16 june 2009  in order to qualify for the power laps board  a car must be road legal and be a car  for this reason the f1 car  0 59.0   aston martin dbr9  1 08.6  and sea harrier  0 31.2  do not appear 
 
      series 1  episode 3  3 november 2002    jeremy clarkson   we said you could only take a car on that track if it s road legal  
 
      series 1  episode 9  22 december 2002    richard hammond   we specify everything that goes on our board here has to be road legal  
 
      series 5  episode 8  19 december 2004    jeremy clarkson   the thing is though  this is only for cars with ashtrays and noses that you can get over the    uh  speed bumps  it s only for road cars  
      series 5  episode 9  26 december 2004    jeremy clarkson   you can use it on the road because    the test that we have for our power board   cause only road cars can go on this  is whether they can get over a speed bump  
 
      series 6  episode 6  3 july 2005    jeremy clarkson   you can t buy this car so it has no place on our board   james may   but he s right though  those are the rules  
 
      series 10  episode 5  11 november 2007  16 52 minutes in    you know the rules  james  if a car can t get over a sleeping policeman it can t go on that board  we ve always said that and look at the nose on this  i mean never mind a sleeping policeman  you d rip that off if you ran over  
      series 10  episode 9  9 december 2007    jeremy clarkson   now because this has a hydraulic lifting nose  which we can see here  it is able to get over speed bumps and that means it is a road car and that means it can go on our board  
 
      series 13  episode 2  28 june 2009    jeremy clarkson   we subsequently discovered he was doing that on slick tyres  now we have rules on this power board here  ok  you can t use slicks  so this time is coming off  
      series 16  episode 3  6 february 2011    jeremy clarkson   not the volvo obviously because this board is for production cars only  
      series 12  episode 4  23 november 2008    james may   i think it s too heavy to put in the really  really fast time  
      series 8  episode 8  14 may 2006    jeremy clarkson   after the accident  stig said he reckons this car would be 4 seconds faster than it was if it had a big wing on the back
