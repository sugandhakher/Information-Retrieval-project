pipeline transport is the transportation of goods or material through a   the latest data  in 2014  gives a total of slightly less than 2,175,000 miles  3,500,000km  of pipeline in 120 countries of the world  the united states had 65   russia had 8   and canada had 3   thus 75  of all pipeline was in three countries 
pipeline and gas journals worldwide survey figures indicate that 118,623 miles  190,905km  of pipelines are planned and under construction  of these  88,976 miles  143,193km  represent projects in the planning and design phase  29,647 miles  47,712km  reflect pipelines in various stages of construction  liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline  pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum

it is uncertain when the first
pipeline was built  credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed  with competing claims for
and the
company in the late 19th century  and the oil transport association  which first constructed a 2-inch  51mm  wrought iron pipeline over a 6-mile  9.7km  track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in   in the 1860s  pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil 
or
over land 
natural gas  and similar gaseous fuels  are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids  ngls   small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of 125 pounds per square inch  860kpa   can be shipped by rail  truck or pipeline  propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch  eg  propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  100 psi  give or take depending on temperature  and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than 125psi  860kpa  at retail stations  pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at 250psi  1,700kpa  
the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of ngl processing plants are located in oil fields or close by when a number of pipelines tie into each other from various relatively close fields  many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota  montana  manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field  allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers  eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane 
the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america  is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources  into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of 2012  supplying 16 percent of all the natural gas used in ontario 
major russian gas pipelines to europe in 2009
this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba  thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer  compared to shipping by   pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity  pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons  employment on completed pipelines represents only  1  of that of the trucking industry  
to avoid delays and us government regulation  many small  medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east  this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us  the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota  is   only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the canadaus border and  
and
are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines  in the fall of 2012  the us began exporting
to europe  known as lpg  as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america 
as more north american pipelines are built  even more exports of lng  propane  butane  and other natural gas products will occur on all three us coasts  to give insight  north dakota s oil production has grown to 5 times in late 2012 compared to what it was just 6 years ago creating thousands of good paying long term jobs    north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price but pipelines are cheaper  rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery 
enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west  line 9  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward  from a presently rated 250,000 barrels equivalent per day pipeline  it will be expanded to between one million to 1.3 million barrels per day  it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario  michigan  ohio  pennsylvania  quebec and new york by early 2014  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port 
although pipelines can be built under the sea  that process is economically and technically demanding  so the majority of oil at sea is transported by
ships 
the enbridge
is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota  the pipeline will be 24-30 inches in diameter  it will carry over 300,000 barrels of oil a day with a volatility of 32 
growth of market  
gas pipe in the dry region of antofagasta  chile 
the market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in 2008  after faltering in 2009  demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew  by 2012  almost 32,000 miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction 
construction and operation  
oil pipelines are made from
or
tubes with inner diameter typically from 4 to 48 inches  100 to 1,220mm   most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about 3 to 6 feet  0.91 to 1.83m   to protect pipes from     and   a variety of methods are used  these can include
 wood slats  
coating  rockshield    imported sand padding  and padding machines 
crude oil contains varying amounts of
and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline  often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using   the practice of using devices known as  pigs  to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline  the devices are also known as  scrapers  or  go-devils    smart pigs   also known as  intelligent  or  intelligence  pigs  are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents  metal loss caused by corrosion  cracking or other mechanical damage  these devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station down-stream  either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line 
for natural gas  pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from 2 to 60 inches  51 to 1,524mm  in diameter  depending on the type of pipeline  the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a
where required by a regulating authority 
ammonia  
the world s longest ammonia pipeline from
to  
highly toxic
is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelines    however  incidents on ammonia-transporting lines are uncommon - unlike on industrial ammonia-processing equipment    a major ammonia pipeline is the
transammiak line connecting the
facility in
to the exporting -port of  
alcohol fuels

pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil  and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states  the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines  which are not problems with oil and natural gas  insufficient volumes and cost-effectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines 
coal and ore  
are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines  the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline  at the far end  the material must be dried  one example is a 525-kilometre  326mi  slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the
mine  producing 26.5 million tonnes per year  to the
in   an existing example is the 85-kilometre  53mi  savage river slurry pipeline in     possibly the world s first when it was built in 1967  it includes a 366-metre  1,201ft  bridge span at 167 metres  548ft  above the savage river

to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed
to push the water along until it reached its destination  hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere  and along with
were considered the lifeline of the roman empire  the
also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works  the famous
court
 d  189ad  once ordered the
bi lan to construct a series of square-pallet
outside the capital city of   these chain pumps serviced the imperial
and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a
system

main article 
district heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of
feed and return pipes which transport heated water 
or sometimes
to the customer  while steam is hottest and may be used in
due to its higher temperature  it is less
to produce and transport due to greater heat losses  heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons  the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10   as seen in norway s district heating network 
district heating pipelines are normally installed underground  with some exceptions  within the system 
may be installed to even out peak load demands  heat is transferred into the
of the dwellings through

between 1978 and 1994  a 15km milk pipeline ran between the
island of
and
on the mainland  of which 8km beneath the   every day  30.000 litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland  in 1994  the milk transport was abandoned 
marine pipelines  
main article 
in places  a pipeline may have to cross water expanses  such as small seas  straits and rivers  in many instances  they lie entirely on the seabed  these pipelines are referred to as  marine  pipelines  also   submarine  or  offshore  pipelines   they are used primarily to carry oil or gas  but transportation of water is also important  in offshore projects  a distinction is made between a  flowline  and a pipeline  the former is an intrafield pipeline  in the sense that it is used to connect subsea   manifolds and the
within a particular development field  the latter  sometimes referred to as an  export pipeline   is used to bring the resource to shore  the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland  mainly because of wave and current dynamics  along with other  
functions  
in general  pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose 
gathering pipelines
group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility  in this group  pipelines are usually short- a couple hundred metres- and with small diameters  sub-sea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems 
transportation pipelines
mainly long pipes with large diameters  moving products  oil  gas  refined products  between cities  countries and even continents  these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multi-products pipelines 
distribution pipelines
composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters  used to take the products to the final consumer  feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream  pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups 
development and planning  
when a pipeline is built  the construction project not only covers the
work to lay the pipeline and build the pump compressor stations  it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation 
the pipeline is routed along what is known as a  right of way   pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages 
open season to determine market interest  potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipeline s capacity rights  this stage lasts up to two months  if interest in the pipeline is limited  the project does not move forward 
route  right of way  selection
pipeline design  the pipeline project may take a number of forms  including the construction of a new pipeline  conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another  or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route  the design process may take up to six months 
obtaining approval  once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity  the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies  the process can last up to 18 months  particularly for pipelines that span multiple states 
surveying the route
clearing the route
trenching - main route and crossings  roads  rail  other pipes  etc  
installing the pipe
installing valves  intersections  etc 
covering the pipe and trench
testing  once construction is completed  the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity  these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing 
russia has  pipeline troops  as part of the   who are trained to build and repair pipelines  russia is the only country to have pipeline troops 
operation  
field devices are instrumentation  data gathering units and communication systems  the field
includes flow  pressure and temperature gauges transmitters  and other devices to measure the relevant data required  these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations  such as injection or delivery stations  pump stations  liquid pipelines  or compressor stations  gas pipelines   and block valve stations 
the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local
 rtu  that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems  such as satellite channels  microwave links  or cellular phone connections 
pipelines are controlled and operated remotely  from what is usually known as the  main control room   in this center  all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database  the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline  it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline 
the scada system for pipelines 
the
system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or   showing the operational conditions of the pipeline  the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line  as well as send operational commands  open close valves  turn on off compressors or pumps  change setpoints  etc   through the scada system to the field 
to optimize and secure the operation of these assets  some pipeline companies are using what is called  advanced pipeline applications   which are software tools installed on top of the scada system  that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection  leak location  batch tracking  liquid lines   pig tracking  composition tracking  predictive modeling  look ahead modeling  and operator training 
technology  
components  
the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the
and over ridge of the
pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location  the main elements of a pipeline system are 
initial injection station
known also as  supply  or  inlet  station  is the beginning of the system  where the product is injected into the line  storage facilities  pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations 
compressor pump stations
for liquid pipelines and
for gas pipelines  are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline  the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain  the type of product being transported  or operational conditions of the network 
partial delivery station
known also as  intermediate stations   these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported 
block valve station
these are the first line of protection for pipelines  with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak  block valve stations are usually located every 20 to 30 miles  48km   depending on the type of pipeline  even though it is not a design rule  it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines  the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported  the trajectory of the pipeline and or the operational conditions of the line 
regulator station
this is a special type of valve station  where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line  regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak 
final delivery station
known also as  outlet  stations or terminals  this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer  it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines 
leak detection systems  
since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country  it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets  and the population and environment where these pipelines run 
pipeline companies face government regulation  environmental constraints and social situations  government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation  operator training requirements  pipeline facilities  technology and applications required to ensure operational safety  for example  in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less  social factors also affect the operation of pipelines  product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies  in this case  the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow  with a high expectation for location accuracy 
various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines  from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance  the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm  cpm takes information from the field related to pressures  flows  and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported  once the estimation is completed  the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation  which may be related to a leak 
the
has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines  the api publications are 
ram 1130  computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines
api 1155  evaluation methodology for software based leak detection systems
api 1149  pipeline variable uncertainties   their effects on leak detectability
where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway  it is usually enclosed in a protective casing  this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances  and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks  the casing vent  a pipe protruding from the ground  often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker 
implementation  
as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases underground    however  in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a   pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead  pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as trans-alaska-pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground 
maintenance  
maintenance of pipelines includes checking
levels for the proper range  surveillance for construction  erosion  or leaks by foot  land vehicle  boat  or air  and running cleaning pigs  when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive 
us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in  cfr  sections  49 cfr 192 for natural gas pipelines  and 49 cfr 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines 
regulation  
an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park
in the us  onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the
 phmsa   certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the
 mms   in canada  pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or  if they cross provincial boundaries or the canadaus border  by the
 neb   government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from   often  the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline
in conjunction with
and technology to monitor the pipeline  above ground  cathodic protection is not an option  the coating is the only external protection 
pipelines and geopolitics  
pipelines for major energy resources  petroleum and natural gas  are not merely an element of trade  they connect to issues of
and
as well  and the construction  placement  and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in
interests and actions  a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009  wherein
between
and
ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis  russian state-owned gas company
cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through  in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine  russian gas flowing through ukrainewhich included nearly all supplies to
and some supplies to
and was cut off  creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel  russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers  and particularly the   from interfering in its    
oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of
and the  
hazard identification  
because the
fraction of
typically comprises
like
and   reasonably rapid carrier
can be expected to follow an above-ground spillostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a
residue that is slow to migrate  effective protocols to minimize exposure to
vapours are well-established  and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the
unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier  e g  a series of torrential downpours  
the keystone xl extension is designed to be buried under four feet of soil  which will hinder post-spill vaporization of the carrier fraction  diluent and bitumen will migrate at different rates  depending on the temperature- and composition of the surrounding soils  but separation will take place more slowly as the aromatics diffuse through sediment rather than through air 
the introduction of
and other volatile organic compounds  collectively   to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak  particularly if followed by rain  a pipeline breach would result in btex
and
of benzene in water  followed by
of the admixture into the aquifer  benzene can cause many
and is
with epa
 mcl  set at 5 g l for   although it is not well studied  single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis  additionally  the exposure of livestock  mainly cattle  to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues  such as   fetal damage and fatal poisoning 
the entire surface of an above-ground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach  pooled petroleum is unambiguous  readily spotted  and indicates the location of required repairs  because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment  gaps between   and data that requires interpretation  small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected
pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks  buried pipes draw fewer complaints  they are
from extremes in
temperature  they are shielded from   and they are less exposed to   buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris          and   they are protected from nesting birds 
mammals  and wayward buckshot  buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage  e g    and less accessible to     and  
exposure  
previous work has shown that a  worst-case exposure scenario  can be limited to a specific set of conditions  based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off
developed by transcanada  the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely  detection  shutoff  and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene  therefore  the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the
and go unnoticed for extended periods of time  leak detection is monitored through a
system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds  a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system   1.5  flow  could accumulate into a substantive spill  detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or
inspection  aerial surveying  or mass-balance inconsistencies  it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day inspection interval  however snow cover and location  e g  remote  deep  could delay detection  benzene typically makes up 0.1  1.0  of oil and will have varying degrees of
and dissolution based on environmental factors 
even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits  sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions  or other problems  the
line 6b
in
on july 25  2010 was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the
in that pipeline  the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed 17 hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan 
spill frequency-volume  
although the
 phmsa  has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills  transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design  operation  and safety  whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in spill estimates  given that the pipeline crosses 247 miles of the ogallala aquifer  or 14.5  of the entire pipeline length  and the 50-year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between 11  91 spills  approximately 1.6  13.2 spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer  an estimate of 13.2 spills over the aquifer  each lasting 14 days  results in 184 days of potential exposure over the 50 year lifetime of the pipeline  in the reduced scope worst case exposure scenario  the volume of a pinhole leak at 1.5  of max flow-rate for 14 days has been estimated at 189,000 barrels or 7.9 million gallons of oil  according to phmsas incident database  only 0.5  of all spills in the last 10 years were  10,000 barrels 
benzene fate and transport  
scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater
benzene is considered a light
with high solubility and high volatility    it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene  so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  1  weight by volume  would not volatilize before equilibrating with water  using the octanol-water partition coefficient and a 100-year precipitation event for the area  a worst-case estimate of 75mg l of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer  the actual movement of the
through
systems is not well described  although one estimate is that up to 4.9 billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl  the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize 
previous dilbit spill remediation difficulties  
one of the major concerns about
is the difficulty in cleaning it up  enbridge s line 6b  a 30-inch crude oil pipeline  ruptured in marshall  michigan on july 25  2010  mentioned above  spilled at least 843,000 gallons of dilbit  after detection of the leak  booms and vacuum trucks were deployed  heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams  and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill was contained  remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the kalamazoo river system  however  oil was still being found in affected waters in october 2012 
dangers  
accidents  
for a more comprehensive list  see  
pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material  such as natural gas or oil  pose special safety concerns 
1965 - a 32-inch gas transmission pipeline  north of natchitoches  louisiana  belonging to the tennessee gas pipeline exploded and burned from
