global public support for different energy sources  2011  based on a poll by

in 2014 renewables such as      
and burnt waste provided 19  of the total world final energy consumption  roughly half of it traditional use of biomass  the most important sector electricity with a renewable share of 22.8   most of it coming from water power with a share of 16.6   followed by wind with 3.1   several places run their grids almost exclusively on renewable energy  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply  also  professors s  pacala and

today with a wind  solar  water system should be similar to today s energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies  the main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will 
similarly  in the united states  the independent
has noted that sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change    and the escalation of energy costs  renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states  taken collectively  can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand  
the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political rather than technological  according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report  which reviewed many international studies  the key roadblocks are    the   political inaction  unsustainable energy consumption  outdated energy infrastructure  and financial constraints

history  
using 100  renewable energy was first suggested in a
paper published in 1975 by danish physicist   which was followed by several other proposals  in 1976
analyst
coined the term    to describe an alternative future where
and appropriate
sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels 
in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published  these were followed by the first detailed 100  scenarios  in 2006 a phd thesis was published by czisch in which it was shown that in a 100  renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in europa and north africa  in the same year danish energy professor
published a first paper in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables  which was followed by several other papers on the
to 100  renewable energy in denmark  since then lund has been publishing several papers on 100  renewable energy  after 2009 publications began to rise steeply  covering 100  scenarios for countries in europa  america  australia and other parts of the world 
even in the early 2000s it was extraordinary for scientists and decision-makers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity  however  renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then 
modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price  current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation  on-shore
is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions 
power  cst  with
has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent 
renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated 
generate 39 percent of danish electricity  and denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well  together  wind and biomass provide 44  of the electricity consumed by the country s six million inhabitants  in 2010  portugals 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources  spains 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables 
renewable energy has a history of strong public support  in america  for example  a 2013
showed that two in three americans want the u s  to increase domestic energy production using solar power  76    wind power  71    and natural gas  65    far fewer want more petroleum production  46   and more nuclear power  37    least favored is coal  with about one in three americans favouring it 
says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this 
at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply  national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond  and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy  including a binding 20  by 2020 target for the european union  some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100  renewables  outside europe  a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 20202030 time frame that range from 10  to 50  
involves substantial accident risks  e g       and the unsolved problem of safe long-term   and
has rather limited safe storage potentials  these constraints have also led to an interest in 100  renewable energy  a well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade  evaluating scenarios for 100  renewable energy for various geographical areas  in recent years  more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources  the incentive to use 100  renewable energy is created by
and ecological as well as economic concerns  post  
the first country to propose 100  renewable energy was   in 1998  proposals have been made for japan in 2003  and for australia in 2011 
obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources  albania and paraguay 100  from hydroelectricity  iceland 72  hydro and 28  geothermal   norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources  97 percent from hydropower   iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet  australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity  the road map for the united states  commitment by denmark  and vision 2050 for europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100  renewable energy  later reduced to 2040 in 2011  zero carbon britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in britain by 2030 by transitioning to renewable energy  in 2015  hawaii enacted a law that the renewable portfolio standard shall be 100 percent by 2045  this is often confused with renewable energy  if electricity produced on the grid is 65 gwh from fossil fuel and 35 gwh from renewable energy and rooftop solar produces 80 gwh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 gwh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 gwh  then the rps is 115 percent 
it is estimated that the world will spend an extra  8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources  a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100  renewable energy  research that has been published in
suggests that converting the entire world to 100  renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable  but requires political support  it would require building many more
and solar power systems but wouldn t utilize   other changes involve use of
and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage 
recent developments  
is a german
released in 2010  it shows the vision of a global society  which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100  with renewable energies  showing a complete reconstruction of the economy  to reach this goal  in 2011 
wrote the book the energy imperative  100 percent renewable now  published by routledge 
is a book by amory lovins released in october 2011  by combining reduced energy use with
gains  lovins says that there will be a  5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy  this can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies  through market forces  led by business 
says the book is a  wise  detailed and comprehensive blueprint   the first paragraph of the preface says 
imagine fuel without fear  no climate change  no oil spills  dead coal miners  dirty air  devastated lands  lost wildlife  no energy poverty  no oil-fed wars  tyrannies  or terrorists  nothing to run out  nothing to cut off  nothing to worry about  just energy abundance  benign and affordable  for all  for ever 
the
has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand  in a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth  the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17  of total energy by 2030  and 27  by 2050  the highest forecast projected 43  supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77  by 2050 
in 2011  the
has said that
technologies  in its many forms  can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces 
the development of affordable  inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits  it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous  inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource  enhance sustainability  reduce pollution  lower the costs of mitigating climate change  and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise  these advantages are global  hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments  they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared 
in 2011  the refereed journal
published two articles by   a professor of engineering at   and research scientist mark a  delucchi  about changing our energy supply mix and  providing all global energy with wind  water  and solar power   the articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power  transportation  and heating cooling from wind  water  and sunlight  wws   which are safe clean options  in part i  jacobson and delucchi discuss wws energy system characteristics  aspects of energy demand  wws resource availability  wws devices needed  and material requirements  they estimate that 3,800,000 5 mw   5350 100 mw
plants  and 270 new 1300 mw
plants will be required  in terms of   an additional 49,000 300 mw
plants  40,000 300 mw
power plants  and 1.7 billion 3kw rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed  such an extensive wws infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30   in part ii  jacobson and delucchi address variability of supply  system economics  and energy policy initiatives associated with a wws system  the authors advocate producing all new energy with wws by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050  barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be  primarily social and political  not technological or economic   energy costs with a wws system should be similar to today s energy costs 
in general  jacobson has said wind  water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world s energy  eliminating all   he advocates a  smart mix  of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand 
because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind  combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand  especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps 
a 2012 study by the
for a 72 gw system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective  for the   would use 17 gw of solar  68 gw of   and 115 gw of onshore wind  although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided  0.1  of the time would require generation from other sources 
in march 2012  denmark s parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity  heat and fuels from renewables by 2050  irenec is an annual conference on 100  renewable energy started in 2011 by
turkey  the 2013 conference was in istanbul 
more recently  jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100  renewable energy produced by wind  water and sunlight  for new york  california and washington states  by 2050  as of 2014  a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up  which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states  the 50-state plan is part of   an independent outreach effort led by jacobson  actor   and film director  
as of 2014  many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing  can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind  solar  biomass  biofuel  hydro  ocean and geothermal energy  debate over detailed plans remain  but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable  economically feasible  socially viable  and so realisable  this prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by germany  one of the world s most successful industrial economies  to undertake a major    
in 2015 a study was published in
that describes a pathway to 100  renewable energy in the united states by 2050 without using biomass  implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable  as by 2050 it would save about  600 billion dollars
a year due to reduced
and  3.3 trillion global warming costs  this would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around  8300 compared to a business as usual pathway  according to that study  barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political  as most people didn t know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs

had reduced electricity demand  france and sweden have low carbon intensity  since they predominately use a mixture of nuclear power and hydroelectricity 
although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy  it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases  as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification  for example 
achieve much better
than fossil fuel cars  and another example is
such as in the case of denmark which is proposing to move to greater use of heat pumps for heating buildings which provide multiple kilowatts of heat per kilowatt of electricity 
obstacles  
the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies  at the pace required to prevent   are primarily political and not technological  according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report  which reviewed many international studies  the key roadblocks are 
political paralysis
unsustainable consumption of energy and resources
path dependencies and outdated infrastructure
financial and governance constraints
climate scientist
discusses the problem with rapid
and said that while it is conceivable in places such as new zealand and norway   suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the united states  china  india  or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the
and    in 2013  smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of jacobson and colleagues  and writing in an issue of spectrum prepared by the   he identified numerous points of concern  such as cost  intermittent power supply  growing   and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that  history and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed   smil and hansen are concerned about the
of solar and wind power  but many other scientists and engineers have analysed this situation and said that the
can cope   
founder and president of the   a nonprofit research organization based in washington  d c   says a rapid transition to 100  renewable energy is both possible and necessary  brown compares with the u s  entry into world war ii and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the us industry and economy  a quick transition to 100  renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by brown to follow an approach with similar urgency 
the
says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production  the issue of
applies to popular renewable technologies  mainly
and   and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned  the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system  as well as the demand side flexibility  variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when
is also available  but at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management  and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification  renewable electricity supply in the 20-50   penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems  albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system 
in 2011  the   the world s leading climate researchers selected by the united nations  said  as infrastructure and energy systems develop  in spite of the complexities  there are few  if any  fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied   ipcc scenarios  generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world   the ipcc said that if governments were supportive  and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed  renewable energy supply could account for almost 80  of the world s energy use within forty years    chairman of the ipcc  said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1  of global gdp annually  this approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million  the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible 
in november 2014 the intergovernmental panel on climate change came out with their   saying that in the absence of any one technology  such as bioenergy  carbon dioxide capture and storage  nuclear  wind and solar   climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent  for example  it may cost 40  more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture   table 3.2
