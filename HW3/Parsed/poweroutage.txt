there are many causes of power failures in an electricity network  examples of these causes include faults at   damage to  
or other parts of the
system  a   or the overloading of electricity mains 
power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk  institutions such as  
plants    shelters and the like will usually have backup power sources such as   which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost  other critical systems  such as   are also required to have emergency power  the
of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of
for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage

types of power outage  
blackout
transient fault
power outages are categorized into three different phenomena  relating to the duration and effect of the outage 
a
is a massive loss of power typically caused by a fault on a power line  power is automatically restored once the fault is cleared 
a
is a drop in
in an electrical power supply  the term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags  brownouts can cause poor performance of equipment or even incorrect operation 
a blackout is the total loss of power to an area and is the most severe form of power outage that can occur  blackouts which result from or result in
tripping are particularly difficult to recover from quickly  outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks depending on the nature of the blackout and the configuration of the electrical network 
protecting the power system from outages  
tree limbs creating a short circuit in electrical lines during a storm  this typically results in a power outage in the area supplied by these lines
in   the power generation and the electrical load  demand  must be very close to equal every second to avoid overloading of network components  which can severely damage them 
and
are used to automatically detect overloads and to disconnect circuits at risk of damage 
under certain conditions  a network component shutting down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring segments of the network leading to a
of a larger section of the network  this may range from a building  to a block  to an entire city  to an entire  
modern power systems are designed to be resistant to this sort of cascading failure  but it may be unavoidable  see below   moreover  since there is no short-term economic benefit to preventing rare large-scale failures  researchers have expressed concern that there is a tendency to erode the resilience of the network over time  which is only corrected after a major failure occurs  in a 2003 publication  carreras and co-authors claimed that reducing the likelihood of small outages only increases the likelihood of larger ones  in that case  the short-term economic benefit of keeping the individual customer happy increases the likelihood of large-scale blackouts 
protecting computer systems from power outages  
computer systems and other electronic devices containing logic circuitry are susceptible to data loss or hardware damage that can be caused by the sudden loss of power  these can include data networking equipment  video projectors  alarm systems as well as computers  to protect against this  the use of an
or ups can provide a constant flow of electricity if a primary power supply becomes unavailable for a short period of time  to protect against surges  events where voltages increase for a few seconds   which can damage hardware when power is restored  a special device called a
that absorbs the excess voltage can be used 
restoring power after a wide-area outage  
restoring power after a wide-area outage can be difficult  as power stations need to be brought back on-line  normally  this is done with the help of power from the rest of the grid  in the total absence of grid power  a so-called
needs to be performed to
the power grid into operation  the means of doing so will depend greatly on local circumstances and operational policies  but typically
utilities will establish localized  power islands  which are then progressively coupled together  to maintain supply frequencies within tolerable limits during this process  demand must be reconnected at the same pace that generation is restored  requiring close coordination between power stations  transmission and distribution organizations 
blackout inevitability and electric sustainability  
self-organized criticality  
it has been argued on the basis of
and computer modeling that
are   these systems exhibit unavoidable disturbances of all sizes  up to the size of the entire system  this phenomenon has been attributed to steadily increasing demand load  the economics of running a power company  and the limits of modern engineering  while blackout frequency has been shown to be reduced by operating it further from its critical point  it generally isnt economically feasible  causing providers to increase the average load over time or upgrade less often resulting in the grid moving itself closer to its critical point  conversely  a system past the critical point will experience too many blackouts leading to system-wide upgrades moving it back below the critical point  the term critical point of the system is used here in the sense of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics  representing the point where a system undergoes a phase transition  in this case the transition from a steady reliable grid with few cascading failures to a very sporadic unreliable grid with common cascading failures  near the critical point the relationship between blackout frequency and size follows a   other leaders are dismissive of system theories that conclude that blackouts are inevitable  but do agree that the basic operation of the grid must be changed  the
champions the use of
features such as power control devices employing
to coordinate the grid  others advocate greater use of electronically controlled
 hvdc  firebreaks to prevent disturbances from cascading across ac lines in a  
becomes much more common close to this critical point  the power law relationship is seen in both historical data and model systems  the practice of operating these systems much closer to their maximum capacity leads to magnified effects of random  unavoidable disturbances due to aging  weather  human interaction etc  while near the critical point  these failures have a greater effect on the surrounding components due to individual components carrying a larger load  this results in the larger load from the failing component having to be redistributed in larger quantities across the system  making it more likely for additional components not directly affected by the disturbance to fail  igniting costly and dangerous cascading failures  these initial disturbances causing blackouts are all the more unexpected and unavoidable due to actions of the power suppliers to prevent obvious disturbances  cutting back trees  separating lines in windy areas  replacing aging components etc    the complexity of most power grids often makes the initial cause of a blackout extremely hard to identify

opa model  
in 2002  researchers at
 ornl   power system engineering research center of
 pserc   and
proposed a mathematical model for the behavior of electrical distribution systems  this model has become known as the opa model  a reference to the names of the authors  institutions  opa is a cascading failure model  other cascading failure models include manchester  hidden failure  cascade  and branching 
mitigation of power outage frequency  
the effects of trying to mitigate cascading failures near the critical point in an economically feasible fashion are often shown to not be beneficial and often even detrimental  four mitigation methods have been tested using the opa blackout model 
increase critical number of failures causing cascading blackouts  shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts 
increase individual power line max load  shown to increase the frequency of smaller blackouts and decrease that of larger blackouts 
combination of increasing critical number and max load of lines  shown to have no significant effect on either size of blackout  the resulting minor reduction in the frequency of blackouts is projected to not be worth the cost of the implementation 
increase the excess power available to the grid  shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts 
in addition to the finding of each mitigation strategy having a cost-benefit relationship with regards to frequency of small and large blackouts  the total number of blackout events was not significantly reduced by any of the above-mentioned mitigation measures 
a complex network-based model to control large
 blackouts  using local information only was proposed by a  e  motter
