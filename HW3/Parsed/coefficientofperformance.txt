the coefficient of performance or cop  sometimes cp  of a
is a ratio of heating or cooling provided to work required  higher cops equate to lower operating costs  the cop may exceed 1  because  instead of just converting work to heat  which  if 100  efficient  would be a cop of 1   it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required  for complete systems  cop should include energy consumption of all auxiliaries  cop is highly dependent on operating conditions  especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system  and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions

the equation is

  displaystyle cop   frac  q  w   
where
q
  displaystyle q   
is the
supplied by the reservoir 
w
  displaystyle w   
is the
supplied to the heat pump 
the cop for heating and cooling are thus different  because the heat reservoir of interest is different  when one is interested in how well a machine cools  the cop is the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir to input work  however  for heating  the cop is the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir plus the input work to the input work

note that the cop of a heat pump depends on its duty  the heat rejected to the hot sink is greater than the heat absorbed from the cold source  so the heating cop is 1 greater than the cooling cop

applies to air conditioners or refrigerators  for heat engines  see   values for actual systems will always be less than these theoretical maximums  in europe  the standard tests for ground source heat pump units use 35c  95f  for

  according to the above formula  the maximum achievable cop would be 8.8  test results of the best systems are around 4.5  when measuring installed units over a whole season and accounting for the energy needed to pump water through the piping systems  seasonal cop s are around 3.5 or less  this indicates room for improvement

as the formula shows  the cop of a heat pump system can be improved by reducing the temperature gap

at which the system works  for a heating system this would mean two things  1  reducing the output temperature to around 30c  86f  which requires piped floor  wall or ceiling heating  or oversized water to air heaters and 2  increasing the input temperature  e g  by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank
   accurately determining thermal conductivity will allow for much more precise ground loop
or borehole sizing  resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system  for an air cooler  cop could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air  and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow  for both systems  also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps  and ventilators  by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the re number and hence the turbulence  and noise  and the head loss  see    the heat pump itself can be improved by increasing the size of the internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the
 and the price  relative to the power of the compressor  and also by reducing the system s internal temperature gap over the compressor  obviously  this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing hot tap water

consuming 1kwh would remove 2kwh of heat from a building s air  
given the same energy source and operating conditions  a higher cop heat pump will consume less purchased energy than one with a lower cop  the overall environmental impact of a heating or air conditioning installation depends on the source of energy used as well as the cop of the equipment  the operating cost to the consumer depends on the cost of energy as well as the cop or efficiency of the unit  some areas provide two or more sources of energy  for example  natural gas and electricity  a high cop of a heat pump may not entirely overcome a relatively high cost for electricity compared with the same heating value from natural gas 
for example  the 2009 us average price per therm  100,000 btu  of electricity was  3.38 while the average price per therm of natural gas was  1.16  using these prices  a heat pump with a cop of 3.5 in moderate climate would cost  0.97 to provide one therm of heat  while a high efficiency gas furnace with 95  efficiency would cost  1.22 to provide one therm of heat  with these average prices  the heat pump costs 20  less to provide the same amount of heat  at 0f  -18c  cop is much lower  then  the same system costs as much to operate as an efficient gas heater  the yearly savings will depend on the actual cost of electricity and natural gas  which can both vary widely 
however  a cop may help make a determination of system choice based on carbon contribution  although a heat pump may cost more to operate than a conventional natural gas or electric heater  depending on the source of
in one s area  it may contribute less net
to the atmosphere than burning natural gas or heating fuel  if locally no green electricity is available  then carbon-wise the best option would be to drive a heat pump on piped gas or oil  to store excess heat in the ground source for use in winter  while using the same machine also for producing electricity with a built-in

while the cop is partly a measure of the efficiency of a heat pump  it is also a measure of the conditions under which it is operating  the cop of a given heat pump will rise as the input temperature increases or the output temperature decreases because it is linked to a warm temperature distribution system like  
seasonal efficiency  
a realistic indication of energy efficiency over an entire year can be archived by using seasonal cop or seasonal coefficient of performance  scop  for heat 
is mostly used for air conditioning  scop is a new methodology that gives a better indication of expected real-life performance  using cop can be considered using the  old  scale  seasonal efficiency gives an indication on how efficient a heat pump operates over an entire cooling or heating season
