etymology and terminology  
is a
word meaning  first    original   or  superior   according to toyota  the name was chosen because the prius was launched before environmental awareness became a mainstream social issue 
in february 2011  toyota asked the public to decide on what the most proper
form of prius should be  with choices including prien  prii  prium  prius  or priuses  the company said it would  use the most popular choice in its advertising  and on 20 february announced that  prii  was the most popular choice  and the new official plural designation  in latin prius is the neuter singular of the comparative form  prior  prior  prius  of an adjective with only comparative and superlative  the superlative being primus  prima  primum   consequently  like all third declension words  the plural in latin was priora  cf    which was used by the
in 2007 
despite the  official  plural form used by toyota   priuses  remains good english  and is the more frequently used plural form 
beginning in september 2011  toyota usa began using the following names to differentiate the original prius from some newer members of the prius family  the standard prius became the prius liftback  the
 known as the prius  in japan  and prius   in europe   the   and the
 called toyota aqua in japan

in the united states  the nhw11 was the first prius to be sold  the prius was marketed between the smaller
and the larger   the published retail price of the car was us 19,995  the nhw11 prius became more powerful partly to satisfy the higher speeds and longer distances that americans drive  air conditioning and
were standard equipment  the vehicle was the second mass-produced hybrid on the american market  after the two-seat   while the larger prius could seat five  its battery pack restricted cargo space  the prius was offered in us in three trim packages  standard  base and touring

presented at the 2003   for the 2004 us model year  the prius was completely redesigned  it became a mid-size liftback  sized between the
and the   with redistributed mechanical and interior space significantly increasing rear-seat legroom and luggage room  the new prius is even more environmentally friendly than the previous model  according to the epa   and is 6 inches  150mm  longer than the previous version  its more aerodynamic
body balances length and wind resistance  resulting in a drag coefficient of 0.26  the development effort  led by chief engineer   led to 530 patents for the vehicle 
production commenced in august 2003 at the tsutsumi plant in   supplemented in october 2004 with the fujimatsu plant at  
the prius uses an all-electric a c compressor for cooling  an industry first  combined with a smaller and lighter
battery  the xw20 is more powerful and more efficient than the xw10  in the us  the battery pack of 2004 and later models is warranted for 150,000 miles  240,000km  or 10 years in states that have adopted the stricter   and 100,000 miles  160,000km  or 8 years elsewhere  the warranty for hybrid components is 100,000 miles  160,000km  or 8 years

toyota debuted the new prius  2010 us model year  at the january 2009   and sales began in japan on 18 may 2009  toyota cut the price of the prius from 2.331 million to 2.05 million to better compete with the   leading some to wonder whether increased sales of the prius might come at the expense of sales of other vehicles with higher margins  competition from lower priced hybrids  such as the honda insight  also made it difficult for toyota to capitalize on the prius s success  as of june 2013  toyota has sold about 1,688,000 third-generation priuses worldwide 
at its introduction in 2009  it won the
award for the second time 
its new body design is more aerodynamic  with a reduced drag coefficient of 0.25  this figure is disputed by
which found the value for the model with 17-inch wheels to be around 0.30 based on tests in gm  ford  and chrysler wind tunnels  car   driver measured the third generation prius at 0.26 in a privately arranged five-way wind-tunnel test of comparable cars  an underbody rear fin helps stabilize the vehicle at higher speeds  the roof has a special design of a double wave to keep down the air resistancebut this design is not present on the solar roof model   
the estimated fuel-efficiency rating  using the us epa combined cycle  is 50mpg-us  4.7l 100km  60mpg-imp   the prius was the most efficient car powered by liquid fuel available in the us in 2009  based on the official rating  only the first-generation
 20002006  equipped with a manual transmission attained a lower fuel consumption rate  the official uk fuel efficiency data for the prius t3 is urban 72.4mpg-imp  3.90l 100km  60.3mpg-us   extra urban 76.4mpg-imp  3.70l 100km  63.6mpg-us   combined 72.4mpg-imp  3.90l 100km  60.3mpg-us  
the 1.8-liter gasoline engine  previously 1.5 liters  generates 98hp  73kw   and with the added power of the electric motor generates a total of 134hp  100kw   previously 110hp or 82kw   the larger engine displacement allows for increased torque  reducing engine speeds     which improves fuel economy at highway speeds  thanks to its electric water pump  the prius engine is the first consumer automotive production engine that requires no accessory belts  which also further improves its fuel economy  the electric motors and other components of the hybrid powertrain are also smaller and more efficient than the industry average  toyota estimates the new inverter  motor and transaxle are 20 percent lighter 
2009 toyota prius i-tech liftback  australia 
in constructing the prius  toyota used a new range of plant-derived ecological   made out of cellulose derived from wood or grass instead of petroleum  the two principal crops used are
and   kenaf is a member of the   a relative to cotton and okra  ramie  commonly known as china grass  is a member of the
and one of the strongest natural fibres  with a density and absorbency comparable to flax  toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the united nations  international year of natural fibres  which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others 
2011 facelift
to create the third-generation prius for 2010  toyota engineers revisited just about everything to eke out further efficiencies  a new front-drive platform underpinned the car  although the wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre  weight-saving aluminum was employed in the hood  rear hatch  front axle and brake calipers  disc brakes were finally assigned to all four wheels  
in december 2013 
named the prius as the  best value   for the second year in a row 
high trim levels in the third generation prius include features like softex trim seats  that look and feel just like leather but are lighter in weight   headlight washers  parking sensors  premium jbl speaker system and electrically operated lumbar support adjustment for the driver s seat 
in mid-2011  for the 2012    the third-generation prius liftback received modest style and equipment changes  the exterior changes include updated headlamps  revised tail lamps  plus a distinctive front fascia and bumper  and the deletion of the  super white  color option in the united states  prospective american prius buyers wanting a white exterior had to choose the  blizzard pearl  color  a metallic off-white  for an additional  220  or choose another make or model  the prius could be equipped with an updated
system featuring the optional
suite of connectivity features  other updates included a 6.1-inch touch-screen  an am fm cd player unit  a
for
connectivity  an auxiliary input jack  a
hands-free phone capability and streaming audio  the prius also included an optional
on the roof of the car  solely to power a ventilation fan while the car is parked  to keep the interior cooler in sunny conditions 
in the us market  only the prius two  three  four and five were offered  the premium prius five model s advanced technology package included the premium hdd navigation system  plus the    
and   the pre-collision system retracted the front seatbelts and applies the brakes in certain conditions when it determines that a crash is unavoidable  lane keep assist helped the driver stay within the lane  the us 2012 model year included toyota s
 vpns   which emitted an artificial engine noise to alert pedestrians  the blind  and others of the vehicle s presence due to significant noise reduction typical of a hybrid vehicle traveling at low speeds in

the fourth generation prius was first shown during september 2015 in las vegas  and was released for retail customers in japan in december 2015  the launch in north american market occurred in january 2016  and february in europe  toyota expected to sell 12,000 fourth generation prius cars a month in japan  and to reach annual sales between 300,000 and 350,000 units 
in august 2013  toyota managing officer satoshi ogiso  who was chief engineer for the prius line  announced some of the improvements and key features of the next generation prius  the next prius is the first vehicle to use the
 tnga  modular platform  which provides a lower
and increased structural rigidity  these features  along with other improvements allow for gains in ride-and-handling  agility and aerodynamics  the improved aerodynamics contribute to an all-new exterior design  which includes a roomier interior  ogiso also explained that the next-generation prius plug-in hybrid  the prius prime  was developed in parallel with the standard prius model 
the fourth generation prius has stirred controversy over the style and cohesion of its exterior design  with analysis from critics contending that the excessively angular headlamps and unnecessary creases in the bodywork has created a haphazard design  that falls into the trap of equating aggressiveness with sportiness 
the fourth-generation prius is designed to deliver significantly improved fuel economy in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost  these objectives were achieved through the development of a new generation of powertrains with significant advances in battery  electric motor and gasoline engine technologies  it features improved batteries with higher energy density  smaller electric motors  with higher power density than the previous prius motors  and the gasoline engine features a
greater than 40   that of the third-generation prius is 38.5    the prius fuel economy has improved on average by about 10  each generation  and toyota has set the challenge to continue to improve at this rate

in terms of fuel economy  the 2016 prius eco with a combined city highway fuel economy of 56mpg-us  4.2l 100km  67mpg-imp   passed the 2000

the toyota prius
is a   sometimes referred to as a combined hybrid 
the prius is a   sometimes referred to as a combined hybrid  a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline and or electric power  wind resistance is reduced by a
of 0.25  0.29 for 2000 model  with a
design to reduce air resistance  lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction  an electric water pump eliminates   in the us and canada  a
is used to store hot
when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time  the prius engine makes use of the  
ev mode  
when the vehicle is turned on with the  power  button  it is ready to drive immediately with the electric motor  in the second generation prius  electric pumps warm the engine by pumping previously saved hot engine coolant from a coolant thermos before the internal combustion engine is started  the delay between powering the car on and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds  the third generation prius does not have a coolant thermos  instead  the engine is heated by recapturing exhaust heat  a button labelled  ev  maintains electric vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than 25mph  40km h   this permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption for journeys under 1 mile  1.6km   the car automatically reverts to normal mode if the battery becomes exhausted  prior to the 2010 model  the north american model did not have the  ev  button  although the  ev  mode is still supported internally by the prius hybrid vehicle management computer   
batteries  
battery pack from the second generation prius
there are two principal battery packs  the high voltage  hv  battery  also known as the traction battery  and a 12 volt battery known as the low voltage  lv  battery  the traction battery is a
38-module
 nimh 
pack providing 273.6 volts  6.5 ah capacity and weighing 53.3kg  118lb  and is supplied by japan s   they are normally charged between 4060  of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as allow headroom for   each battery pack uses 1015kg  2233lb  of   and each prius electric motor contains 1kg  2lb  of   production of the car is described as  the biggest user of
of any object in the world   the lv battery is essential to starting the car  providing initial power to the computer 
the second generation prius contains a 1.310kwh battery  composed of 28 modules  each battery module is made of 6 individual 1.2v 6.5ah prismatic nimh cells in series forming a 7.2v 6.5ah module with 46wh kg energy density and 1,3kw kg output power density  each module contains an integrated charge controller and relay  these modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6v 6.5ah battery  traction battery   also known as the energy storage system  the computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38  and 82  state of charge  with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60   by shallow cycling the battery only a small portion of its net available energy storage capacity is available for use  approximately 400wh  by the hybrid drive system  but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life  thermal management control  and net long term calendar life of the battery  active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting  while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design 
battery life cycle  
as the prius reached ten years of being available in the us market  in february 2011
decided to look at the lifetime of the prius battery and the cost to replace it  the magazine tested a 2002 toyota prius with over 200,000 miles on it  and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 prius with 2,000 miles tested by consumer reports 10 years before  the comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration  overall
of the 2001 model was 40.6 miles per us gallon  5.79l 100km  48.8mpg-imp  while the 2002 prius with high mileage delivered 40.4 miles per us gallon  5.82l 100km  48.5mpg-imp   the magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run  the cost of replacing the first generation battery varies between us 2,200 and us 2,600 from a toyota dealer  but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around us 500  one study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries 
air conditioning  hvac   
the
system uses an ac
to drive a   using a scroll compressor increases the efficiency of the system  while driving it with an ac induction motor makes the system more flexible  so the
can run while the engine is off  because the oil used with the gas also flows in the area of the motor-windings  it needs to be highly insulating  therefore  a special oil  nd11  is used  the system cannot be maintained with equipment that is used to service regular cars  which mainly use
oils  as the equipment would contaminate the nd11 oil with pag oil  according to sae j2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1  pag when filling  1  pag oil may result in a resistance drop by a factor of about 10 
environmental impact  
fuel economy and emissions  
united states
since its inception  the toyota prius has been among the best fuel economy vehicles available in the united states  and for the
2012  the prius family has three models among the top 10 most fuel-efficient cars sold in the country as rated by
 epa   after the
was discontinued in september 2006  the prius liftback became the most fuel-efficient car sold in the american market  until it was topped by the
in december 2010  as the
was rated by epa with an overall combined city highway gasoline-electricity fuel economy of 60mpg-us  3.9l 100km  72mpg-imp 
 mpg-e   according to the epa  for the model year 2012  and when only gasoline-powered vehicles are considered  excluding    the prius c ranks as the most fuel-efficient   the prius liftback as the most fuel-efficient   and the prius v as the most fuel-efficient midsize  
more fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than a conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this

lifetime energy usage  
in 2008  the british government and british media requested that toyota release detailed figures for the energy use and co2 emissions resulting from the building and disposal of the prius  toyota has not supplied the requested data to address statements that the lifetime energy usage of the prius  including the increased environmental cost of manufacture and disposal of the nickel-metal hydride battery  is outweighed by lower lifetime fuel consumption  toyota states that lifetime co2 saving is 43 percent  as of 2010  the
operated over 100 priuses  the largest part of its fleet  and lists the prius as having the lowest co2 emissions among its fleet 
initially published a study in which they estimated that the total lifetime energy cost of a 2005 prius was greater than that of a   the study has been widely debunked  see for example   hummer versus prius   dust to dust  report misleads the media and public with bad science  
electromagnetic field levels  
prius cutaway model showing forward engine connected to rear high voltage battery
the prius uses electric motors in the hybrid propulsion systems  powered by a high voltage battery in the rear of the car  there has been some public concern over whether the levels of
exposure within the cabin are higher than comparable cars  and what health effects those fields may present  popularized by a 2008
article  however  toyota and several independent studies have indicated that aside from a brief spike when accelerating  the electromagnetic fields within the prius are no different from those of a conventional car and do not exceed the
exposure guidelines 
a 2013 study by the
found that patients with implanted cardiac devices such as
and
can safely drive or ride in hybrids or
without risk of
 emi   the research was conducted using implantable devices from the three major manufacturers and a 2012 toyota prius hybrid  the study used 30 participants with implanted devices  and measured electric and magnetic fields in six positions inside and outside the prius  and each position was evaluated at different speeds

the
reported in february 2007 on concerns that quiet cars like the prius may pose a safety risk to those who rely on engine noise to sense the presence or location of moving vehicles  blind pedestrians are a primary concern  and the
advocates audio emitters on hybrid vehicles  but it has been argued that increased risks may also affect sighted pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles  however  silent vehicles are already relatively common  and there is also a lack of aural cues from vehicles that have a conventional internal combustion engine where engine noise has been reduced by noise-absorbing materials in the engine bay and noise-canceling muffler systems  in july 2007  a spokesman for toyota said the company is aware of the issue and is studying options 
in 2010  toyota released a device for the third-generation prius meant to alert pedestrians of its proximity  japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in january 2010 and the us approved legislation on december 2010  models equipped with
include all 2012 and later
prius family vehicles that have been introduced in the united states  including the   the   the
and the   the warning sound is activated when the car is traveling at less than 15mph  24km h  and cannot be manually turned off 
marketing and culture  
co2 advertising  
in the uk  the   an independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry  ruled that a television advert for the toyota prius should not be broadcast again in the same form  having breached rules concerning misleading advertising  the advertisement stated that the prius  emits up to one tonne less co2 per year   while on-screen text included  1 tonne of co2 less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine  average calculated on 20,000 km a year   points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison  whether   up to  one tonne less  adequately communicated that reductions could be lower  and whether the distance used was appropriate  20,000km per year is around a us car s average annual driving distance  while a uk car s is 13,440km 
political symbolism  
prius fleet operated by the
the large number of prius-owning progressive celebrities in 2002 prompted the
to dub hybrids  hollywood s latest politically correct status symbol   conservatives called  prius patriots  also drive the cars because they want to contribute to reducing us dependence on foreign oil  a 2007
article said  prius progressives  were becoming an archetype  with american conservative commentator
opining that  these liberals think they re ahead of the game on these things  and they re just suckers  
in july 2007
published an article using data from cnw marketing research finding that 57  of prius buyers said their main reason for buying was that  it makes a statement about me   while just 37  cited fuel economy as a prime motivator  shortly afterwards washington post columnist
coined the term  prius politics  to describe a situation where the driver s desire to  show off  is a stronger motivator than the desire to curb
emissions  some conservatives promote use of the toyota prius and other hybrid cars  for example  jim road from what would jesus drive  encouraged people to drive hybrid cars because of the damage that large suvs and faster cars can do to others 
former
 cia  chief
drives a prius because of its low fuel consumption  woolsey noted the volatility of the middle east  coupled with anti-us sentiment in much of the region  noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the middle east gives vast profits to middle eastern regimes  woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles  in a motor trend magazine article  woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like   meaning that americans who buy inefficient vehicles would  in effect  be indirectly funding terrorism   we re paying for both sides in this war  and that s not a good long-term strategy   said woolsey   i have a bumper sticker on the back of my prius that reads   bin laden hates this car

there have been a number of governments with incentives intended to encourage hybrid car sales  in some countries  including the us and canada  some rebate incentives have been exhausted  while other countries such as the united kingdom  sweden  belgium  and the netherlands have various or alternative incentives to purchasing a hybrid vehicle 
several us companies offer employees incentives 
will reimburse us 3,000 on the purchase of new hybrid vehicles to full- and part-time associates working more than 20 hours per week    software company   and organic food and drink producer
offer employees a us 5,000 credit toward their purchase of certain hybrid vehicles including the prius  integrated archive systems  a palo alto it company  offers a us 10,000 subsidy toward the purchase of hybrid vehicles to full-time employees employed more than one year
