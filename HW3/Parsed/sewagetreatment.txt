wastewater treatment plant in   united states
sewage treatment is the process of removing
from   primarily from household   it includes physical  chemical  and biological processes to remove these contaminants and produce environmentally safe treated wastewater  or treated    a by-product of sewage treatment is usually a semi-solid waste or slurry  called   that has to undergo further
before being suitable for disposal or land application 
sewage treatment may also be referred to as   although the latter is a broader term which can also be applied to purely industrial wastewater  for most cities  the
will also carry a proportion of
to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pretreatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load  if the sewer system is a
then it will also carry
 stormwater  to the sewage treatment plant

terminology  
the term  sewage treatment plant   or  sewage treatment works  in some countries  is nowadays often replaced with the term   plant  
sewage can be treated close to where the sewage is created  which may be called a  decentralized  system or even an  on-site  system  in  
or    alternatively  sewage can be collected and transported by a network of pipes and pump stations to a municipal treatment plant  this is called a  centralized  system  see also
and    although the borders between decentralized and centralized can be variable  for this reason  the terms  semi-decentralized  and  semi-centralized  are also being used   
origins of sewage  
main article 
sewage is generated by residential  institutional  commercial and industrial establishments  it includes
liquid from         and
draining into   in many areas  sewage also includes liquid waste from industry and commerce  the separation and draining of household waste into
and
is becoming more common in the developed world  with treated greywater being permitted to be used for watering plants or recycled for flushing toilets 
sewage mixing with rainwater  
sewage may include
runoff or  
systems capable of handling storm water are known as
systems  this design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  119 combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than   heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system  causing a spill or overflow  sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers  and they are not designed to transport stormwater  backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive
 dilution by stormwater and or groundwater  is allowed into a sanitary sewer system  communities that have
in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage  sanitary sewers  and stormwater  because precipitation causes widely varying flows  reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency 
as rainfall travels over roofs and the ground  it may pick up various contaminants including
particles and other       animal waste  and
and   some
require stormwater to receive some level of treatment before being discharged directly into waterways  examples of treatment processes used for stormwater include     buried
with various kinds of   and
 to remove coarse solids  
industrial effluent  
main article 
in highly regulated developed countries 
usually receives at least pretreatment if not full treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load  before discharge to the sewer  this process is called   the same does not apply to many developing countries where industrial effluent is more likely to enter the sewer if it exists  or even the receiving water body  without pretreatment 
industrial wastewater may contain pollutants which cannot be removed by conventional sewage treatment  also  variable flow of industrial waste associated with production cycles may upset the population dynamics of biological treatment units  such as the  
process steps  
overview  
sewage collection and treatment is typically subject to local  state and federal regulations and standards 
treating wastewater has the aim to produce an
that will do as little harm as possible when discharged to the surrounding environment  thereby preventing
compared to releasing untreated wastewater into the environment 
sewage treatment generally involves three stages  called primary  secondary and tertiary treatment 
primary treatment consists of temporarily holding the sewage in a quiescent basin where heavy solids can settle to the bottom while oil  grease and lighter solids float to the surface  the settled and floating materials are removed and the remaining liquid may be discharged or subjected to secondary treatment  some sewage treatment plants that are connected to a combined sewer system have a bypass arrangement after the primary treatment unit  this means that during very heavy rainfall events  the secondary and tertiary treatment systems can be bypassed to protect them from hydraulic overloading  and the mixture of sewage and stormwater only receives primary treatment 
removes dissolved and suspended biological matter  secondary treatment is typically performed by   water-borne micro-organisms in a managed habitat  secondary treatment may require a separation process to remove the micro-organisms from the treated water prior to discharge or tertiary treatment 
tertiary treatment is sometimes defined as anything more than primary and secondary treatment in order to allow rejection into a highly sensitive or fragile ecosystem  estuaries  low-flow rivers  coral reefs       treated water is sometimes disinfected chemically or physically  for example  by lagoons and   prior to discharge into a      
or   or it can be used for the
of a golf course  green way or park  if it is sufficiently clean  it can also be used for
or agricultural purposes

pretreatment  
pretreatment removes all materials that can be easily collected from the raw sewage before they damage or clog the pumps and sewage lines of primary treatment   objects commonly removed during pretreatment include trash  tree limbs  leaves  branches  and other large objects 
the influent in sewage water passes through a
to remove all large objects like cans  rags  sticks  plastic packets etc  carried in the sewage stream  this is most commonly done with an automated mechanically raked bar screen in modern plants serving large populations  while in smaller or less modern plants  a manually cleaned screen may be used  the raking action of a mechanical bar screen is typically paced according to the accumulation on the bar screens and or flow rate  the solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill  or incinerated  bar screens or mesh screens of varying sizes may be used to optimize solids removal  if gross solids are not removed  they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant  and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process  9
grit removal  
pretreatment may include a sand or grit channel or chamber  where the velocity of the incoming sewage is adjusted to allow the settlement of sand  grit  stones  and broken glass  these particles are removed because they may damage pumps and other equipment  for small sanitary sewer systems  the grit chambers may not be necessary  but grit removal is desirable at larger plants  grit chambers come in 3 types  horizontal grit chambers  aerated grit chambers and vortex grit chambers  the process is called sedimentation 
flow equalization  
and mechanized secondary treatment are more efficient under uniform flow conditions 
may be used for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks  basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during plant maintenance and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment  including portable toilet waste  vehicle holding tanks  and septic tank pumpers   flow equalization basins require variable discharge control  typically include provisions for bypass and cleaning  and may also include aerators  cleaning may be easier if the basin is downstream of screening and grit removal 
fat and grease removal  
in some larger plants 
and
are removed by passing the sewage through a small tank where skimmers collect the fat floating on the surface  air blowers in the base of the tank may also be used to help recover the fat as a froth  many plants  however  use primary clarifiers with mechanical surface skimmers for fat and grease removal 
primary treatment  
primary treatment tanks in oregon  usa 
in the primary
stage  sewage flows through large tanks  commonly called  pre-settling basins    primary sedimentation tanks  or  primary    the tanks are used to settle sludge while grease and oils rise to the surface and are skimmed off  primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities  911 grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for
 soap making  
secondary treatment  
main article 
secondary treatment is designed to substantially degrade the biological content of the sewage which are derived from human waste  food waste  soaps and detergent  the majority of municipal plants treat the settled sewage liquor using aerobic biological processes  to be effective  the
require both
and food to live  the
and
consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants  e g    fats  organic short-chain
molecules  etc   and bind much of the less soluble fractions into   secondary treatment systems are classified as fixed-film or suspended-growth systems 
fixed-film or attached growth systems include   bio-towers  and   where the biomass grows on media and the sewage passes over its surface  1113 the fixed-film principle has further developed into moving bed biofilm reactors  mbbr  and integrated fixed-film activated sludge  ifas  processes  an mbbr system typically requires a smaller footprint than suspended-growth systems 
suspended-growth systems include   where the biomass is mixed with the sewage and can be operated in a smaller space than trickling filters that treat the same amount of water  however  fixed-film systems are more able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems  1113
secondary sedimentation

at a rural treatment plant 
some secondary treatment methods include a secondary clarifier to settle out and separate biological floc or filter material grown in the secondary treatment bioreactor 
list of process types  
to use less space  treat difficult waste  and intermittent flows  a number of designs of hybrid treatment plants have been produced  such plants often combine at least two stages of the three main treatment stages into one combined stage  in the uk  where a large number of wastewater treatment plants serve small populations  package plants are a viable alternative to building a large structure for each process stage  in the us  package plants are typically used in rural areas  highway rest stops and trailer parks 
tertiary treatment  
the purpose of tertiary treatment is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment  sea  river  lake  wet lands  ground  etc    more than one tertiary treatment process may be used at any treatment plant  if disinfection is practised  it is always the final process  it is also called  effluent polishing  
filtration  
removes much of the residual suspended matter  2223 filtration over   also called carbon adsorption  removes residual   19
lagoons or ponds  
a sewage treatment plant and lagoon in   united states 
lagoons or ponds provide settlement and further biological improvement through storage in large man-made ponds or lagoons  these lagoons are highly aerobic and colonization by native   especially reeds  is often encouraged  small filter feeding
such as
and species of
greatly assist in treatment by removing fine particulates 
biological nutrient removal  
biological nutrient removal  bnr  is regarded by some as a type of secondary treatment process  and by others as a tertiary  or  advanced   treatment process 
wastewater may contain high levels of the nutrients
and   excessive release to the environment can lead to a buildup of nutrients  called   which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds    and
 blue-green algae   this may cause an   a rapid growth in the population of algae  the algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die  the decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die  which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose  in addition to causing deoxygenation  some algal species produce toxins that contaminate
supplies  different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus 
nitrogen removal  
nitrogen is removed through the biological
of nitrogen from
to
    followed by   the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas  nitrogen gas is released to the atmosphere and thus removed from the water 
nitrification itself is a two-step aerobic process  each step facilitated by a different type of bacteria  the oxidation of ammonia  nh3  to nitrite  no2  is most often facilitated by nitrosomonas spp    nitroso  referring to the formation of a
functional group   nitrite oxidation to nitrate  no3   though traditionally believed to be facilitated by nitrobacter spp   nitro referring the formation of a    is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by nitrospira spp 
denitrification requires anoxic conditions to encourage the appropriate biological communities to form  it is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria  sand filters  lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen  but the activated sludge process  if designed well  can do the job the most easily  1718 since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen  molecular nitrogen  gas  an
is needed  this can be  depending on the waste water  organic matter  from feces     or an added donor like   the sludge in the anoxic tanks  denitrification tanks  must be mixed well  mixture of recirculated mixed liquor  return activated sludge  ras   and raw influent  e g  by using
in order to achieve the desired denitrification 
sometimes the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrate alone is referred to as tertiary treatment 
over time  different treatment configurations have evolved as denitrification has become more sophisticated  an initial scheme  the ludzack-ettinger process  placed an anoxic treatment zone before the aeration tank and clarifier  using the return activated sludge  ras  from the clarifier as a nitrate source  influent wastewater  either raw or as effluent from primary clarification  serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon  using the inorganic nitrate as a source of oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen  this denitrification scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the ras  nitrate reduction was limited because ras rate is limited by the performance of the clarifier 
the  modified ludzak-ettinger process   mle  is an improvement on the original concept  for it recycles mixed liquor from the discharge end of the aeration tank to the head of the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria  in this instance  raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source  and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen 
many sewage treatment plants use
to transfer the nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification  these pumps are often referred to as internal mixed liquor recycle  imlr  pumps  imlr may be 200  to 400  the flow rate of influent wastewater  q   this is in addition to return activated sludge  ras  from secondary clarifiers  which may be 100  of q   therefore  the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400  of annual average design flow  aadf   at times  the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol  acetate  or simple food waste  molasses  whey  plant starch  to improve the treatment efficiency  these carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility s organic loading 
further modifications to the mle were to come  bardenpho and biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas  use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria  thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater  even newer improvements  such as
process  interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification  shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas  saving energy  alkalinity  and secondary carbon sourcing  anammox  anaerobic ammonia oxidation  works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria through the use of substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification  many other proprietary schemes are being deployed  including demon  sharon-anammox  anita-mox  and deammon  the bacteria
can remove ammonium from waste water
through anaerobic oxidation of ammonium to   a form of rocket fuel 
phosphorus removal  
every adult human excretes between 200 and 1000 grams of phosphorus annually  studies of united states sewage in the late 1960s estimated mean per capita contributions of 500 grams in urine and feces  1000 grams in synthetic detergents  and lesser variable amounts used as corrosion and scale control chemicals in water supplies  source control via alternative detergent formulations has subsequently reduced the largest contribution  but the content of urine and feces will remain unchanged  phosphorus removal is important as it is a limiting nutrient for algae growth in many fresh water systems   for a description of the negative effects of algae  see    it is also particularly important for water reuse systems where high phosphorus concentrations may lead to fouling of downstream equipment such as  
phosphorus can be removed biologically in a process called   in this process  specific bacteria  called
 paos   are selectively enriched and accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells  up to 20 percent of their mass   when the biomass enriched in these bacteria is separated from the treated water  these
have a high
value 
phosphorus removal can also be achieved by chemical   usually with
of
 e g    
 e g     or lime  18 this may lead to excessive sludge production as hydroxides precipitates and the added chemicals can be expensive  chemical phosphorus removal requires significantly smaller equipment footprint than biological removal  is easier to operate and is often more reliable than biological phosphorus removal    another method for phosphorus removal is to use granular  
once removed  phosphorus  in the form of a phosphate-rich   may be dumped in a landfill or used as fertilizer  in the latter case  the treated sewage sludge is also sometimes referred to as biosolids 
disinfection  
further information 
the purpose of
in the treatment of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of
in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking  bathing  irrigation  etc  the effectiveness of disinfection depends on the quality of the water being treated  e g   cloudiness  ph  etc    the type of disinfection being used  the disinfectant dosage  concentration and time   and other environmental variables  cloudy water will be treated less successfully  since solid matter can shield organisms  especially from
or if contact times are low  generally  short contact times  low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection  common methods of disinfection include     ultraviolet light  or sodium hypochlorite  16   which is used for drinking water  is not used in the treatment of waste water because of its persistence  after multiple steps of disinfection  the treated water is ready to be released back into the water cycle by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture  afterwards  the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses 
remains the most common form of waste water disinfection in
due to its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness  one disadvantage is that chlorination of residual organic material can generate chlorinated-organic compounds that may be
or harmful to the environment  residual chlorine or chloramines may also be capable of chlorinating organic material in the natural aquatic environment  further  because residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species  the treated effluent must also be chemically dechlorinated  adding to the complexity and cost of treatment 
 uv  light can be used instead of chlorine  iodine  or other chemicals  because no chemicals are used  the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it  as may be the case with other methods  uv radiation causes damage to the
structure of bacteria    and other   making them incapable of reproduction  the key disadvantages of uv disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the uv radiation  i e   any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the uv light   in the united kingdom  uv light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water  some sewage treatment systems in canada and the us also use uv light for their effluent water disinfection 
 3  is generated by passing oxygen  2  through a high
potential resulting in a third oxygen
becoming attached and forming 3  ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with  thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms  ozone is considered to be safer than chlorine because  unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site  highly poisonous in the event of an accidental release   ozone is generated on-site as needed  ozonation also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination  a disadvantage of ozone disinfection is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators 
fourth treatment stage  
further information 
micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals  ingredients of household chemicals  chemicals used in small businesses or industries 
 eppp  or pesticides may not be eliminated in the conventional treatment process  primary  secondary and tertiary treatment  and therefore lead to   although concentrations of those substances and their decompostion products are quite low  there is still a chance to harm aquatic organisms  for   the following substances have been identified as  toxicologically relevant   substances with
effects 
substances and substances that enhance the development of   they mainly belong to the group of   techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in germany  switzerland   and the netherlands  however  since those techniques are still costly  they are not yet applied on a regular basis  such process steps mainly consist of
filters that adsorb the micropollutants  ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method  also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation  a new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants and at the same time to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells  microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater 
to reduce pharmaceuticals in water bodies  also  source control  measures are under investigation  such as innovations in drug development or more responsible handling of drugs 
odor control  
emitted by sewage treatment are typically an indication of an anaerobic or  septic  condition  early stages of processing will tend to produce foul-smelling gases  with
being most common in generating complaints  large process plants in urban areas will often treat the odors with carbon reactors  a contact media with bio-slimes  small doses of   or circulating fluids to biologically capture and metabolize the noxious gases  other methods of odor control exist  including addition of iron salts      etc  to manage
levels 
are suitable for reducing odors by conveying sludge through hermetic closed pipework 
energy requirements  
for conventional sewage treatment plants  around 30 percent of the annual operating costs is usually required for energy  1703 the energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load  for example 
have a lower energy requirement than
plants  as less energy is required for the aeration step 
in their
process with
can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself  1505
in conventional secondary treatment processes  most of the electricity is used for aeration  pumping systems and equipment for the dewatering and drying of   advanced wastewater treatment plants  e g  for nutrient removal  require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or secondary treatment  1704
sludge treatment and disposal  
main article 
the sludges accumulated in a wastewater treatment process must be treated and disposed of in a safe and effective manner  the purpose of digestion is to reduce the amount of
and the number of disease-causing
present in the solids  the most common treatment options include     and  
is also used  albeit to a much lesser degree  1921
sludge treatment depends on the amount of solids generated and other site-specific conditions  composting is most often applied to small-scale plants with aerobic digestion for mid-sized operations  and anaerobic digestion for the larger-scale operations 
the sludge is sometimes passed through a so-called pre-thickener which de-waters the sludge  types of pre-thickeners include centrifugal sludge thickeners rotary drum sludge thickeners and belt filter presses  dewatered sludge may be incinerated or transported offsite for disposal in a landfill or use as an agricultural soil amendment 
environment aspects  
the outlet of the
sewage treatment plant flows into the  
many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes that occur in the environment  whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground  if not overloaded  bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants  although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall
of the receiving water  native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants  and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to
radiation  consequently  in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution  a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required  however  recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater  including
 from
and residue from human
methods  and synthetic materials such as
that mimic hormones in their action  can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water  in the us and   uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law  and strict water quality requirements are to be met  as clean drinking water is essential   for requirements in the us  see    a significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries 
effects on biology  
sewage treatment plants can have multiple effects on nutrient levels in the water that the treated sewage flows into  these nutrients can have large effects on the biological life in the water in contact with the effluent 
 or sewage treatment ponds  can include any of the following 
oxidation ponds  which are aerobic bodies of water usually 12 meters in depth that receive effluent from sedimentation tanks or other forms of primary treatment 
dominated by
polishing ponds are similar to oxidation ponds but receive effluent from an oxidation pond or from a plant with an extended mechanical treatment 
dominated by
  raw sewage lagoons  or sewage lagoons are ponds where sewage is added with no primary treatment other than coarse screening  these ponds provide effective treatment when the surface remains aerobic  although anaerobic conditions may develop near the layer of settled sludge on the bottom of the pond  552554
anaerobic lagoons are heavily loaded ponds 
dominated by
sludge lagoons are aerobic ponds  usually 2 to 5 meters in depth  that receive anaerobically digested primary sludge  or activated secondary sludge under water 
upper layers are dominated by algae
phosphorus limitation is a possible result from sewage treatment and results in flagellate-dominated   particularly in summer and fall 
a
study found high nutrient concentrations linked to sewage effluents  high nutrient concentration leads to high
concentrations  which is a proxy for primary production in marine environments  high primary production means high
populations and most likely high zooplankton populations  because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton  however  effluent released into marine systems also leads to greater population instability 
the planktonic trends of high populations close to input of treated sewage is contrasted by the
trend  in a study of
spp  in increasing distance from a wastewater source  greater change in seasonal cycles was found the furthest from the effluent  this trend is so strong that the furthest location studied actually had an inversion of the aeromonas spp  cycle in comparison to that of   since there is a main pattern in the cycles that occurred simultaneously at all stations it indicates seasonal factors  temperature  solar radiation  phytoplankton  control of the bacterial population  the effluent dominant species changes from aeromonas caviae in winter to aeromonas sobria in the spring and fall while the inflow dominant species is aeromonas caviae  which is constant throughout the seasons 
treated sewage reuse  
main article 
with suitable technology  it is possible to reuse sewage effluent for drinking water  although this is usually only done in places with limited water supplies  such as
and  
in israel  about 50 percent of agricultural water use  total use was 1 billion cubic metres in 2008  is provided through reclaimed sewer water  future plans call for increased use of treated sewer water as well as more  
sewage treatment in developing countries  
few reliable figures exist on the share of the wastewater collected in sewers that is being treated in the world  a global estimate by
and
is that 90  of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated  in many developing countries the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without any treatment or after primary treatment only 
in latin america about 15 percent of collected wastewater passes through treatment plants  with varying levels of actual treatment   in   a below average country in
with respect to wastewater treatment  97 percent of the countrys
is discharged raw into the environment  in   a relatively developed
country  the majority of  s population has totally untreated sewage injected to the citys groundwater  however  the construction of major parts of the sewage system  collection and treatment  in tehran is almost complete  and under development  due to be fully completed by the end of 2012  in isfahan  iran s third largest city  sewage treatment was started more than 100 years ago 
only few cities in
have sewer-based sanitation systems  let alone wastewater treatment plants  an exception being south africa and  until the late 1990s- zimbabwe  instead  most urban residents in sub-saharan africa rely on on-site
systems without sewers  such as
and   and
management in these cities is an enormous challenge 
history  
further information 
the
of 1858 stimulated research into the problem of sewage treatment  in this caricature in  
reports to father
on the state of the river 
basic sewer systems were used for waste removal in ancient   where vertical shafts carried the waste away into cesspools  similar systems existed in the
civilization in modern-day india and in ancient
and   in the
the sewer systems built by the
fell into disuse and waste was collected into cesspools that were periodically emptied by workers known as  rakers  who would often sell it as
to farmers outside the city 
modern sewage systems were first built in the mid-nineteenth century as a reaction to the exacerbation of sanitary conditions brought on by heavy
and   due to the contaminated water supply 
outbreaks occurred in
in   killing tens of thousands of people  this  combined with the
of 1858  when the smell of untreated human waste in the
became overpowering  and the report into sanitation reform of the
  led to the
appointing sir
to construct a vast underground sewage system for the safe removal of waste  contrary to chadwick s recommendations  bazalgette s system  and others later built in   did not pump the sewage onto farm land for use as fertilizer  it was simply piped to a natural waterway away from population centres  and pumped back into the environment 
early attempts  
one of the first attempts at diverting sewage for use as a fertilizer in the farm was made by the
owner
in the 1840s  he experimented with a piped distribution system initially proposed by james vetch that collected sewage from his factory and pumped it into the outlying farms  and his success was enthusiastically followed by edwin chadwick and supported by organic chemist  
the idea was officially adopted by the   and various schemes  known as sewage farms  were trialled by different municipalities over the next 50 years  at first  the heavier solids were channeled into ditches on the side of the farm and were covered over when full  but soon flat-bottomed tanks were employed as reservoirs for the sewage  the earliest patent was taken out by william higgs in 1846 for  tanks or reservoirs in which the contents of sewers and drains from cities  towns and villages are to be collected and the solid animal or vegetable matters therein contained  solidified and dried     improvements to the design of the tanks included the introduction of the horizontal-flow tank in the 1850s and the radial-flow tank in 1905  these tanks had to be manually de-sludged periodically  until the introduction of automatic mechanical de-sludgers in the early 1900s 
the precursor to the modern
was the
in which the water was sealed off to prevent contamination and the solid waste was slowly liquified due to anaerobic action  it was invented by l h mouras in france in the 1860s  donald cameron  as
for
patented an improved version in 1895  which he called a  septic tank   septic having the meaning of  bacterial   these are still in worldwide use  especially in rural areas unconnected to large-scale sewage systems 
chemical treatment  
sir   a distinguished chemist  who demonstrated the possibility of chemically treating sewage in the 1870s 
it was not until the late 19th century that it became possible to treat the sewage by chemically breaking it down through the use of
and removing the pollutants  land treatment was also steadily becoming less feasible  as cities grew and the volume of sewage produced could no longer be absorbed by the farmland on the outskirts 
sir
conducted experiments at the sewage farm in   england  during the 1870s and was able to demonstrate that filtration of sewage through porous gravel produced a nitrified effluent  the ammonia was converted into nitrate  and that the filter remained unclogged over long periods of time  this established the then revolutionary possibility of biological treatment of sewage using a contact bed to oxidize the waste  this concept was taken up by the chief chemist for the london   william libdin  in 1887 
   in all probability the true way of purifying sewage   will be first to separate the sludge  and then turn into neutral effluent    retain it for a sufficient period  during which time it should be fully aerated  and finally discharge it into the stream in a purified condition  this is indeed what is aimed at and imperfectly accomplished on a sewage farm 
from 1885 to 1891 filters working on this principle were constructed throughout the uk and the idea was also taken up in the us at the
in   where frankland s work was confirmed  in 1890 the les developed a    that gave a much more reliable performance 
contact beds were developed in  
and by scientists working for the
in the early 1890s  according to christopher hamlin  this was part of a conceptual revolution that replaced the philosophy that saw  sewage purification as the prevention of decomposition with one that tried to facilitate the biological process that destroy sewage naturally  
contact beds were tanks containing the inert substance  such as stones or slate  that maximized the surface area available for the microbial growth to break down the sewage  the sewage was held in the tank until it was fully decomposed and it was then filtered out into the ground  this method quickly became widespread  especially in the uk  where it was used in    
and   the bacterial bed was simultaneously developed by joseph corbett as borough engineer in
and experiments in 1905 showed that his method was superior in that greater volumes of sewage could be purified better for longer periods of time than could be achieved by the contact bed 
the royal commission on sewage disposal published its eighth report in 1912 that set what became the international standard for sewage discharge into rivers  the  20 30 standard   which allowed 20mg
and 30mg suspended solid per litre
