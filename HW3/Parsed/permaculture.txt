permaculture is a system of
and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural   permaculture was developed  and the term coined by
and
in 1978 
it has many branches that include but are not limited to      
and
that develops   and regenerative and self-maintained
and agricultural systems modeled from natural ecosystems 
mollison has said   permaculture is a philosophy of working with  rather than against nature  of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor  and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions  rather than treating any area as a

history  
in 1929  joseph russell smith took up an antecedent term as the subtitle for tree crops  a permanent agriculture  a book in which he summed up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed  smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath  this book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable  such as
who pioneered
in
in the 1930s 
the definition of permanent agriculture as that which can be sustained indefinitely was supported by australian
in his 1964 book water for every farm  yeomans introduced an observation-based approach to land use in australia in the 1940s  and the
as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s 
s works were an early influence noted by holmgren  other early influences include
and   who pioneered   and
who  in the late 1930s in japan  began advocating
orchards  gardens  and  
in january 2008 
in the late 1960s  bill mollison and david holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern australian island state of   this was a result of the danger of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods  in their view 
these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources  and were additionally poisoning land and water  reducing   and removing billions of tons of
from previously fertile landscapes  a design approach called permaculture was their response and was first made public with the publication of their book permaculture one in 1978 
by the early 1980s  the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards   after permaculture one  mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books  notably permaculture  a designers manual  mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week permaculture design course  pdc  to many hundreds of students    mollison  encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites  this multiplier effect was critical to permacultures rapid expansion  
core tenets and principles of design  
the three core tenets of permaculture are 
care for the earth  provision for all life systems to continue and multiply  this is the first principle  because without a healthy earth 
cannot flourish 
care for the people  provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence 
return of surplus  reinvesting surpluses back into the system to provide for the first two ethics  this includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness  the third ethic is sometimes referred to as fair share to reflect that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus 
permaculture design emphasizes patterns of   function  and species assemblies  it determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment  the central concept of permaculture is maximizing useful connections between components and
of the final design  the focus of permaculture  therefore  is not on each separate element  but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together  the whole becoming   permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize   human labor  and energy input by building systems with maximal benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of   permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can become extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input 
the design principles which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture were derived from the science of
and study of pre-industrial examples of
land use  permaculture draws from several disciplines including         and   permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping  integrating techniques such as     and
within the context of permaculture design principles and theory 
theory  
twelve design principles  
twelve permaculture design principles articulated by david holmgren in his permaculture  principles and pathways beyond sustainability 
observe and interact  by taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation 
catch and store energy  by developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance  we can use them in times of need 
obtain a yield  ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing 
apply self-regulation and accept feedback  we need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well 
use and value
resources and services  make the best use of nature s abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources 
produce no waste  by valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us  nothing goes to waste 
design from patterns to details  by stepping back  we can observe patterns in nature and society  these can form the backbone of our designs  with the details filled in as we go 
integrate rather than segregate  by putting the right things in the right place  relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other 
use small and slow solutions  small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones  making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes 
use and value diversity  diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides 
use edges and value the marginal  the interface between things is where the most interesting events take place  these are often the most valuable  diverse and productive elements in the system 
creatively use and respond to change  we can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing  and then intervening at the right time 
layers  
suburban permaculture garden in   uk with different layers of vegetation
layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans  a mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts  trees          insects  and animals  because plants grow to different heights  a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space  as the vegetation occupies different layers  there are generally seven recognized layers in a   although some practitioners also include
as an eighth layer 
the   the tallest trees in the system  large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area  i e  there exist patches barren of trees 
layer  trees that revel in the dappled light under the canopy 
  a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height  includes most berry bushes 
  plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter  if winters are cold enough  that is   they do not produce woody stems as the shrub layer does  many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer  a large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer  may be annuals  biennials or perennials 
soil surface   there is some overlap with the
and the   however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground  grow densely to fill bare patches of soil  and often can tolerate some foot traffic 
retain soil and lessen   along with
that add nutrients and
to the soil  especially  
  root layers within the soil  the major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots  including
such as
and other edible    fungi  insects  nematodes  worms  etc 
vertical layer  climbers or   such as
and
 vine varieties  
guilds  
there are many forms of guilds  including guilds of plants with similar functions  that could interchange within an ecosystem   but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild  such a
is a group of
where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction  or harmony  mutual support guilds are groups of       etc  that work well together  some plants may be grown for food production  some have tap roots that draw nutrients up from deep in the soil  some are nitrogen-fixing   some attract   and others repel harmful insects  when grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement  these plants form a guild  see dave jacke s work on edible forest gardens for more information on other guilds  specifically resource-partitioning and community-function guilds 
edge effect  
the
in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition or placing side by side of contrasting
on an ecosystem  permaculturists argue that  where vastly differing systems meet  there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections  an example of this is the coast  where the land and the sea meet there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs  so this idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in the herb garden or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval  thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area    
zones  
permaculture zones 0-5 
zones are a way of intelligently organizing design elements in a human environment on the basis of the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs  frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2  less frequently used or manipulated elements  and elements that benefit from isolation  such as wild species  are farther away  zones are about positioning things appropriately  and are numbered from 0 to 5   
zone 0
the house  or home center  here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs  harnessing natural resources such as sunlight  and generally creating a harmonious  sustainable environment in which to live and work  zone 0 is an informal designation  which is not specifically defined in s book 
zone 1
the zone nearest to the house  the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention  or that need to be visited often  such as salad crops 
plants  soft fruit like
or  
and   propagation area 
bin for kitchen waste  etc 
are often used in zone 1 in  
zone 2
this area is used for siting
plants that require less frequent maintenance  such as occasional
or   including currant bushes and orchards  pumpkins  sweet potato  etc  this would also be a good place for   larger scale
bins  etc 
zone 3
the area where main-crops are grown  both for domestic use and for trade purposes  after establishment  care and maintenance required are fairly minimal  provided
and similar things are used   such as watering or weed control maybe once a week 
zone 4
a semi-wild area  this zone is mainly used for
and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood 
zone 5
a wilderness area  there is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural
and cycles  through this zone we
that can aid the zones above it 
people and permaculture  
permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems  and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape  there has been a growing awareness though that firstly  there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic  as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects  and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant  healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes 
domesticated animals  
are often incorporated into site design 
common practices  
agroforestry  
is an integrated approach of using the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops and or livestock  it combines agricultural and
technologies to create more diverse  productive  profitable  healthy and sustainable land-use systems  in agroforestry systems  trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems  or
are cultured in forest settings   
is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests  forest gardens  like other permaculture designs  incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems  the terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature  numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens  such as graham bell    dave jacke  eric toensmeier and   bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book the permaculture garden in 1995  whitefield wrote the book how to make a forest garden in 2002  jacke and toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set edible forest gardening in 2005  and lawton presented the film establishing a food forest in 2008 
tree gardens  such as kandyan tree gardens  in south and southeast asia  are often hundreds of years old  whether they derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry  as is the case in agroforestry  or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems  as is the case for permaculture systems  is not self-evident  many studies of these systems  especially those that predate the term permaculture  consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry  permaculturalists who include existing and ancient systems of polycropping with woody species as examples of food forests may obscure the distinction between permaculture and agroforestry 
food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs 
hgelkultur  
is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention  the porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground  during the rainy season  masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season  this technique has been used by permaculturalists       and  
natural building  
a
involves a range of
systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability  ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed  plentiful or   as well as those that  while
or salvaged  produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality 
the basis of natural building is the need to lessen the
impact of buildings and other supporting systems  without sacrificing comfort  health  or   to be more sustainable  natural building uses primarily abundantly available  renewable  reused  or recycled materials  in addition to relying on natural building materials  the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened  the orientation of a building  the utilization of local climate and site conditions  the emphasis on natural ventilation through design  fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment  building compactly and minimizing the
is common  as are on-site handling of energy acquisition  on-site water capture  alternate sewage treatment  and water reuse   
rainwater harvesting  
is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the   it has been used to provide   water for   water for   as well as other typical uses  rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water  it can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery  water collected from the ground  sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose  is called    
is
generated from domestic activities such as laundry  dishwashing  and bathing  which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and   greywater is largely sterile  but not potable  drinkable   greywater differs from water from the toilets  which is designated
or
to indicate it contains   blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused  there are  however  continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste  the most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure  a combination of the words human and manure  additionally  the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel  such as for heating or cooking  and is commonly referred to as biogas  biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure  some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel  this process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing   
sheet mulching  
in agriculture and   mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil  any material or combination can be used as mulch  such as stones  leaves  cardboard  wood chips  gravel  etc   though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions  these include absorbing rainfall  reducing evaporation  providing nutrients  increasing organic matter in the soil  feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms  suppressing weed growth and seed germination  moderating diurnal temperature swings  protecting against frost  and reducing erosion 
is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within   sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors  when deployed properly and in combination with other permacultural principles  it can generate healthy  productive and low maintenance ecosystems   
sheet mulch serves as a  nutrient bank   storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down  it also improves the soil by attracting and feeding  
and many other soil micro-organisms  as well as adding   earthworms  till  the soil  and their
are among the best fertilizers and   sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate undesirable plants by starving them of light  and can be more advantageous than using
or other methods of control   
intensive rotational grazing  
grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment  however  it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature  the opposite effect can be seen  also known as cell grazing 
 mirg  is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds and or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture  range  or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth  this disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth  mirg can be used with cattle  sheep  goats  pigs  chickens  rabbits  geese  turkeys  ducks  and other animals depending on the natural
that is being mimicked 
and
have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start
or prepare ground for planting   s
technique has been likened to  a permaculture approach to    one variation on mirg that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing  often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species  in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be  but are not necessarily  used for meat  milk or fiber 
keyline design  
is a technique for maximizing beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in australia by farmer and engineer   the keyline refers to a specific
linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site 
fruit tree management  
some proponents of permaculture advocate no  or limited  pruning  one advocate of this approach is
who used the method in connection with
  he has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes  approximately 9,000 feet  2,700m   far above their normal altitude  temperature  and snow load ranges  he notes that the hgelkultur berms kept and or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions  the point of having unpruned branches  he notes  was that the longer  more naturally formed  branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground  thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter  pruned  branch   
  as part of early experiments on his family farm in japan  experimented with no-pruning methods  noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go  which made them become convoluted and tangled  and thus unhealthy    then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees    he concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning  so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination  this is part of his implementation of the -philosophy of
translated in part as no-action  against nature   and he described it as no unnecessary pruning  nature farming or  do-nothing  farming  of fruit trees  distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning  he ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation   
trademark and copyright issues  
there has been contention over who  if anyone  controls legal rights to the word permaculture  is it
or   and if so  who holds the legal rights to the use of the word  for a long time bill mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word  and his books said on the    the contents of this book and the word permaculture are copyright   these statements were largely accepted at face-value within the permaculture community  however  copyright law does not protect names  ideas  concepts  systems  or methods of doing something  it only protects the expression or the description of an idea  not the idea itself  eventually mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word permaculture 
in 2000  mollison s us based permaculture institute sought a
 a form of trademark  for the word permaculture when used in educational services such as conducting classes  seminars  or workshops  the service mark would have allowed mollison and his two permaculture institutes  one in the us and one in australia  to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it  particularly with relation to the pdc  despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the pdc in 1993  the service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001  also in 2001 mollison applied for trademarks in australia for the terms  permaculture design course  and  permaculture design   these applications were both withdrawn in 2003  in 2009 he sought a trademark for  permaculture  a designers manual  and  introduction to permaculture   the names of two of his books  these applications were withdrawn in 2011  there has never been a trademark for the word permaculture in australia 
criticisms  
general criticisms  
in 2011  owen hablutzel argued that  permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance   and that  the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant  
in his books sustainable freshwater aquaculture and farming in ponds and dams  nick romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in bill mollison s books is unrealistic and misleading 
agroforestry  
greg williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests decline as they mature due to   proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation  but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest    for example  ecological succession generally results in a forest s productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the woodland state  67  tree cover   before declining until full maturity
