electric power transmission is the bulk movement of
from a generating site  such as a   to an   the interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network  this is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers  which is typically referred to as   the combined transmission and distribution network is known as the    in   or just  the grid   in the   the network is known as the  national grid  
a   also known as an  interconnection  in north america  directly connects a large number of generators delivering ac power with the same relative frequency to a large number of consumers  for example  there are four major interconnections in north america  the   the   the
and the
 ercot  grid   and  
the same relative frequency  but almost never the same relative phase as ac power interchange is a function of the phase difference between any two nodes in the network  and zero degrees difference means no power is interchanged  any phase difference up to 90 degrees is stable by the  equal area criteria   any phase difference above 90 degrees is absolutely unstable  the interchange partners are responsible for maintaining frequency as close to the
as is practical  and the phase differences between any two nodes significantly less than 90 degrees  should 90 degrees be exceeded  a system separation is executed  and remains separated until the trouble has been corrected 
historically  transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company  but starting in the 1990s  many countries have

 typically longer than 30 miles  50km    and in the interchange of power between grids that are not mutually synchronized  hvdc links are used to stabilize large power distribution networks where sudden new loads  or blackouts  in one part of a network can result in synchronization problems and

a lack of electrical energy storage facilities in transmission systems leads to a key limitation  electrical energy must be generated at the same rate at which it is consumed  a sophisticated control system is required to ensure that the
very closely matches the demand  if the demand for power exceeds supply  the imbalance can cause generation plant s  and transmission equipment to automatically disconnect and or shut down to prevent damage  in the worst case  this may lead to a cascading series of shut downs and a major regional   examples include the us northeast blackouts of       and major blackouts in other us regions in
and   electric transmission networks are interconnected into regional  national  and even continent wide networks to reduce the risk of such a failure by providing multiple   alternative routes for power to flow should such shut downs occur  transmission companies determine the maximum reliable capacity of each line  ordinarily less than its physical or thermal limit  to ensure that spare capacity is available in the event of a failure in another part of the network

high-voltage overhead conductors are not covered by insulation  the conductor material is nearly always an
alloy  made into several strands and possibly reinforced with steel strands  copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission  but aluminum is lighter  yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less  overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide  improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits  conductor sizes range from 12mm2   6   to 750mm2  1,590,000 circular mils area   with varying resistance and   thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the   that causes most of the current to flow close to the surface of the wire  because of this current limitation  multiple parallel cables  called   are used when higher capacity is needed  bundle conductors are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by

since overhead transmission wires depend on air for insulation  the design of these lines requires minimum clearances to be observed to maintain safety  adverse weather conditions  such as high wind and low temperatures  can lead to power outages  wind speeds as low as 23 knots  43km h  can permit conductors to encroach operating clearances  resulting in a

history  
main article 
new york city streets in 1890  besides telegraph lines  multiple electric lines were required for each class of device requiring different voltages
in the early days of commercial electric power  transmission of electric power at the same voltage as used by lighting and mechanical loads restricted the distance between generating plant and consumers  in 1882  generation was with
 dc   which could not easily be increased in voltage for long-distance transmission  different classes of loads  for example  lighting  fixed motors  and traction railway systems  required different voltages  and so used different generators and circuits 
due to this specialization of lines and because transmission was inefficient for low-voltage high-current circuits  generators needed to be near their loads  it seemed  at the time  that the industry would develop into what is now known as a
system with large numbers of small generators located near their loads 
the transmission of electric power with
 ac  became possible after
and
built what they called the secondary generator  an early transformer provided with 1 1 turn ratio and open magnetic circuit  in 1881 
the first long distance  34km  21mi   ac line was built for the 1884 international exhibition of   it was powered by a 2000-v  130hz
alternator and featured several gaulard secondary generators with their primary windings connected in series  which fed incandescent lamps  the system proved the feasibility of ac electric power transmission on long distances 
a very first operative ac line was put into service in 1885 in via dei cerchi    for public lighting  it was powered by two siemens   halske alternators rated 30 hp  22 kw   2000-v at 120 hz and used 19 km of cables and 200 parallel-connected 2000-v 20-v step-down transformers provided with a closed magnetic circuit  one for each lamp  few months later it was followed by the first british ac system  which was put into service at the   london  it also featured siemens alternators and 2400-v 100-v step-down transformers  one per user  with shunt-connected primaries 
working for westinghouse  william stanley jr  spent his time recovering from illness in great barrington installing what is considered the worlds first practical ac transformer system 
working from what he considered an impractical gaulard-gibbs design  electrical engineer
developed what is considered the first practical series ac transformer in 1885  working with the support of   in 1886 he installed demonstration transformer based alternating current lighting system in   powered by a steam engine driven 500-v siemens generator  voltage was stepped down to 100 volts using the new stanley transformer to power incandescent lamps at 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet  this practical demonstration of a transformer alternating current lighting system would lead westinghouse to begin installing ac based systems later that year 
in 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional   something these systems had lacked up till then  the design  an
running on
current  was independently invented by
and
 with tesla s design being licensed by westinghouse in the us   this design was further developed into the modern practical
form by
and  
the late 1880s early 1890s would see a financial merger of many smaller electric companies into a few larger corporations such as
and
in europe and
and
in the us  these companies continued to develop ac systems but the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems would follow a much longer technical merger  due to innovation in the us and europe  alternating current s economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied  these included single phase ac systems  poly-phase ac systems  low voltage incandescent lighting  high voltage arc lighting  and existing dc motors in factories and street cars  in what was becoming a universal system  these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of
and
that would allow the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the ac grid  these stopgaps would slowly be replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded

generators on display at the 1893   part of their  tesla poly-phase system   such polyphase innovations revolutionized transmission
the first transmission of three-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in 1891 during the
in   a 15,000-v transmission line  approximately 175km long  connected
and frankfurt 
voltages used for electric power transmission increased throughout the 20th century  by 1914  fifty-five transmission systems each operating at more than 70,000-v were in service  the highest voltage then used was 150,000v  by allowing multiple generating plants to be interconnected over a wide area  electricity production cost was reduced  the most efficient available plants could be used to supply the varying loads during the day  reliability was improved and capital investment cost was reduced  since stand-by generating capacity could be shared over many more customers and a wider geographic area  remote and low-cost sources of energy  such as
power or mine-mouth coal  could be exploited to lower energy production cost 
the rapid industrialization in the 20th century made electrical transmission lines and grids a
item in most industrialized nations  the interconnection of local generation plants and small distribution networks was greatly spurred by the requirements of   with large electrical generating plants built by governments to provide power to munitions factories  later these generating plants were connected to supply civil loads through long-distance transmission

engineers design transmission networks to transport the energy as efficiently as feasible  while at the same time taking into account economic factors  network safety and redundancy  these networks use components such as power lines  cables    switches and   the transmission network is usually administered on a regional basis by an entity such as a
or  
transmission efficiency is greatly improved by devices that increase the voltage  and thereby proportionately reduce the current   in the line conductors  thus allowing power to be transmitted with acceptable losses  the reduced current flowing through the line reduces the heating losses in the conductors  according to   energy losses are directly proportional to the square of the current  thus  reducing the current by a factor of two will lower the energy lost to conductor resistance by a factor of four for any given size of conductor 
the optimum size of a conductor for a given voltage and current can be estimated by   which states that the size is at its optimum when the annual cost of energy wasted in the resistance is equal to the annual capital charges of providing the conductor  at times of lower interest rates  kelvin s law indicates that thicker wires are optimal  while  when metals are expensive  thinner conductors are indicated  however  power lines are designed for long-term use  so kelvin s law has to be used in conjunction with long-term estimates of the price of copper and aluminum as well as interest rates for capital 
the increase in voltage is achieved in ac circuits by using a step-up  
systems require relatively costly conversion equipment which may be economically justified for particular projects such as submarine cables and longer distance high capacity point to point transmission  hvdc is necessary for the import and export of energy between grid systems that are not synchronized with each other 
a transmission grid is a network of   transmission lines  and   energy is usually transmitted within a grid with
  single-phase ac is used only for distribution to end users since it is not usable for large polyphase   in the 19th century  two-phase transmission was used but required either four wires or three wires with unequal currents  higher order phase systems require more than three wires  but deliver little or no benefit 
the
of the
the price of electric power station capacity is high  and electric demand is variable  so it is often cheaper to import some portion of the needed power than to generate it locally  because loads are often regionally correlated  hot weather in the southwest portion of the us might cause many people to use air conditioners   electric power often comes from distant sources  because of the economic benefits of load sharing between regions 
now span countries and even continents  the web of interconnections between power producers and consumers should enable power to flow  even if some links are inoperative 
the unvarying  or slowly varying over many hours  portion of the electric demand is known as the
and is generally served by large facilities  which are more efficient due to economies of scale  with fixed costs for fuel and operation  such facilities are nuclear  coal-fired or hydroelectric  while other energy sources such as
and
have the potential to provide base load power  renewable energy sources  such as solar photovoltaics  wind  wave  and tidal  are  due to their intermittency  not considered as supplying  base load  but will still add power to the grid  the remaining or  peak  power demand  is supplied by   which are typically smaller  faster-responding  and higher cost sources  such as combined cycle or combustion turbine plants fueled by natural gas 
long-distance transmission of electricity  thousands of kilometers  is cheap and efficient  with costs of us 0.0050.02 kwh  compared to annual averaged large producer costs of us 0.010.025 kwh  retail rates upwards of us 0.10 kwh  and multiples of retail for instantaneous suppliers at unpredicted highest demand moments   thus distant suppliers can be cheaper than local sources  e g   new york often buys over 1000 mw of electricity from canada   multiple local sources  even if more expensive and infrequently used  can make the transmission grid more fault tolerant to weather and other disasters that can disconnect distant suppliers

long-distance transmission allows remote renewable energy resources to be used to displace fossil fuel consumption  hydro and wind sources cannot be moved closer to populous cities  and solar costs are lowest in remote areas where local power needs are minimal  connection costs alone can determine whether any particular renewable alternative is economically sensible  costs can be prohibitive for transmission lines  but various proposals for massive infrastructure investment in high capacity  very long distance
transmission networks could be recovered with modest usage fees 
grid input  
at the   the power is produced at a relatively low voltage between about 2.3kv and 30kv  depending on the size of the unit  the generator terminal voltage is then stepped up by the power station
to a higher
 115kv to 765kv ac  varying by the transmission system and by country  for transmission over long distances 
losses  
transmitting electricity at high voltage reduces the fraction of energy lost to   which varies depending on the specific conductors  the current flowing  and the length of the transmission line  for example  a 100-mile  160km  765kv line carrying 1000 mw of power can have losses of 1.1  to 0.5   a 345kv line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2   for a given amount of power  a higher voltage reduces the current and thus the
in the conductor  for example  raising the voltage by a factor of 10 reduces the current by a corresponding factor of 10 and therefore the i2r losses by a factor of 100  provided the same sized conductors are used in both cases  even if the conductor size  cross-sectional area  is reduced 10-fold to match the lower current  the i2r losses are still reduced 10-fold  long-distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200kv  at extremely high voltages  more than 2,000kv exists between conductor and ground 
losses are so large that they can offset the lower resistive losses in the line conductors  measures to reduce corona losses include conductors having larger diameters  often hollow to save weight  or bundles of two or more conductors 
factors that affect the resistance  and thus loss  of conductors used in transmission and distribution lines include temperature  spiraling  and the   the resistance of a conductor increases with its temperature  temperature changes in electric power lines can have a significant effect on power losses in the line  spiraling  which refers to the increase in conductor resistance due to the way stranded conductors spiral about the center  also contributes to increases in conductor resistance  the skin effect causes the effective resistance of a conductor to increase at higher alternating current frequencies 
transmission and distribution losses in the usa were estimated at 6.6  in 1997 and 6.5  in 2007  in general  losses are estimated from the discrepancy between power produced  as reported by power plants  and power sold to the end customers  the difference between what is produced and what is consumed constitute transmission and distribution losses  assuming no utility theft occurs 
as of 1980  the longest cost-effective distance for
transmission was determined to be 7,000km  4,300mi   for
it was 4,000km  2,500mi   though all transmission lines in use today are substantially shorter than this 
in any alternating current transmission line  the
and capacitance of the conductors can be significant  currents that flow solely in  reaction  to these properties of the circuit   which together with the
define the   constitute
flow  which transmits no  real  power to the load  these reactive currents  however  are very real and cause extra heating losses in the transmission circuit  the ratio of  real  power  transmitted to the load  to  apparent  power  sum of  real  and  reactive   is the   as reactive current increases  the reactive power increases and the power factor decreases  for transmission systems with low power factor  losses are higher than for systems with high power factor  utilities add capacitor banks  reactors and other components  such as     and   facts  throughout the system to compensate for the reactive power flow and reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages  these measures are collectively called  reactive support  
transposition  
current flowing through transmission lines induces a magnetic field that surrounds the lines of each phase and affects the
of the surrounding conductors of other phases  the mutual inductance of the conductors is partially dependent on the physical orientation of the lines with respect to each other  three-phase power transmission lines are conventionally strung with phases separated on different vertical levels  the mutual inductance seen by a conductor of the phase in the middle of the other two phases will be different than the inductance seen by the conductors on the top or bottom  because of this phenomenon  conductors must be periodically transposed along the length of the transmission line so that each phase sees equal time in each relative position to balance out the mutual inductance seen by all three phases  to accomplish this  line position is swapped at specially designed
at regular intervals along the length of the transmission line in various

subtransmission is part of an electric power transmission system that runs at relatively lower voltages  it is uneconomical to connect all
to the high main transmission voltage  because the equipment is larger and more expensive  typically  only larger substations connect with this high voltage  it is stepped down and sent to smaller substations in towns and neighborhoods  subtransmission circuits are usually arranged in loops so that a single line failure does not cut off service to a large number of customers for more than a short time  loops can be  normally closed   where loss of one circuit should result in no interruption  or  normally open  where substations can switch to a backup supply  while subtransmission circuits are usually carried on   in urban areas buried cable may be used  the lower-voltage subtransmission lines use less right-of-way and simpler structures  it is much more feasible to put them underground where needed  higher-voltage lines require more space and are usually above-ground since putting them underground is very expensive 
there is no fixed cutoff between subtransmission and transmission  or subtransmission and   the voltage ranges overlap somewhat  voltages of 69kv  115kv and 138kv are often used for subtransmission in north america  as power systems evolved  voltages formerly used for transmission were used for subtransmission  and subtransmission voltages became distribution voltages  like transmission  subtransmission moves relatively large amounts of power  and like distribution  subtransmission covers an area instead of just point to point

modeling  the transmission matrix  
oftentimes  we are only interested in the terminal characteristics of the transmission line  which are the voltage and current at the sending and receiving ends  the transmission line itself is then modeled as a  black box  and a 2 by 2 transmission matrix is used to model its behavior  as follows 
the line is assumed to be a reciprocal  symmetrical network  meaning that the receiving and sending labels can be switched with no consequence  the transmission matrix t also has the following properties

the lossless line approximation  which is the least accurate model  is often used on short lines when the inductance of the line is much greater than its resistance  for this approximation  the voltage and current are identical at the sending and receiving ends 
the short line approximation is normally used for lines less than 50 miles long  for a short line  only a series impedance z is considered  while c and y are ignored  the final result is that a   d   1 per unit  b   z ohms  and c   0 
transmission matrix for the short line approximation
the medium line approximation is used for lines between 50 and 150 miles long  in this model  the series impedance and the shunt admittance are considered  with half of the shunt admittance being placed at each end of the line  this circuit is often referred to as a  nominal pi  circuit because of the shape that is taken on when admittance is placed on both sides of the circuit diagram  the analysis of the medium line brings one to the following result 
the long line model is used when a higher degree of accuracy is needed or when the line under consideration is more than 150 miles long  series resistance and shunt admittance are considered as distributed parameters  meaning each differential length of the line has a corresponding differential resistance and shunt admittance  the following result can be applied at any point along the transmission line  where gamma is defined as the

high-voltage direct current  
main article 
high-voltage direct current  hvdc  is used to transmit large amounts of power over long distances or for interconnections between asynchronous grids  when electrical energy is to be transmitted over very long distances  the power lost in ac transmission becomes appreciable and it is less expensive to use
instead of   for a very long transmission line  these lower losses  and reduced construction cost of a dc line  can offset the additional cost of the required converter stations at each end 
is also used for
because ac cannot be supplied over distances of more than about 30 kilometres  19mi   due to the fact that the cables produce too much reactive power    in these cases special
for dc are used  submarine hvdc systems are often used to connect the electricity grids of islands  for example  between
and   between great britain and   between
and the
mainland  and between the north and south islands of   submarine connections up to 600 kilometres  370mi  in length are presently in use 
hvdc links can be used to control problems in the grid with ac electricity flow  the power transmitted by an ac line increases as the
between source end voltage and destination ends increases  but too large a phase angle will allow the systems at either end of the line to fall out of step  since the power flow in a dc link is controlled independently of the phases of the ac networks at either end of the link  this phase angle limit does not exist  and a dc link is always able to transfer its full rated power  a dc link therefore stabilizes the ac grid at either end  since power flow and phase angle can then be controlled independently 
as an example  to adjust the flow of ac power on a hypothetical line between
and
would require adjustment of the relative phase of the two regional electrical grids  this is an everyday occurrence in ac systems  but one that can become disrupted when ac system components fail and place unexpected loads on the remaining working grid system  with an hvdc line instead  such an interconnection would   1  convert ac in seattle into hvdc   2  use hvdc for the 3,000 miles of cross-country transmission  and  3  convert the hvdc to locally synchronized ac in boston   and possibly in other cooperating cities along the transmission route   such a system could be less prone to failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down  one example of a long dc transmission line is the
located in the western  
capacity  
the amount of power that can be sent over a transmission line is limited  the origins of the limits vary depending on the length of the line  for a short line  the heating of conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit  if too much current is drawn  conductors may sag too close to the ground  or conductors and equipment may be damaged by overheating  for intermediate-length lines on the order of 100km  62mi   the limit is set by the
in the line  for longer ac lines 
sets the limit to the power that can be transferred  approximately  the power flowing over an ac line is proportional to the cosine of the phase angle of the voltage and current at the receiving and transmitting ends  this angle varies depending on system loading and generation  it is undesirable for the angle to approach 90 degrees  as the power flowing decreases but the resistive losses remain  very approximately  the allowable product of line length and maximum load is proportional to the square of the system voltage  series capacitors or phase-shifting transformers are used on long lines to improve stability 
lines are restricted only by thermal and voltage drop limits  since the phase angle is not material to their operation 
up to now  it has been almost impossible to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route  so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization  the availability of industrial
 dts  systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable is a first step in monitoring the transmission system capacity  this monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors  either integrated directly inside a high voltage cable or mounted externally on the cable insulation  a solution for overhead lines is also available  in this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines  oppc   the integrated dynamic cable rating  dcr  or also called real time thermal rating  rttr  solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a high voltage cable circuit in real time  but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum  furthermore  it provides the ability to the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system upon major changes made to its initial operating conditions 
control  
to ensure safe and predictable operation  the components of the transmission system are controlled with generators  switches  circuit breakers and loads  the voltage  power  frequency  load factor  and reliability capabilities of the transmission system are designed to provide cost effective performance for the customers 
load balancing  
the transmission system provides for base load and   with safety and fault tolerance margins  the peak load times vary by region largely due to the industry mix  in very hot and very cold climates home air conditioning and heating loads have an effect on the overall load  they are typically highest in the late afternoon in the hottest part of the year and in mid-mornings and mid-evenings in the coldest part of the year  this makes the power requirements vary by the season and the time of day  distribution system designs always take the base load and the peak load into consideration 
the transmission system usually does not have a large buffering capability to match the loads with the generation  thus generation has to be kept matched to the load  to prevent overloading failures of the generation equipment 
multiple sources and loads can be connected to the transmission system and they must be controlled to provide orderly transfer of power  in centralized power generation  only local control of generation is necessary  and it involves   to prevent large transients and overload conditions 
in
the generators are geographically distributed and the process to bring them online and offline must be carefully controlled  the load control signals can either be sent on separate lines or on the power lines themselves  voltage and frequency can be used as signalling mechanisms to balance the loads 
in voltage signaling  the variation of voltage is used to increase generation  the power added by any system increases as the line voltage decreases  this arrangement is stable in principle  voltage-based regulation is complex to use in mesh networks  since the individual components and setpoints would need to be reconfigured every time a new generator is added to the mesh 
in frequency signaling  the generating units match the frequency of the power transmission system  in   if the frequency decreases  the power is increased   the drop in line frequency is an indication that the increased load is causing the generators to slow down  
 
and other distributed storage and generation systems can be connected to the power grid  and interact with it to improve system operation   
failure protection  
under excess load conditions  the system can be designed to fail gracefully rather than all at once 
occur when the supply power drops below the demand 
occur when the supply fails completely 
 also called load shedding  are intentionally engineered electrical power outages  used to distribute insufficient power when the demand for electricity exceeds the supply 
communications  
operators of long transmission lines require reliable communications for
of the power grid and  often  associated generation and distribution facilities  fault-sensing
at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the flow of power into and out of the protected line section so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored  protection of the transmission line from
and other faults is usually so critical that
telecommunications are insufficiently reliable  and in remote areas a common carrier may not be available  communication systems associated with a transmission project may use 
rarely  and for short distances  a utility will use pilot-wires strung along the transmission line path  leased circuits from common carriers are not preferred since availability is not under control of the electric power transmission organization 
transmission lines can also be used to carry data  this is called power-line carrier  or   plc signals can be easily received with a radio for the long wave range 
optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a transmission line  in the overhead shield wires  these cables are known as
 opgw   sometimes a standalone cable is used  all-dielectric self-supporting  adss  cable  attached to the transmission line cross arms 
some jurisdictions  such as   prohibit energy transmission companies from selling surplus communication bandwidth or acting as a telecommunications   where the regulatory structure permits  the utility can sell capacity in extra
to a common carrier  providing another revenue stream 
electricity market reform  
main article 
some regulators regard electric transmission to be a
and there are moves in many countries to separately regulate transmission  see   
was the first country to establish a regional transmission organization  in that country  transmission operations and market operations are controlled by separate companies  the transmission system operator is
 ree  and the wholesale electricity market operator is operador del mercado ibrico de energa  polo espaol  s a   omel    spain s transmission system is interconnected with those of france  portugal  and morocco 
in the united states and parts of canada  electrical transmission companies operate independently of generation and distribution companies 
cost of electric power transmission  
the cost of high voltage electricity transmission  as opposed to the costs of   is comparatively low  compared to all other costs arising in a consumer s electricity bill  in the uk  transmission costs are about 0.2p kwh compared to a delivered domestic price of around 10p kwh 
research evaluates the level of capital expenditure in the electric power t d equipment market will be worth  128.9bn in 2011 
merchant transmission  
merchant transmission is an arrangement where a third party constructs and operates electric transmission lines through the franchise area of an unrelated utility 
operating merchant transmission projects in the
include the
from
to   neptune rts transmission line from sayreville  n j   to newbridge  n y  and
in california  additional projects are in development or have been proposed throughout the united states  including the lake erie connector  an underwater transmission line proposed by itc holdings corp   connecting ontario to load serving entities in the pjm interconnection region 
there is only one unregulated or market interconnector in  
between tasmania and victoria  two dc links originally implemented as market interconnectors 
and   have been converted to regulated interconnectors 
a major barrier to wider adoption of merchant transmission is the difficulty in identifying who benefits from the facility so that the beneficiaries will pay the toll  also  it is difficult for a merchant transmission line to compete when the alternative transmission lines are subsidized by other utility businesses 
health concerns  
main article 
some large studies  including a large study in the united states  have failed to find any link between living near power lines and developing any sickness or diseases  such as cancer  a 1997 study found that it did not matter how close one was to a power line or a sub-station  there was no increased risk of cancer or illness 
the mainstream scientific evidence suggests that low-power  low-frequency  electromagnetic radiation associated with household currents and high transmission power lines does not constitute a short or long term health hazard  some studies  however  have found
between various diseases and living or working near power lines  no adverse health effects have been substantiated for people not living close to powerlines 
there are established biological effects for
high level exposure to magnetic fields well above 100  1   in a residential setting  there is  limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals   in particular  childhood leukemia  associated with average exposure to residential power-frequency magnetic field above 0.3t  3mg  to 0.4t  4mg   these levels exceed average residential power-frequency magnetic fields in homes  which are about 0.07t  0.7mg  in europe and 0.11t  1.1mg  in north america 
the earth s natural geomagnetic field strength varies over the surface of the planet between 0.035 mt - 0.07 mt  35 t - 70 t or 0.35 g - 0.7 g  while the international standard for the continuous exposure limit is set at 40 mt  40,000 t or 400 g  for the general public 
tree growth regulator and herbicide control methods may be used in transmission line right of ways which may have  
united states government policy  
the examples and perspective in this article may not represent a
of the subject  you may   discuss the issue on the   or   as appropriate   march 2013    
historically  local governments have exercised authority over the grid and have significant disincentives to encourage actions that would benefit states other than their own  localities with cheap electricity have a disincentive to encourage making
in electricity trading easier  since other regions will be able to compete for local energy and drive up rates  for example  some regulators in maine do not wish to address congestion problems because the congestion serves to keep maine rates low  further  vocal local constituencies can block or slow permitting by pointing to visual impact  environmental  and perceived health concerns  in the us  generation is growing four times faster than transmission  but big transmission upgrades require the coordination of multiple states  a multitude of interlocking permits  and cooperation between a significant portion of the 500 companies that own the grid  from a policy perspective  the control of the grid is   and even former
refers to it as a third world grid  there have been efforts in the eu and us to confront the problem  the us national security interest in significantly growing transmission capacity drove passage of the
giving the department of energy the authority to approve transmission if states refuse to act  however  soon after the department of energy used its power to designate two   14 senators signed a letter stating the doe was being too aggressive 
special transmission  
grids for railways  
main article 
in some countries where
or
run on low frequency ac power  there are separate single phase
operated by the railways  prime examples are countries in europe  including  
and   which utilize the older ac technology based on 16 2/3hz  norway and sweden also use this frequency but use conversion from the 50hz public supply  sweden has a 16 2/3hz traction grid but only for part of the system  
superconducting cables  
 hts  promise to revolutionize power distribution by providing lossless transmission of electrical power  the development of superconductors with transition temperatures higher than the boiling point of
has made the concept of superconducting power lines commercially feasible  at least for high-load applications  it has been estimated that the waste would be halved using this method  since the necessary refrigeration equipment would consume about half the power saved by the elimination of the majority of resistive losses  some companies such as
and
have already begun commercial production of such systems  in one hypothetical future system called a   the cost of cooling would be eliminated by coupling the transmission line with a liquid hydrogen pipeline 
superconducting cables are particularly suited to high load density areas such as the business district of large cities  where purchase of an
for cables would be very costly

single wire earth return  
main article 
single-wire earth return  swer  or single wire ground return is a single-wire transmission line for supplying single-phase electrical power for an electrical grid to remote areas at low cost  it is principally used for rural electrification  but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps  single wire earth return is also used for hvdc over submarine power cables 
wireless power transmission  
main article 
both
and
attempted to devise systems for large scale wireless power transmission in the late 1800s and early 1900s  with no commercial success 
in november 2009  lasermotive won the nasa 2009 power beaming challenge by powering a cable climber 1km vertically using a ground-based laser transmitter  the system produced up to 1kw of power at the receiver end  in august 2010  nasa contracted with private companies to pursue the design of laser power beaming systems to power low earth orbit satellites and to launch rockets using laser power beams 
wireless power transmission has been studied for transmission of power from
to the earth  a high power array of
or laser transmitters would beam power to a   major engineering and economic challenges face any solar power satellite project
