fisheries management draws on
in order to find ways to protect
resources so
is possible  modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of appropriate management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules  which are put in place by a system of   according to the
 fao   there are  no clear and generally accepted definitions of fisheries management   however  the working definition used by the fao and much cited elsewhere is 
the integrated process of information gathering  analysis  planning  consultation  decision-making  allocation of resources and formulation and implementation  with enforcement as necessary  of regulations or rules which govern fisheries activities in order to ensure the continued productivity of the resources and the accomplishment of other fisheries objectives

history  
fisheries have been explicitly managed in some places for hundreds of years  more than 80 percent of the worlds commercial exploitation of fish and shellfish are harvest from natural occurring populations in the oceans and freshwater areas  for example  the   new zealand residents for about 700 years  had prohibitions against taking more than what could be eaten and about giving back the first fish caught as an offering to sea god   starting in the 18th century attempts were made to regulate fishing in the
fishery  this resulted in the enactment of a law in 1816 on the
fishery  which established in some measure what has come to be known as territorial use rights 
 the fishing banks were divided into areas belonging to the nearest fishing base on land and further subdivided into fields where the boats were allowed to fish  the allocation of the fishing fields was in the hands of local governing committees  usually headed by the owner of the onshore facilities which the fishermen had to rent for accommodation and for drying the fish  
governmental resource protection-based fisheries management is a relatively new idea  first developed for north european fisheries after the first
conference held in london in 1936  in 1957 british fisheries researchers
and
published a seminal work on
commercial fisheries dynamics  in the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for north european management schemes 
after some years away from the field of fisheries management  beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first world fisheries congress in athens in 1992   the dynamics of exploited fish populations  expressed his concerns  including the way his and sidney holt s work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years  nevertheless  the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid 
in 1996  the
was founded to set standards for   in 2010  the
was created to do the same for  
a report by   international sustainability unit  the new york-based
and 50in10 published in july 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding  270 billion a year to global gdp  but by full implementation of sustainable fishing  that figure could rise by an extra amount of as much as  50 billion 
political objectives  
according to the   fisheries management should be based explicitly on political objectives  ideally with transparent priorities  typical political objectives when exploiting a fish resource are to 
secure and increase employment
secure protein production and food supplies
increase export income
such political goals can also be a weak part of fisheries management  since the objectives can conflict with each other 
international objectives  
fisheries objectives need to be expressed in concrete management rules  in most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed  though non-binding  code of conduct for responsible fisheries  agreed at a meeting of the u n  s food and agriculture organization
session in 1995  the
it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum
  maximum fishing mortality rates  etc  in 2005 the
at the
comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world s major fishing nations against the code 
international agreements are required in order to regulate fisheries in international waters  the desire for agreement on this and other maritime issues led to three conferences on the law of the sea  and ultimately to the treaty known as the
 unclos   concepts such as
 eez  extending 200 nautical miles  370km  from a nation s coasts  allocate certain sovereign rights and responsibilities for resource management to individual countries 
other situations need additional intergovernmental coordination  for example  in the mediterranean sea and other relatively narrow bodies of water  eez of 200 nautical miles  370km  are irrelevant  international waters beyond 12-nautical-mile  22km  from shore require explicit agreements 
  which
through more than one eez also present challenges  here sovereign responsibility must be agreed with neighbouring
and fishing entities  usually this is done through the medium of a regional organisation set up for the purpose of
of that stock 
unclos does not prescribe precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed  several new fisheries  such as high seas
fisheries  are not  yet  subject to international agreement across their entire range  in november 2004 the
issued a resolution on fisheries that prepared for further development of international fisheries management law 
management mechanisms  
many countries have set up ministries government departments  named    or similar  controlling aspects of fisheries within their   four categories of management means have been devised  regulating either input investment  or output  and operating either directly or indirectly 
inputs
outputs
indirect
vessel licensing
catching techniques
direct
limited entry
and technical regulation
technical means may include 
prohibiting devices such as bows and arrows  and spears  or firearms
prohibiting nets
setting minimum mesh sizes
limiting the average potential catch of a vessel in the fleet  vessel and crew size  gear  electronic gear and other physical  inputs  
prohibiting bait
snagging
limits on fish traps
limiting the number of poles or lines per fisherman
restricting the number of simultaneous fishing vessels
limiting a vessel s average operational intensity per unit time at sea
limiting average time at sea
catch quotas  
main article 
systems that use individual transferable quotas  itq   also called individual fishing quota limit the total catch and allocate shares of that quota among the fishers who work that fishery  fishers can buy sell trade shares as they choose 
a large scale study in 2008 provided strong evidence that itq s can help to prevent fishery collapse and even restore fisheries that appear to be in decline  other studies have shown negative socio-economic consequences of itqs  especially on small-sclale fisheries  these consequences include concentration of quota in that hands of few fishers  increased number of inactive fishers leasing their quotas to others  a phenomenon known as armchair fishermen   and detrimental effects on coastal communities 
precautionary principle  
the fishery manager s guidebook issued in 2009 by the
of the united nations  advises that the precautionary approach or principle should be applied when  ecosystem resilience and human impact  including reversibility  are difficult to forecast and hard to distinguish from natural changes   130 the
suggests that when an action risks harm  it should not be proceeded with until it can be scientifically proven to be safe  historically fishery managers have applied this principle the other way round  fishing activities have not been curtailed until it has been proven that they have already damaged existing ecosystems  in a paper published in 2007  shertzer and prager suggested that there can be significant benefits to
and fishery yield if management is stricter and more prompt 
fisheries law  
main article 
is an emerging and specialized area of law which includes the study and analysis of different fisheries management approaches  including seafood safety regulations and aquaculture regulations  despite its importance  this area is rarely taught at law schools around the world  which leaves a vacuum of advocacy and research 
climate change  
main article 
in the past  changing
has affected inland and offshore fisheries and such changes are likely to continue  from a fisheries perspective  the specific driving factors of climate change include rising water temperature  alterations in the   changes in nutrient fluxes  and relocation of
and nursery habitat  further  changes in such factors would affect resources at all levels of biological organization  including the genetic  organism  population  and
levels 
population dynamics  
main article 
describes the growth and decline of a given fishery
over time  as controlled by birth  death and migration  it is the basis for understanding changing fishery patterns and issues such as habitat destruction  predation and optimal harvesting rates  the population dynamics of fisheries has been traditionally used by
to determine  
the basic accounting relation for population dynamics is the
model 
n1   n0   b  d   i  e
where n1 is the number of individuals at time 1  n0 is the number of individuals at time 0  b is the number of individuals born  d the number that died  i the number that immigrated  and e the number that emigrated between time 0 and time 1  while immigration and emigration can be present in   they are usually not measured 
care is needed when applying population dynamics to real world fisheries  in the past  over-simplistic modelling  such as ignoring the size  age and reproductive status of the fish  focusing solely on a single species  ignoring
and
to the ecosystem  has accelerated the collapse of key  
ecosystem based fisheries  

we propose that rebuilding ecosystems  and not sustainability per se  should be the goal of fishery management  sustainability is a deceptive goal because human harvesting of fish leads to a progressive simplification of ecosystems in favour of smaller  high turnover  lower trophic level fish species that are adapted to withstand disturbance and habitat degradation

according to
chris frid  the
points to pollution and global warming as the causes of unprecedentedly low fish stocks in recent years  writing   everybody would like to see the rebuilding of fish stocks and this can only be achieved if we understand all of the influences  human and natural  on fish dynamics  
has also had an effect  frid adds  fish communities can be altered in a number of ways  for example they can decrease if particular sized individuals of a species are targeted  as this affects   fishing  however  is not the sole perpetrator of changes to marine life -
is another example       no one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor  
in contrast to the traditional approach of focusing on a single species  the
is organized in terms of   ecosystem-based fishery concepts have been implemented in some regions  in 2007 a group of scientists offered the following ten commandments

keep a perspective that is holistic  risk-adverse and adaptive 
maintain an old growth structure in fish populations  since big  old and fat female fish have been shown to be the best spawners  but are also susceptible to overfishing 
characterize and maintain the natural spatial structure of fish stocks  so that management boundaries match natural boundaries in the sea 
monitor and maintain seafloor habitats to make sure fish have food and shelter 
maintain resilient ecosystems that are able to withstand occasional shocks 
identify and maintain critical food-web connections  including predators and forage species 
adapt to ecosystem changes through time  both short-term and on longer cycles of decades or centuries  including global climate change 
account for evolutionary changes caused by fishing  which tends to remove large  older fish 
include the actions of humans and their social and economic systems in all ecological equations 

report to congress  2009  
national marine fisheries service  noaa technical memorandum nmfs-f spo-96 
elderly maternal fish  
old fat female rockfish are the best producers
traditional management practices aim to reduce the number of old  slow-growing fish  leaving more room and resources for younger  faster-growing fish  most marine fish produce huge numbers of eggs  the assumption was that younger spawners would produce plenty of viable  
however  2005 research on
shows that large  elderly females are far more important than younger fish in maintaining productive fisheries  the larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster  survive starvation better  and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish  failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major us west coast fisheries  recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades  one way to prevent such collapses is to establish marine reserves  where fishing is not allowed and fish populations age naturally 
data quality  
according to fisheries scientist milo adkison  the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is the absence of quality data  fisheries management decisions are often based on population models  but the models need quality data to be effective  he asserts that scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data 
the most reliable source for summary statistics is the
fisheries department 
ecopath  
  with
 ewe   is an
modelling   it was initially a
initiative led by jeffrey polovina  later primarily developed at the
of the   in 2007  it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in noaas 200-year history  the citation states that ecopath  revolutionized scientists ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems   behind this lies two decades of development work by       and other   as of 2010 there are 6000 registered users in 155 countries  ecopath is widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems 
human factors  
managing fisheries is about managing people and businesses  and not about managing fish  fish populations are managed by regulating the actions of people  if fisheries management is to be successful  then associated human factors  such as the reactions of fishermen  are of key importance  and need to be understood 
management regulations must also consider the implications for stakeholders  commercial fishermen rely on catches to provide for their families just as farmers rely on crops  commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation  most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry  regulation changes can impact an entire towns economy  cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry 
performance  
the
of global
has been allowed to run down  this biomass is now diminished to the point where it is no longer possible to
catch the amount of fish that could be caught  according to a 2008 un report  titled   the world s
incur a   us 50 billion annual economic loss  through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management  the report  produced jointly by the
and the un
 fao   asserts that half the world s
could be scrapped with no change in catch 
 by improving governance of marine fisheries  society could capture a substantial part of this  50 billion annual economic loss  through comprehensive reform  the fisheries sector could become a basis for economic growth and the creation of alternative livelihoods in many countries  at the same time  a nations natural capital in the form of fish stocks could be greatly increased and the negative impacts of the fisheries on the marine environment reduced  
the most prominent failure of fisheries management in recent times has perhaps been the events that lead to the collapse of the   more recently  the
produced a series of journalistic investigations called   these detail investigations into the black market for   the subsidies propping up the spanish fishing industry  and the overfishing of the
