overview
location of chernobyl nuclear power plant
the abandoned city of
with chernobyl plant in the distance
the disaster began during a systems test on 26 april 1986 at reactor number four of the chernobyl plant  which is near
and in proximity to the administrative border with
and the
river  there was a sudden and unexpected power surge  and when an emergency shutdown was attempted  a much larger spike in power output occurred  which led to a
rupture and a series of steam explosions  these events exposed the
of the reactor to air  causing it to ignite    the resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive
into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area  including pripyat  the plumes drifted over large parts of the western
and europe  according to official post-soviet data  about 60  of the fallout landed in belarus 
36 hours after the accident soviet officials enacted a 10-kilometre
which resulted in the rapid evacuation of 49,000 people and their animals  primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor  the town of pripyat  although not communicated at the time  an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy
 hotspots  deposited on it  while up to around that point  the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction  permitting
to be the best safety measure to take for the town  before the winds began to change direction 
as the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated  the
was increased from 10 to 30km about one week after the accident  resulting in a further 68,000 evacuated  including from the
itself  the surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in 135,000  long-term evacuees  in total  accepting to be moved  the near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some 350,000 over the decades  1986 to 2000  from the most severely  contaminated  areas  is regarded as largely political in nature  with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government  which was most common   many thousands of these evacuees would have been  better off staying home  
has determined that the  people still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around chernobyl  have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the
areas than  if they were exposed to the
health risk in a large city such as nearby kiev  
russia  ukraine  and belarus have been burdened with the continuing and substantial
and monthly compensation costs  of the chernobyl accident  although certain initiatives are legitimate  as the director of the
noted  an industry has been built on this unfortunate event  with a vast interest in creating a false picture 
the rate of new construction builds for civilian fission-electric reactors dropped in the late 1980s  with the effects of accidents having a   the
was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the  
the accident raised the already heightened concerns about
worldwide  and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design  hundreds of disparate
proposals  including those under construction at chernobyl    were eventually cancelled  with the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new
standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly hostile anxious public opinion  there was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new  startups   after 1986 
the accident also raised concerns about the cavalier
in the soviet nuclear power industry  slowing industry growth and forcing the soviet government to become less secretive about its procedures  the government coverup of the chernobyl disaster was a  catalyst  for   which  paved the way for reforms leading to the soviet collapse  
cancer projections
a report by the
examines the environmental consequences of the accident  another
agency    has estimated a global
of radiation exposure from the accident  equivalent on average to 21 additional days of world exposure to natural    individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed  including 530,000 local recovery workers who averaged an
equivalent to an extra 50 years of typical natural background radiation exposure each  estimates of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously  disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify mortalitywhether the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide  and whether the deaths are immediate  short term  or long term 
are directly attributed to the accident  all among the reactor staff and emergency workers  an unscear report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at 64 as of 2008  the
predicts the eventual death toll could reach 4,000 among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation  200,000 emergency workers  116,000 evacuees and 270,000 residents of the most contaminated areas   this figure is a total
death toll prediction  combining the deaths of approximately 50 emergency workers who died soon after the accident from   nine children who have died of
and a future predicted total of 3940 deaths from radiation-induced cancer and leukaemia 
in a
paper in the
in 2006  the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of europe  but following a different conclusion methodology to the chernobyl forum study  which arrived at the total predicted death toll of 4,000 after
were factored in  they stated  without entering into a discussion on deaths  that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident 
the risk projections suggest that by now  2006  chernobyl may have caused about 1000 cases of thyroid cancer and 4000 cases of other cancers in europe  representing about 0.01  of all incident cancers since the accident  models predict that by 2065 about 16,000 cases of thyroid cancer and 25,000 cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident  whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes 
in terms of non peer-reviewed estimates  based on a simple
multiplication  that the  icrp  states  should not be done   two anti-nuclear advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation  the
estimates that  among the hundreds of millions of people exposed world-wide  excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual 50,000 excess cancer cases resulting in 25,000 excess cancer deaths 
along similar lines  the 2006   commissioned by the
political party  predicts an eventual 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths in total  around the globe 
the russian founder of that region s chapter of   authored a book titled   which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster  nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between 1986 and 2004 
itself advocates a figure of at least 200,000 or more  the book has failed the
process  of the five reviews published in the academic press  four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory  and one praised it while noting some shortcomings  the review by m  i  balonov published by the
concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader  it characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of
than science 
verifiable human deaths
the largest verifiable death toll that followed as a result of the chernobyl radioisotope releases is not a direct result of the radiation itself but instead was a result of the anxieties created by the media and some doctors  that capitalised on the varying levels of individual parental ignorance of the
at play  worldwide  an estimated excess of about 150,000
may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of
from chernobyl  according to dr robert baker and ultimately a 1987 article published by linda e  ketchum in the journal of nuclear medicine which mentions but does not reference an
source on the matter 
the available statistical data excludes the soviet ukraine belarus abortion rates  as they are presently unavailable  from the available data  an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human
in denmark occurred in the months following the accident  at a rate of about 400 cases  in greece  there was an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated  in italy  a  slightly  above the expected number of
occurred  approximately 100 
as the increase in radiation in denmark was so low   the public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands  caused  more
in denmark than the accident  this underlines the importance of public debate  the role of the mass media and of the way in which national health authorities participate in this debate 
no evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth  mutations  which might be associated with the accident are apparent in belarus or the ukraine  the two republics which had the highest exposure to   in sweden  and finland where no increase in abortion rates occurred  it was likewise determined that  no association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations  was found    a similar null increase in the abortion rate and a  healthy baseline situation  of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the hungarian congenital abnormality registry  findings also mirrored in austria  larger   mainly western european  data sets approaching a million births in the
database  divided into  exposed  and control groups were assessed in 1999  as no chernobyl impacts were detected  the researchers conclude  in retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified   despite studies from germany and turkey  the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects  in greece  denmark  italy etc   due to the anxieties created 
in   it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies  but unlike the dominant
model of radiation and cancer rate increases  it was known  by select researchers who were familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing  that the  malformation of organs appears to be a
with a   below which  no rate increase is observed  this
 birth defects  issue was discussed by frank castronovo of the
in 1999  publishing a detailed review of
and the available pregnancy data following the chernobyl accident  inclusive of data from  s two largest
hospitals  castronovo concludes that  the
with newspaper reporters playing up
stories of children with birth defects  is  together with dubious studies that show   the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that chernobyl increased the background rate of birth defects  when the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations  no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose 
accident
on 26 april 1986  at 01 23     reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase  leading to explosions in its core  this dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere 73 and caused an open-air fire  the fire increased the emission of   carried by the smoke  as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard   the accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety
feature  which took place during a normal shutdown procedure 
steam turbine tests
in steady state operation  a significant fraction  over 6   of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the
of its accumulated fission products  this heat continues for some time after the
is stopped  e g   following an emergency   and active cooling may be required to prevent  
reactors like those at chernobyl use water as a coolant  reactor 4 at chernobyl consisted of about 1,600 individual fuel channels  each required a coolant flow of 28 metric tons  28,000 litres or 7,400 us gallons  per hour 
since cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a scram  in the event of a power grid failure  chernobyl s reactors had three backup   these could start up in 15 seconds  but took 6075 seconds 15 to attain full speed and reach the 5.5  mw  output required to run one main pump  30
to solve this one-minute gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that
from the
 as it wound down under residual steam pressure  could be used to generate the required electrical power  analysis indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for 45 seconds  16 bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators 
this capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally  and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully  an initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the
voltage of the turbine-generator was insufficient  it did not maintain the desired
after the turbine trip  the system was modified  and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful  in 1985  the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results  the test procedure would be repeated again in 1986  and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of reactor four 
the test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor  the test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown  no detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated  so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor  nikiet  or the scientific manager  instead  it was approved only by the director of the plant  and even this approval was not consistent with established procedures  
according to the test parameters  the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than 700mw at the start of the experiment  if test conditions had been as planned  the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely  the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started  which was inconsistent with approved procedure 
the chernobyl power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first 6075 seconds of a total loss of electric power  and thus lacked an important safety feature  the station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity  which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose  and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the soviet nuclear oversight regulator  even though there was a representative at the complex of 4 reactors   1820
the experimental procedure was intended to run as follows 
the reactor was to be running at a low power level  between 700 mw and 800 mw 
the steam-turbine generator was to be run up to full speed 
when these conditions were achieved  the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off 
turbine generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically 
after the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage  the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down 
conditions before the accident
the conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of 25 april 1986  the day-shift workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures  a special team of
was present to test the new voltage regulating system  as planned  a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at 01 06 on 25 april  and the power level had reached 50  of its nominal 3200mw thermal level by the beginning of the day shift 
a schematic diagram of the reactor
at this point  another regional power station unexpectedly went offline  and the
controller requested that the further reduction of chernobyl s output be postponed  as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand  the chernobyl plant director agreed  and postponed the test  despite this delay  preparations for the test not affecting the reactor s power were carried out  including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or eccs  a passive active system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a   given the other events that unfolded  the system would have been of limited use  but its disabling as a  routine  step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test  in addition  had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned  it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test 
at 23 04  the kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume  this delay had some serious consequences  the day shift had long since departed  the evening shift was also preparing to leave  and the night shift would not take over until midnight  well into the job  according to plan  the test should have been finished during the day shift  and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shut-down plant  3638
the night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment  a further rapid decrease in the power level from 50  was executed during the shift change-over 
was chief of the night shift  and leonid toptunov was the operator responsible for the reactor s operational regimen  including the movement of the   toptunov was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months  3638
the test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor 4 to a thermal level of 7001000mw  an output of 700mw was reached at 00 05 on 26 april  due to the reactor s production of a fission byproduct    which is a reaction-inhibiting   core power continued to decrease without further operator actiona process known as   this continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation  xenon-135 is  burned off  as quickly as it is created from decaying
by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable   when the reactor power was lowered  previously produced high quantities of iodine-135 decayed into the neutron-absorbing xenon-135 faster than the reduced
could burn it off  as the reactor power output dropped further  to approximately 500mw  toptunov mistakenly inserted the control rods too farthe exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because akimov and toptunov both died in the hospital on 10 and 14 may respectively  this combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended near- state  with a power output of 30mw thermal or less 
the reactor was now producing 5percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test  73 control-room personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits  several minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at 160200mw  thermal   a much smaller value than the planned 700mw  the rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown  and the subsequent operation at a level of less than 200mw led to increased poisoning of the
by the accumulation of xenon-135  this restricted any further rise of reactor power  and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning 
the operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow  and possibly by instability of neutron flux  which triggered alarms  the control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the steam water separator drums  and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water  as well as from
opened to relieve excess steam into a   and from the neutron power controller  between 00 35 and 00 45  emergency alarm signals concerning
parameters were ignored  apparently to preserve the reactor power level 
when the power level of 200mw was achieved  preparation for the experiment continued  as part of the test plan  extra water pumps were activated at 01 05 on 26 april  increasing the water flow  the increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core  the coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers   which now more closely approached the
temperature of water  reducing the  
the flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01 19  triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators  at the same time  the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing
in the core and the steam separators  since water weakly absorbs neutrons  and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam   turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still  the crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow  in an effort to increase steam pressure  and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power 
all these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration  nearly all of the control rods were removed manually  including all but 18 of the  fail-safe  manually operated rods of the minimal 28 which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant  out of a total 211 control rods  while the emergency
system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually  through the  az-5  button   the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level  and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed  further  the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced  which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling  thereby reducing
by the water  the reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers  if anything pushed it into supercriticality  it was unable to recover automatically 
experiment and explosion
radioactive steam plumes continued to be generated days after the initial explosion  as evidenced here on 3 may 1986 due to   the roof of the turbine hall is damaged  image centre   roof of the adjacent reactor 3  image lower left  shows minor fire damage 
at 1 23 04a m   the experiment began  four of the main circulating pumps  mcp  were active  of the eight total  six are normally active during regular operation  the steam to the turbines was shut off  beginning a run-down of the turbine generator  the diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads  the generators were to have completely picked up the mcps  power needs by 01 23 43  in the interim  the power for the mcps was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down  as the
of the turbine generator decreased  so did the power it produced for the pumps  the water flow rate decreased  leading to increased formation of steam voids  bubbles  in the core 
because of the positive void coefficient of the rbmk reactor at low reactor power levels  it was now primed to embark on a
loop  in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water
to absorb neutrons  which in turn increased the reactor s power output  this caused yet more water to flash into steam  giving a further power increase  during almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback  inserting
into the reactor core to limit the power rise  this system had control of only 12 rods  and nearly all others had been manually retracted 
at 1 23 40  as recorded by the
centralized control system  an emergency shutdown  scram  of the reactor was initiated  the scram was started when the eps-5 button  also known as the az-5 button  of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed  this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them  including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier  the reason why the eps-5 button was pressed is not known  whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures  or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment 
there is a view that the scram may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase  although there is no recorded data proving this  some have suggested that the button was not pressed  and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system  the skala registered a manual scram signal  in spite of this  the question as to when or even whether the eps-5 button was pressed has been the subject of debate  there are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start  and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to self-destruct but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions  578
after the eps-5 button was pressed  the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began  the control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at 0.4m s  so that the rods took 18 to 20seconds to travel the full height of the   about 7 metres  a bigger problem was the design of the   which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn  those displacers had a 1.25 m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration  and lowering the rods displaced the neutron-absorbing water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite  as a result  the scram increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant  this behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another rbmk reactor at
in 1983 induced a power spike  but as the subsequent scram of that reactor was successful  the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance 
a few seconds after the start of the scram  a power spike occurred  and the core overheated  causing some of the
to fracture  blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion  with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core  within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530mw  31
the subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments  it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation  apparently  the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup  leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure  this caused the fuel cladding to fail  releasing the fuel elements into the coolant  and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located 
then  according to some estimations  the reactor jumped to around 30,000mw thermal  ten times the normal operational output  the last reading on the control panel was 33,000mw  it was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building  but a   like the explosion of a
from excess vapour pressure  appears to have been the next event  there is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor s exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing  tearing off and blasting the 2000-ton upper plate  to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened  through the roof of the reactor building  this is believed to be the first explosion that many heard  366 this explosion ruptured further fuel channels  as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber  and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core  the total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor s thermal power 
a second  more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first  this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the   this explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator  the ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air  greatly contributing to the spread of
and the
of outlying areas 
according to observers outside unit 4  burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor  some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire  about 25 percent of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected  parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building  as a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core  the air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire  32  
after the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage  one such survivor 
recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a  very beautiful  -like beam of
light  caused by the   that appeared to    
there were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion  one view was that the second explosion was caused by   which had been produced either by the overheated steam- reaction or by the
that produced hydrogen and   another hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of
caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core  a third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion  according to this version  the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop  causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure  that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam  this second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building 
the force of the second explosion  and the ratio of
released during the event  indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient  the result of the melting core material  in the absence of its cladding  water coolant and moderator  undergoing runaway
similar to the explosion of a   this nuclear excursion released 40billion
of energy  the equivalent of about ten tons of   the analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core 
contrary to safety regulations    a combustible material  had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall  ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor 3  which was still operating  it was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor 3  42 inside reactor 3  the chief of the night shift  yuri bagdasarov  wanted to shut down the reactor immediately  but chief engineer nikolai fomin would not allow this  the operators were given
and
tablets and told to continue working  at 05 00  bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor  leaving only those operators there who had to work the   44

extremely high levels of radioactivity in the lava under the chernobyl number four reactor in 1986
radiation levels
the radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6 per second  r s   equivalent to more than 20,000roentgens per hour  a lethal dose is around 500roentgens   5  over 5hours  so in some areas  unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute  however  a
capable of measuring up to 1000r s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building  and another one failed when turned on  all remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001r s and therefore read  off scale   thus  the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001r s  3.6r h   while the true levels were much higher in some areas  4250
because of the inaccurate low readings  the reactor crew chief alexander akimov assumed that the reactor was intact  the evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored  and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by 04 30 were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective  4250 akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning  sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor  none of them wore any protective gear  most  including akimov  died from radiation exposure within three weeks  24748
fire containment
firefighter   being decorated for bravery
shortly after the accident  firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires  first on the scene was a chernobyl power station firefighter brigade under the command of lieutenant   who died on 9 may 1986 of   they were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were  and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular    we didn t know it was the reactor  no one had told us  
grigorii khmel  the driver of one of the   later described what happened 
we arrived there at 10 or 15 minutes to two in the morning     we saw graphite scattered about  misha asked   is that graphite   i kicked it away  but one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up   it s hot   he said  the pieces of graphite were of different sizes  some big  some small  enough to pick them up   
we didn t know much about radiation  even those who worked there had no idea  there was no water left in the trucks  misha filled a
and we aimed the water at the top  then those boys who died went up to the roof  vashchik  kolya and others  and volodya pravik     they went up the ladder     and i never saw them again  54
anatoli zakharov  a fireman stationed in chernobyl since 1980  offers a different description in 2008 
i remember joking to the others   there must be an incredible amount of radiation here  we ll be lucky if we re all still alive in the morning  
he also said 
of course we knew  if we d followed regulations  we would never have gone near the reactor  but it was a moral obligation  our duty  we were like  
the immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing reactor no 4 to protect no 3 and keep its core cooling systems intact  the fires were extinguished by 5 00  but many firefighters received high doses of radiation  the fire inside reactor 4 continued to burn until 10 may 1986  it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out  73
the fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over 5000metric tons of sand  lead  clay  and
onto the burning reactor and injection of   the ukrainian filmmaker
captured film footage of an
helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby
cable  causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its four-man crew  it is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core 
from eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died  as reported on the
television series    one described his experience of the radiation as  tasting like metal   and feeling a sensation similar to that of
all over his face   this is similar to the description given by   a
physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a   
the explosion and fire threw hot particles of the
and also far more dangerous   radioactive isotopes such as    
and other   into the air  the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion 
equipment assembled included remote-controlled bulldozers and robot-carts that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris  valery legasov  first deputy director of the kurchatov institute of atomic energy in moscow  said  in 1987   but we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything  where there was very high radiation  the robot ceased to be a robotthe electronics quit working

announcement and evacuation
the view of chernobyl nuclear power plant taken from the city of pripyat
russian language announcement
problems playing this file  see  
the nearby city of pripyat was not immediately evacuated  the townspeople went about their usual business  completely oblivious to what had just happened  however  within a few hours of the explosion  dozens of people fell ill  later  they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths  along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting 
as the plant was run by authorities in moscow  the government of ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident    then chairman of the presidium of
of the ukrainian ssr  recalls that ukraine s acting
phoned her at work at 9am to report current affairs  only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the chernobyl nuclear power plant  but it was extinguished and everything was fine  when shevchenko asked  how are the people    he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about   some are celebrating a wedding  others are gardening  and others are fishing in the    shevchenko then spoke over the phone to  
of the central committee of the
and de facto head of state  who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the  
a commission was set up the same day  26 april  to investigate the accident  it was headed by   first deputy director of the kurchatov institute of atomic energy  and included leading nuclear specialist   hydro-meteorologist   radiologist
and others  they flew to
and arrived at the power plant in the evening of 26 april  by that time two people had already died and 52 were hospitalized  the delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure  in the early hours of 27 april  over 24 hours after the initial blast  they ordered the
of pripyat  initially it was decided to evacuate the population for three days  later this was made permanent 
by 11 00 on 27 april  buses had arrived in pripyat to start the evacuation  the evacuation began at 14 00  a translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows 
for the attention of the residents of pripyat  the city council informs you that due to the accident at chernobyl power station in the city of pripyat the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating  the communist party  its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this  nevertheless  with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible  the children being top priority  we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of kiev region  for these reasons  starting from april 27  1986 2pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal  supervised by the police and the city officials  it is highly advisable to take your documents  some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food  just in case  with you  the senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in pripyat to maintain these facilities in a good working order  all the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period  comrades  leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights  electrical equipment and water and shut the windows  please keep calm and orderly in the process of this short-term evacuation 
evacuation announcement in pripyat  27 april 1986  14 00 
to expedite the evacuation  residents were told to bring only what was necessary  and that it would only last approximately three days  as a result  most personal belongings were left behind  and remain there today  by 15 00  53,000 people were evacuated to various villages of the   the next day  talks began for evacuating people from the 10km zone  ten days after the accident  the evacuation area was expanded to 30km  19mi   115,1201 this
has remained ever since  although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded 
these evacuations actually had some economic benefit  moving people to areas of labour shortage in belarus and ukraine  90
evacuation began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the union  only on 28 april  after radiation levels set off alarms at the
in sweden  over 1,000 kilometres  620mi  from the chernobyl plant  did the soviet union publicly admit that an accident had occurred  at 21 02 that evening a 20-second announcement was read in the tv news programme  
there has been an accident at the chernobyl nuclear power plant  one of the nuclear reactors was damaged  the effects of the accident are being remedied  assistance has been provided for any affected people  an investigative commission has been set up 
  28 april 1986  21 00 
this was the entirety of the announcement of the accident  the
 tass  then discussed
and other american nuclear accidents  an example of the common soviet tactic of
when one occurred in the soviet union  the mention of a commission  however  indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident  and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music  which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy 
around the same time 
released its report about the disaster 
shevchenko was the first of the ukrainian state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on 28 april  there she spoke with members of medical staff and people  who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes  shevchenko returned home near midnight  stopping at a radiological checkpoint in vilcha  one of the first that were set up soon after the accident 
there was a notification from moscow that there was no reason to postpone the 1 may
celebrations in kiev  including the annual parade   but on 30 april a meeting of the political bureau of the central committee of cpu took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration  scientists were reporting that the radiological background in kiev city was normal  at the meeting  which was finished at 18 00  it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular 3.54 to under 2 hours 
several buildings in pripyat were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant  these included the
which closed in 1996 and the
which closed in 1998 
steam explosion risk
two floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe  the third floor above them  below the reactor  served as a steam tunnel  the steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water  after the disaster  the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water  and constituted a serious steam explosion risk 
chernobyl
flows formed by fuel-containing mass in the basement of the plant
the
graphite  fuel and other material above  at more than 1200c  started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining  creating   a radioactive semi-liquid material comparable to   if this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water  it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor  it became necessary to drain the pool 
the bubbler pool could be drained by opening its   however the valves controlling it were underwater  located in a flooded corridor in the basement  so volunteers in
and
 for protection against radioactive   and equipped with   entered the knee-deep radioactive water and managed to open the valves  these were the engineers alexei ananenko and valeri bezpalov  who knew where the valves were   accompanied by the shift supervisor boris baranov  upon succeeding and emerging from the water  according to many english language news articles  books and the prominent
surviving disaster - chernobyl nuclear  the three knew it was a suicide-mission and began suffering from
and died soon after  some sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant  however research by andrew leatherbarrow  author of the 2016 book chernobyl 01 23 40  determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration  alexei ananenko continues to work in the nuclear energy industry  and rebuffs the growth of the chernobyl media
surrounding him  while valeri bezpalov was found to still be alive by leatherbarrow  the elderly 65 year old baranov had lived until 2005 and died of heart failure 
once the bubbler pool gates were opened by the ananenko team  fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement  the operation was not completed until 8 may  after 20,000metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out 
with the bubbler pool gone  a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion  to do so  the molten core would now have to reach the
below the reactor  to reduce the likelihood of this  it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor  which would also stabilize the foundations  using   the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 may  it was estimated that 25metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at 100c  59 this idea was soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete 
it is likely that intense
the water  generating a low-
 h2o2  solution akin to an   conversion of bubbler pool water to h2o2 is confirmed by the presence in the chernobyl lavas of
and metastudtite  the only minerals that contain peroxide 
debris removal
chernobyl power plant in 2006 with the
the worst of the radioactive
was collected inside what was left of the reactor  much of it shoveled in by
wearing heavy protective gear  dubbed  bio-robots  by the military   these workers could only spend a maximum of 40seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris  the reactor itself was covered with bags of sand  lead and
dropped from helicopters  some 5000 metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident 
at the time there was still fear that the reactor could re-enter a self-sustaining nuclear chain-reaction and explode again  and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion  and to prevent further release of radioactive material  this was the largest civil engineering task in history  involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation  by december 1986  a large concrete
had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents  a unique  clean up  medal was given to the workers 
many of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the chernobyl area 
during the construction of the sarcophagus  a scientific team re-entered the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed  complex expedition   to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion  these scientists manually collected cold fuel rods  but great heat was still emanating from the core  rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes  the scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust 
after six months of investigation  in december 1986  they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of unit four  more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons  which they called  the elephant s foot  for its wrinkled appearance  the mass was composed of sand  glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor  the concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot  and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed   it was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion 
liquidators worked under deplorable conditions  poorly informed and with poor protections  many if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits  177183 2 some exceeded limits by over 100 timesleading to rapid death  187
the official contaminated zones became stage to a massive clean-up effort lasting seven months  177183 the official reason for such early  and dangerous  decontamination efforts  rather than allowing time for natural decay  was that the land must be re-peopled and brought back into cultivation  indeed  within fifteen months 75  of the land was under cultivation  even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled  defence forces must have done much of the work  yet this land was of marginal agricultural value  according to historian david marples  the administration had a psychological purpose for the clean-up  they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy  and even to restart the chernobyl power station  789,87,1923
causes
there were two official explanations of the accident 
operator error
the first official explanation of the accident  later acknowledged to be erroneous  was published in august 1986  it effectively placed the blame on the
operators  to investigate the causes of the accident the
created a group known as the
 insag   which in its report of 1986  insag-1  on the whole also supported this view  based on the data provided by the soviets and the oral statements of specialists  in this view  the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations   during preparation and testing of the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary load  personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise   311
the operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of
and   as well as lack of experience and training  according to these allegations  at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off  most notably the
 eccs   lar  local automatic control system   and az  emergency power reduction system   personnel had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor  and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion 
the developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis  namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures  thus the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff  312
in this analysis of the causes of the accident  deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually  serious critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident  the following general picture arose from these observations  several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible  one was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night 
the reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators  which the test was really about  the main process computer  skala  was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power  normally the reactor would have started to insert all of the   the computer would have also started the  emergency core protection system  that introduces 24 control rods into the active zone within 2.5 seconds  which is still slow by 1986 standards  all control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators 
on the subject of the disconnection of safety systems  valery legasov said  in 1987  that   i t was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight  
this view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the chernobyl accident that appeared immediately after the accident  and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications

ukraine has declassified a number of
documents from the period between 1971 and 1988 related to the chernobyl plant  mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant  such as splitting of concrete layers  that were never acted upon  they document over 29 emergency situations in the plant during this period  8 of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel 
in 1991 a commission of the ussr state committee for the supervision of safety in industry and nuclear power reassessed the causes and circumstances of the chernobyl accident and came to new insights and conclusions  based on it  in 1992 the iaea nuclear safety advisory group  insag  published an additional report  insag-7  which reviewed  that part of the insag-1 report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident   and was included the ussr state commission report as appendix i 
in this insag report  most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous  based on incorrect information obtained in august 1986  or less relevant  this report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident  presented in appendix i  according to this account  the operators  actions in turning off the emergency core cooling system  interfering with the settings on the protection equipment  and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude  although they may have been a breach of regulations  turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations 
human factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster  these included operating the reactor at a low power levelless than 700mwa level documented in the run-down test programme  and operating with a small
 orm   the 1986 assertions of soviet experts notwithstanding  regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level  18
however  regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity  yet  post-accident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the orm is reflected in the operating procedures and design documentation for the rbmk-1000 is extremely contradictory   and furthermore   orm was not treated as an operational safety limit  violation of which could lead to an accident   3425
according to the insag-7 report  the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor  there are two such reasons  18
the reactor had a dangerously large positive   the void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant  most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient  i e  the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant  since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases  fewer
are slowed down 
are less likely to split
atoms  so the reactor produces less power  a negative feedback   chernobyl s rbmk reactor  however  used solid
as a
to   and the water in it  on the contrary  acts like a harmful   thus neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water  furthermore  because steam
much less readily than water  increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms  increasing the reactor s power output  this makes the rbmk design very unstable at low power levels  and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level  this behaviour is   and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew 
a more significant flaw was in the design of the
that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction  in the rbmk reactor design  the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was 1.3 metres shorter than necessary  and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water  the upper part of the rod  the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction  was made of   with this design  when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position  the graphite parts initially displace some water  which absorbs neutrons  as mentioned above   effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially  thus for the first few seconds of control rod activation  reactor power output is increased  rather than reduced as desired  this behaviour is counter-intuitive and was not known to the reactor operators 
other deficiencies besides these were noted in the rbmk-1000 reactor design  as were its non-compliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety 
analysis of views
both views were heavily
by different groups  including the reactor s designers  power plant personnel  and the soviet and ukrainian governments  according to the iaea s 1986 analysis  the main cause of the accident was the operators  actions  but according to the iaea s 1993 revised analysis the main cause was the reactor s design  one reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the chernobyl accident was that the primary data covering the disaster  as registered by the instruments and sensors  were not completely published in the official sources 
once again  the
had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident  insag notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough  witness the length of time for which the eccs was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power  insag s view is that it was the operating crew s deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame   most reprehensibly  unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot  although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test   24
as in the previously released report insag-1  close attention is paid in report insag-7 to the inadequate  at the moment of the accident   culture of safety  at all levels  deficiency in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also  and to no lesser extent  during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants  including design  engineering  construction  manufacture  and regulation   the poor quality of operating procedures and instructions  and their conflicting character  put a heavy burden on the operating crew  including the chief engineer   the accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture  not only at the chernobyl plant  but throughout the soviet design  operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time   24

national and international spread of radioactive substances
four hundred times more radioactive material was released from chernobyl than by the
of   the disaster released 1/100 to 1/1000 of the total amount of radioactivity released by
during the 1950s and 1960s  approximately 100,000km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout  with the worst hit regions being in belarus  ukraine and russia  slighter levels of contamination were detected over all of europe except for the  
the initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from soviet sources  but from sweden  on the morning of 28 april workers at the forsmark nuclear power plant  approximately 1,100km  680mi  from the chernobyl site  were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes 
it was sweden s search for the source of radioactivity  after they had determined there was no leak at the swedish plant  that at noon on 28 april led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western soviet union  hence the evacuation of pripyat on 27 april  36 hours after the initial explosions  was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the soviet union  the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in   but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication

contamination from the chernobyl accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions  much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the   the
mountains and the   where
caused radioactive rainfall  the resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized  and water-flows across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas  sweden and norway also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front  bringing rain  4344  78
rain was purposely

radioactive release
like many
into the environment  the chernobyl release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core  particularly dangerous are the highly radioactive   those with high
rates that accumulate in the food chain  such as some of the isotopes of  
and   iodine-131 and caesium-137 are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population 
detailed reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in 1989 and 1995  with the latter report updated in 2002

have passed  is less than 1  of its initial magnitude  and it continues to reduce beyond 0.78  after 7 half-lives to 0.098  remaining after 10 half-lives have passed and so on   some radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive  which is not accounted for here   the release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their   and the majority of the
present in the core was retained in the reactor 
all of the   including

the chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the pripyat river  which feeds into the dnieper reservoir system  one of the largest surface water systems in europe  which at the time supplied water to kiev s 2.4 million residents  and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred  60 the radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident  in the most affected areas of ukraine  levels of radioactivity  particularly from radionuclides 131i  137cs and 90sr  in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident  though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom  in an insoluble phase  and would not dissolve for 8001000 years  64 guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to 3,700 l  allowing most water to be reported as safe  and a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the chernobyl plant s cooling pond was within acceptable norms  despite this  two months after the disaster the kiev water supply was abruptly switched from the dnieper to the desna river  645 meanwhile  massive silt traps were constructed  along with an enormous 30m-deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the pripyat river  6567

in belarus and the bryansk region of russia  concentrations in a number of fish species varied from 100 to 60,000bq kg during the period 199092  the contamination of fish caused short-term concern in parts of the uk and germany and in the long term  years rather than months  in the affected areas of ukraine  belarus  and russia as well as in parts of scandinavia 
groundwater
was not badly affected by the chernobyl accident since
with short half-lives decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies  and longer-lived radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were
to surface
before they could transfer to groundwater  however  significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from
sites in the 30km  19mi  exclusion zone around chernobyl  although there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites off-site  i e  out of the 30km  19mi  exclusion zone   the iaea chernobyl report argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of
of surface-deposited radioactivity

the norwegian agricultural authority reported that in 2009 a total of 18,000 livestock in norway needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter in order to ensure that their meat was safe for human consumption  this was due to residual radioactivity from chernobyl in the plants they graze on in the wild during the summer  1,914 sheep needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter during 2012  and these sheep were located in just 18 of norway s municipalities  a decrease of 17 from the 35 municipalities affected animals were located in during 2011  117 municipalities were affected during 1986  
the after-effects of chernobyl were expected to be seen for a further 100 years  although the severity of the effects would decline over that period  scientists report this is due to radioactive

of all 66,000 belarusian emergency workers  by the mid-1990s only 150  roughly 0.2   were reported by their government as having died  in contrast  5,722 casualties were reported among ukrainian clean-up workers up to the year 1995  by the national committee for radiation protection of the ukrainian population

health in belarus and ukraine has shown disturbing trends following the chernobyl disaster  in belarus  incidence of congenital defects had risen by 40  within six years of the accident  to the point that it became the principal cause of infant mortality  52   there was a substantial increase in digestive  circulatory  nervous  respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers  correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination  and in one especially contaminated district of belarus  95  of children were in 2005 reported to have at least one chronic illness  129  199   the ukrainian ministry of health estimated in 1993 that roughly 70  of its population were unwell  with large increases in respiratory  blood and nervous system diseases  27   by the year 2000  the number of ukrainians claiming to be radiation  sufferers   poterpili  and receiving state benefits had jumped to 3.5 million  or 5  of the population  many of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones  or former or current chernobyl plant workers  45 according to -affiliated scientific bodies  these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor health-care and nutrition  also  they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed  especially of cancer  are now being registered 
of the approximately 600,000  liquidators  that were engaged in the chernobyl clean-up  roughly 50,000 were required to work as  bio-robots   in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate  these bio-robots are well-known figures within every village  housing block and work-collective  most are prematurely aged and many have died  and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider population  910,31   according to ethnographer   adriana petryna  birth defects appear to have increased in ukraine as well  she describes gross deformities in the kyev city hospital s neonatal unit  including one infant born to a chernobyl worker  who had an extra finger  a deformed ear  his trachea missing and his gut external to his body  hospital staff were on the whole cooperative  but warned petryna that she would be forbidden to access any statistics  she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence  78 poor or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both belarus and ukraine  it has been observed that belarus in particular actively suppresses or ignores health-related research  45   a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves  512 one belarusian villager   describes   we had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral  we must have buried about fifty people that year  is it related to radiation  who knows   259  
under soviet rule  the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered up    most cases of
 ars  were disguised as vegetovascular dystonia  vvd   a soviet classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations  sweating  tremors  nausea  hypotension or hypertension  neurosis  spasms and seizures  symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of ars  declassified documents show that the soviet health ministry ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of ars as vvd  for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss  and for all  liquidators  who had exceeded their maximum allowable dose    it appears that up to 17,500 people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this manner  434   subsequent claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories  individual poor constitution  psychological self-induction   11 a key tool for soviet denial was the  35 rem concept   whereby it was held that 35 rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime   based on international standards   and since most people near chernobyl received less than that  their health complaints could be attributed to  radiophobia   47  
both belarus and ukraine rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster  for instance  in 2002 the world bank advised belarus to  shift its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing forward-looking activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people   health-related government welfare was blamed for creating  the sense of victimization and dependency  and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders  98,101 belarus in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific research  45   historian   david marples attributes this more to that government s weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs  512

the 2005 chernobyl forum report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the chernobyl accident  in that publication more than 4000 cases were reported  and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia  it said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected population  dr michael repacholi  manager of who s radiation program reported that the 4000 cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths 
according to unscear  up to the year 2005  an excess of over 6000 cases of thyroid cancer have been reported  that is  over the estimated pre-accident baseline thyroid cancer rate  more than 6000
cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident  a number that is expected to increase  they concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure

are generally treatable  and when treated the

 such as lung cancer  corroborating unscear s assessments  unscear does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects  pointing to a doubling of radiation-induced minisatellite
among children born in 1994  however  the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the chernobyl accident is still high according to published studies 
the german affiliate of the
 ippnw  argued that more than 10,000 people are today affected by thyroid cancer and 50,000 cases are expected in the future 
other health disorders
fred mettler  a radiation expert at the university of new mexico  puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at  perhaps  5000  for a total of 9000 chernobyl-associated fatal cancers  saying  the number is small  representing a few percent  relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer  but the numbers are large in absolute terms   the same report outlined studies based in data found in the russian registry from 1991 to 1998 that suggested that  of 61,000 russian workers exposed to an average dose of 107 msv about 5  of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure  
the report went into depth about the risks to
of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation  according to the iaea the  designation of the affected population as  victims  rather than  survivors  has led them to perceive themselves as helpless  weak and lacking control over their future   the iaea says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects 
fred mettler commented that 20 years later   the population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding  a number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex  to reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise   in addition  disadvantaged children around chernobyl suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the chernobyl accident  but also to the poor state of post-soviet health systems 
the
 unscear   part of the chernobyl forum  have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects  unscear was set up as a collaboration between various united nation bodies  including the   after the atomic bomb attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki  to assess the long-term effects of radiation on human health 
deaths due to radiation exposure
the number of potential deaths arising from the chernobyl disaster is heavily debated  the  s prediction of 4000 future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the
 lnt   which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the  
roy shore contends that estimating health effects in a population from the lnt model  is not wise because of the uncertainties  
radiation warning sign in pripyat
according to the union of concerned scientists the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide  including all contaminated areas  is approximately 27,000 based on the same lnt 
another study critical of the chernobyl forum report was commissioned by greenpeace  which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in belarus  russia and ukraine the accident could have resulted in 10,000200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004  the scientific secretary of the chernobyl forum criticized the report s reliance on non- locally produced studies  although most of the study s sources were from peer-reviewed journals  including many western medical journals  the higher mortality estimates were from non-peer-reviewed sources  while gregory hrtl  spokesman for the who  suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology 
chernobyl  consequences of the catastrophe for people and the environment is an english translation of the 2007 russian publication chernobyl  it was published in 2009 by the
in their annals of the new york academy of sciences  it presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between 1986  the year of the accident  and 2004 reflect 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released  though  it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received  knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled  and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former ussr is produced by radiation from chernobyl accident or by other social or behavioural factors  such as smoking or alcohol drinking 
the authors suggest that most of the deaths were in russia  belarus and ukraine  though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from chernobyl  the literature analysis draws on over 1000 published titles and over 5000 internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the chernobyl disaster  the authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading eastern european authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the iaea and unscear 
the estimated human health impacts were criticized by m  i  balonov of the institute of radiation hygiene  st  petersburg  russia who described them as biased  drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base  balanov s expressed his opinion that  the authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the russian-language publications  for example  to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions  
abortion requests
see also 
following the accident 
mistrusted many medical professionals  such as the spokesman from the uk    and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them  throughout the european continent  in nations where
is legal  many requests for induced abortions  of otherwise normal pregnancies  were obtained out of fears of radiation from chernobyl  including an excess number of abortions in denmark in the months following the accident  in greece  following the accident many
were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation  although it was determined that the
to
would not exceed 1  100   a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other non- effects  there was an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated  probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk  a  slightly  above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in italy 
speculation
according to   a professor of
and member of the
advisory committee  the  lnt philosophy is overly conservative  and low-level radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed   yoshihisa matsumoto  a radiation biologist at the tokyo institute of technology  cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which dna repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage  mossman suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a  prudent public health policy  
another significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the chernobyl accident  since 1991 large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care  on socio-economic stability  and the manner in which statistical data is collected  ronald chesser  a radiation biologist at   says that  the subsequent soviet collapse  scarce funding  imprecise dosimetry  and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

it is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster  according to   the soviet union spent 18 billion rubles  the equivalent of us 18 billion at that time  on containment and decontamination  virtually bankrupting itself  in belarus the total cost over 30 years is estimated at us 235billion  in 2005 dollars   on-going costs are well known  in their 20032005 report 
stated that between 5  and 7  of government spending in ukraine is still related to chernobyl  while in belarus over  13billion is thought to have been spent between 1991 and 2003  with 22  of national budget having been chernobyl-related in 1991  falling to 6  by 2002  much of the current cost relates to the payment of chernobyl-related social benefits to some 7million people across the 3 countries 
a significant economic impact at the time was the removal of 784,320ha  1,938,100 acres  of agricultural land and 694,200ha  1,715,000 acres  of forest from production  while much of this has been returned to use  agricultural production costs have risen due to the need for special cultivation techniques  fertilizers and additives 
politically  the accident gave great significance to the new soviet policy of glasnost  and helped forge closer sovietus relations at the end of the cold war  through bioscientific cooperation  4448 the disaster also became a key factor in the union s eventual   and a major influence in shaping the new   2021
both ukraine and belarus  in their first months of independence  lowered legal radiation thresholds from the soviet union s previous  elevated thresholds  from 35 rems per lifetime under the ussr to 7 rems per lifetime in ukraine and 0.1 rems per year in belarus   467,119124 this required an expansion of territories that were considered contaminated  in ukraine  over 500,000 people have now been resettled  many of whom have become applicants for medical and other welfare  ukraine also maintains the destroyed reactor  for which it employs a very large workforce in order to keep individual exposure times low  many of these workers have since registered disabilities and enrolled for welfare  in ukraine  the chernobyl disaster was an icon of the nationalist movement  symbolic of all that was wrong with the soviet union  and welfare became a key platform for winning independence  ukraine has since developed a massive and burdensome welfare system that has become increasingly corrupt and ineffective  it has presented its greatly increased welfare demands since 1991 as a demonstration of its own moral legitimacy  and as an argument for needing foreign aid  24 belarus  on the other hand  was politically weak when it gained independence  and looked to moscow for guidance  in many ways it has returned to the old soviet policy of secrecy and denial  467,119124 2224
aftermath
following the accident  questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate  all work on the unfinished reactors 5 and 6 was halted three years later  however  the trouble at the chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in
4  the damaged reactor was sealed off and 200 cubic meters  260cuyd  of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings    the work was managed by   the deputy chief engineer of installation and construction directorate  90  the ukrainian government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country 
decommissioning
main article 
in october 1991  a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor 2  the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair  and it was taken offline  reactor 1 was decommissioned in november 1996 as part of a deal between the ukrainian government and international organizations such as the iaea to end operations at the plant  on 15 december 2000  then-president
personally turned off reactor 3 in an official ceremony  shutting down the entire site

containment of the reactor
the chernobyl reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus  which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant 
a
was to have been built by the end of 2005  however  it has suffered ongoing delays and as of 2010  when construction finally began  was expected to be completed in 2013  this was delayed again to 2016  the end of the 30-year lifespan of the sarcophagus  the structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails  it is to be a metal arch 105 metres  344ft  high and spanning 257 metres  843ft   to cover both unit 4 and the hastily built 1986 structure  the   set up in 1997  has received 810 million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work  it and the nuclear safety account  also applied to chernobyl decommissioning  are managed by the
 ebrd    
by 2002  roughly 15,000 ukrainian workers were still working within the zone of exclusion  maintaining the plant and performing other containment- and research-related tasks  often in dangerous conditions  2 a handful of ukrainian scientists work inside the sarcophagus  but outsiders are rarely granted access  in 2006 an
team led by reporter richard carleton and producer stephen rice were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for 15 minutes and film inside the control room 
on 12 february 2013  a 600m2  6,500sqft  section of the roof of the turbine-building  adjacent to the sarcophagus  collapsed  at first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it  however the amount of snow was not exceptional  and the report of a ukrainian fact-finding panel concluded that the part collapse of the turbine-building was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure  the report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the turbine-building added a larger strain on the total structure than expected  and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding  experts such as valentin kupny  former deputy director of the nuclear plant  did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse  leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition  a proposed reinforcement in 2005 was cancelled by a superior official  after the 12 february incident  radioactivity levels were up to 19 becquerels per cubic meter of air  12 times normal  the report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed  all 225 workers employed by the chernobyl complex and the french company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse  according to the managers of the complex  radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels  between 5 and 6sv h  and should not affect workers  health  according to kupny the situation was underestimated by the chernobyl nuclear complex managers  and information was kept secret 
radioactive materials and waste management
as of 2006  some fuel remained in the reactors at units 1 through 3  most of it in each unit s   as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond  isf-1  
in 1999 a contract was signed for construction of a
management facility to store 25,000 used fuel assemblies from units 13 and other operational wastes  as well as material from decommissioning units 13  which will be the first rbmk units decommissioned anywhere   the contract included a processing facility able to cut the rbmk fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters  which were to be filled with
and
shut 
the canisters were to be transported to   where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to 100 years  this facility  treating 2500 fuel assemblies per year  would be the first of its kind for rbmk fuel  however  after a significant part of the storage structures had been built  technical deficiencies in the concept emerged  and the contract was terminated in 2007  the interim spent fuel storage facility  isf-2  will now be completed by others by mid-2013   
another contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant  to handle some 35,000 cubic meters of low- and intermediate-level liquid wastes at the site  this will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on site   
in january 2008  the ukrainian government announced a 4-stage decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site  
lava-like fuel-containing materials  fcms 
main article 
according to official estimates  about 95  of the fuel in reactor 4 at the time of the accident  about 180   remains inside the shelter  with a total radioactivity of nearly 18 million
 670   the radioactive material consists of core fragments  dust  and lava-like  fuel containing materials   fcm also called   that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a
form 
three different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building  black  brown  and a
ceramic  the lava materials are
with
of other materials within them  the porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly 
it is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity  from 1997 to 2002 a series of published papers suggested that the self-irradiation of the lava would convert all 1,200metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks  but it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid  the same paper states that the loss of
from the wrecked reactor is only 10kg  22lb  per year  this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment  the paper also states that when the shelter is improved  the leaching rate of the lava will decrease 
some of the surfaces of the lava flows have started to show new uranium minerals such as
 na
4 uo
2  co
3 
3  and   however  the level of radioactivity is such that during 100 years  the lava s self irradiation  701620000000000000021016 decays per gram and 2 to 70055000000000000005105gy of  or   will fall short of the level required to greatly change the properties of
 1018  decays per gram and 108 to 109gy of  or    also the lava s rate of dissolution in water is very low  107gcm2day1   suggesting that the lava is unlikely to dissolve in water

entrance to the
around chernobyl
an area originally extending 30 kilometres  19mi  in all directions from the plant is officially called the  zone of alienation   it is largely uninhabited  except for about 300 residents who have refused to leave  the area has largely reverted to forest  and has been overrun by wildlife because of a lack of competition with humans for space and resources  even today  radiation levels are so high that the workers responsible for rebuilding the sarcophagus are only allowed to work five hours a day for one month before taking 15 days of rest  ukrainian officials estimated the area would not be safe for human life again for another 20,000 years  although by 2016  187 local ukrainians had returned and were living permanently in the zone  
in 2011 ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the chernobyl reactor to tourists who wish to learn more about the tragedy that occurred in 1986 
forest fires

recovery projects
the chernobyl shelter fund
main articles 
and
the chernobyl shelter fund was established in 1997 at the denver
to finance the shelter implementation plan  sip   the plan calls for transforming the site into an ecologically safe condition by means of stabilization of the sarcophagus followed by construction of a new safe confinement  nsc   while the original cost estimate for the sip was us 768million  the 2006 estimate was  1.2billion  the sip is being managed by a consortium of     and   and conceptual design for the nsc consists of a movable arch  constructed away from the shelter to avoid high radiation  to be slid over the sarcophagus  the nsc is expected to be completed in 2015  and will be the largest movable structure ever built

the united nations development programme
the
has launched in 2003 a specific project called the
 crdp  for the recovery of the affected areas  the programme was initiated in february 2002 based on the recommendations in the report on human consequences of the chernobyl nuclear accident  the main goal of the crdp s activities is supporting the
in mitigating long-term social  economic  and ecological consequences of the chernobyl catastrophe  crdp works in the four most chernobyl-affected areas in ukraine     
and  
the international project on the health effects of the chernobyl accident
the international project on the health effects of the chernobyl accident  ipehca  was created and received 20million  mainly from japan  in hopes of discovering the main cause of health problems due to 131i radiation  these funds were divided between ukraine  belarus  and russia  the three main affected countries  for further investigation of health effects  as there was significant corruption in former soviet countries  most of the foreign aid was given to russia  and no positive outcome from this money has been demonstrated   
chernobyl children international
 cci  is a -accredited    international development  medical  and humanitarian organization that works with children  families and communities that continue to be affected by the   the organization s founder and chief executive is   the irish humanitarian and peace campaigner  the cci was founded in 1991 in response to an appeal from
and
doctors for aid  roche then began organizing  rest and recuperation  holidays for a few chernobyl children  recruiting irish families who would welcome and care for them  cci expanded into the
in 2001 
over its lifetime  the organization has grown in strength and numbers  it works closely with the belarusian government  the   and many thousands of volunteers worldwide to deliver a broad range of supports to the children and the wider community  it also acts as an advocate for the rights of those affected by the chernobyl explosion  and engages in research and outreach activities to encourage the rest of the world to remember the victims and understand the long-term impact on their lives

cultural impact
main articles 
and
the chernobyl accident attracted a great deal of interest  because of the distrust that many people  both within and outside the   had in the
authorities  a great deal of debate about the situation at the site occurred in the
during the early days of the event  because of defective
based on   it was thought that unit number three had also suffered a dire accident   
journalists mistrusted many professionals  such as the spokesman from the uk    and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them 
in italy  the chernobyl accident was reflected in the outcome of the   as a result of that referendum  italy began phasing out its nuclear power plants in 1988  a decision that was effectively   a
reiterated italians  strong objections to nuclear power  thus abrogating the government s decision of 2008 
in germany  the chernobyl accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry  after several states had already created such a post  the minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well  which the current minister still holds as of 2015  the events are also credited with strengthening the anti-nuclear power movement  which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power that was made by the 19982005 schrder government

notes
although most reports on the chernobyl accident refer to a number of graphite fires  it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned  according to the
website      it is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of
and coal  numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn high-purity  nuclear-grade graphites   on chernobyl  the same source states   graphite played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident  the red glow observed during the chernobyl accident was the expected color of
for graphite at 700c and not a large-scale graphite fire  as some have incorrectly assumed   similarly  nuclear physicist yevgeny velikhov    noted some
after the accident that  until now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist  a great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an
state  that is  all the nuclear- that was generated inside the uranium fuel   was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it  to glow   this is contrary to the oft cited interpretation  which is that the graphite was red-hot chiefly because it was chemically
with the air

explanatory notes
 no one believed the first newspaper reports  which patently understated the scale of the catastrophe and often contradicted one another  the confidence of readers was re-established only after the press was allowed to examine the events in detail without the original censorship restrictions  the policy of openness    and  uncompromising criticism  of outmoded arrangements had been proclaimed at the 27th congress  of    but it was only in the tragic days following the chernobyl disaster that glasnost began to change from an official slogan into an everyday practice  the truth about chernobyl that eventually hit the newspapers opened the way to a more truthful examination of other social problems  more and more articles were written about drug abuse  crime  corruption and the mistakes of leaders of various ranks  a wave of  bad news  swept over the readers in 198687  shaking the consciousness of society  many were horrified to find out about the numerous calamities of which they had previously had no idea  it often seemed to people that there were many more outrages in the epoch of
than before although  in fact  they had simply not been informed about them previously   -kagarlitsky pp  333334
 the mere fact that the operators were carrying out an experiment that had not been approved by higher officials indicates that something was wrong with the chain of command  the state committee on safety in the atomic power industry is permanently represented at the chernobyl station  yet the engineers and experts in that office were not informed about the program  in part  the tragedy was the product of administrative anarchy or the attempt to keep everything secret   medvedev  z   pp  1820

- pp  85-86  pp  92-93 in  radiation  what it is  what you need to know  by robert peter gale  m d   ph d  and eric lax  publisher  alfred a  knopf  new york  2013    the correct number of chernobyl-related cancers will never be known  in part because of the considerable uncertainties in estimating cancers and cancer deaths  especially problematic is the controversy about whether very low doses of radiation  especially if given over a prolonged interval  increase cancer risk  there are other difficulties as well  for one  we do not know precisely what radiation dose most people received  people who were indoors when the radioactive plume passed received much less radiation than those who were outdoors  however  because most people did not know when the radioactive plume passed  they cannot accurately reconstruct their whereabouts at that time  also  many people were evacuated from contaminated land at different times and thus received very different doses from ground and food contamination  next we have the geopolitical reality that many of the exposed people no longer live in the chernobyl area  living elsewhere  even in other countries  they are   the chernobyl accident was relatively quickly followed by the dissolution of the soviet union  whereupon many people s lifestyles but perhaps not their lives changed  mostly for the worse  for example  cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption increased  resulting in a profound drop in life expectancy  both activities are correlated with increased cancer risk independent of radiation exposure  sorting out any changes in cancer incidence or prevalence will be difficult at best     fourth  high-quality cancer registries were absent before and even after the accident  making it impossible to know with certainty the background rate of most cancers before the accident
