overview  
sustainability branding is the process of creating and maintaining an identity of a specific product  service  or business that reflects special added value in terms of environmental and social benefits  a brand is only perceived as being sustainable if it can credibly convey sustainability benefits which are noticeable by and relevant to the consumer  a sustainability brand must have an integrated culture for success  the key to a sustainable brand is trust between the consumer and the brand  only when this is achieved can a sustainable brand truly generate a usp and reap the benefits of it 
opposed to the term green brands which mainly focuses on environmentally sound business practices  sustainability brands additionally acknowledge the social dimension of providing products and services  this entails  among others  health and safety issues resulting from direct or indirect product use  consumption level  as well as the conditions under which a particular product is produced  production level   the
of people at work  i e  employees as well as workers within the supply chains  are important indicators of sustainability brands and sustainability marketing in general which adheres to the triple bottom line of ecological  environmental   social  equity   and financial  economic  sustainability 
a brand is able to evoke positive or negative feelings  especially in the context of sensitive social and ecological issues  the more positive the perceptions and feelings are towards a brand  the higher will be the likelihood of identification and   it is therefore crucial in sustainability marketing to build up strong brands  in doing so  companies face far-reaching decisions in the areas of brand positioning  1   sustainability brand name selection  2   and sustainability brand development  3   in order to create and build sustainability brands that consumers associate with social and environmental added value 
claims on products and packages need to be made  and read  with caution  ambiguous
titles such as green product  green packaging and environmentally friendly can be confusing without specific definition  some regulators  such as the us federal trade commission  are providing guidance
sustainability brands vs  sustainable brands  
since the adjective sustainable might convey the notion of brands that have long-lasting success  implicating durable competitive advantage without any particular reference to a sustainability agenda  the term sustainability brand should be used to prevent ambiguity  albeit subtle difference  the latter explicitly emphasizes the notion of brands which have built their brand image upon sustainable business practices that consumers value  sustainability brands are commonly referred to in the field of sustainability marketing 
sustainability brand positioning and the 8 c s  
sustainability brand positioning and positioning in general is part of the brand identity and
that is to be actively communicated to the target audience and can be described as an iterative process  consisting of deliberate and proactive actions aimed at the definition of distinct consumer perceptions  sustainable brand positioning is the brand positioning of sustainable products and services  sustainable products and services should offer an improved social and ecological performance during the whole product lifecycle and at the same time they have to satisfy consumer needs and wants  many of the first generation sustainability brands failed in the market because companies overemphasized the positive socio-ecological product attributes  while they neglected to focus on other product attributes such as performance  functionality or design  too  as a result  many products could not compete against conventional products 
to build up and position strong sustainability brands  there are some guidelines to follow  marc stoiber
summed them up in the the five cs of sustainability branding  consumer facing  competitive  core  conversational and credible  perrine bouhana added to that concept a sixth c  consistency  martin belz complemented and revised this concept to 8 cs of sustainability branding and describes them as followed 
core
sustainability should be tied up to the key problems and the core business through assessing the socio-ecological impacts of products along the entire life-cycle of the products and finding out the socio-ecological hot-spots of the product-life-cycle 
co-operative
the solutions to the main socio-ecological problems associated with products along the entire
require - both in the process of innovating and marketing sustainable products and services - co-operations with suppliers  retailers  consumers  scientists  and other non-market actors  e g  ngos  
credible
fundamentals of credibility are first the solving of key socio-ecological problems associated with companies products and second tying sustainability to the core business  co-operations with trustworthy partners and the use of independent  third-party labels  e g  labels like bio or msc  such as a high level of transparency  e g  through an online tracking system  which enables consumers to see the world of behind the product  can additionally increase the credibility of sustainability brands 
consumer benefits
socio-ecological characteristics or attributes of products usually just play an auxiliary role  no core benefits   to broaden the appeal of sustainability brands  the companies should emphasize the inherent consumer benefits of socio-ecological attributes  including efficiency and cost effectiveness  health and safety  symbolism and status  further they should align socio-ecological attributes with benefits such as functionality  design  and durability to create motive alliances 
conversational
sustainability branding is more effective as a two-way conversation  rather than a one-way announcement  inviting consumers to enter into dialogues about the sustainability process strengthens the brand-consumer relationship 
consistency
if sustainability is key to brand positioning  this requires a kind of integrated approach to sustainability communication  it is important to communicate in a consistent way  including e g  advertising  personal selling or online communication  in addition to that  the sustainability product brand has to be consistent with the overall environmental and social performance of the company 
commitment
sustainability branding not only requires the commitment of the pr department and the sustainability officers but also requires the commitment of top management and marketing decision makers 
continuity
sustainability must reflect the core values of the brand and contribute to delivering the brand promise over the long term  this means that a brand cannot change its sustainability focus too often  or engage in too many non-related areas 
sustainability brand name selection  
in the course of choosing the right name  sustainability brands must first just like brand names in the conventional sense- follow well-established rules  in general  a good brand name should consider three areas  memorability  distinctive short name  evoking emotions   strategic fit  they should relate to the actual product  ability to expand to other brands  and legal  legal protection under trade mark law etc  
sustainability brands  however  go one step further and incorporate something that conveys the notion of social and or ecological awareness 
a popular example is better place  a global provider of electric vehicle networks and services that works in a joint venture with renault nissan alliance motor company to promote the use of electric cars  the founder  shai agassi  was intrigued by a question posed at the world economic forum in 2005  how do you make the world a better place by 2020    thus the name better place  it is not related to the product  electric vehicle  but to much wider social and ecological issues  depletion of natural resources  co2 emissions   which the company addresses or rather offers the solution for 
sustainability brand names can be part of a new product launch  an extension to an existing  conventional  brand or be so new to the market that they create a product category themselves  each of these approaches has specific strategic implications 
enter established market
entering a saturated market such as the one for conventional household detergents with a sustainability brand might prove extremely difficult  however  there are companies that have successfully entered the market and positioned their brand as sustainability leaders  seventh generation  for instance  is the us market leader in four product categories  household  laundry  personal and baby care  with products that in the words of the company- protect human health and the environment 
brand extension   aligning existing brand
established brands can leverage their existing brand recognition to extend their name to new products  which are then marketed as socially and ecologically friendly  tide  a popular detergent brand in the us  expanded its brand to meet the demands of the ecological conscious consumer by launching tide cold water detergent in 2005  the product requires only cold water and thus saves energy  in 2010  it was given the green gh seal  which is only awarded after a cradle to grave examination of the product 
creating entirely new product categories
sustainability brand names can also succeed if they achieve to create a product category for themselves where there is virtually no competition yet  when the car-sharing concept was fairly new  companies such as mobility carsharing in switzerland did neither compete with car companies nor public transportation providers 
sustainability brand development  
sustainability brand development
sustainability brands are subject to constant change  a sustainability brand that is well established on the market  can be further developed into different directions  according to belz and peattie
four main options for development are possible 
line extension occurs when a company adds new products of the same product category under the same sustainability brand name 
sustainability brand extension occurs when a company introduces products of a different product category but under the same sustainability brand name 
multi-sustainability brands occur when a company manages two or more different sustainability brands but in the same product category 
new sustainability brands occur when a company creates an entire new brand name when they access a new product category  for example  
to create a sustainability brand it is furthermore important to adopt the right channels for marketing according to lauterborns five cs  advertising in this case can help to create awareness of the brand and thus form the new brand experience  furthermore  it is obligatory for sustainability brands to obtain one ore more   leading to a higher influence on consumer behaviour and the perception of the brand
