a
in cruise flight  aircraft like this burn  
aircraft must consume fuel to supply the energy needed to move the vehicles and their passengers 
is a measure of how much fuel an aircraft needs to operate  and can be expressed in several ways  for example by the liters of fuel consumed per passenger per kilometer  aerodynamic   which exerts a force on the aircraft in the opposite direction from the velocity  is a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft because they operate at such high speeds

factors in aircraft fuel economy  
each model of aircraft has a maximum range speed for a given total load  fuel plus payload   which is the speed at which it is most fuel efficient  flying slower or faster than this optimum speed increases fuel consumption per mile flown  there is an optimum speed for efficiency because the component of drag resulting from airframe skin friction against the air increases at a square function of air speed  but the drag resulting from generating lift decreases with air speed   these are technically called parasitic drag and induced drag  respectively   the desirability of a low maximum range speed to reduce
is at odds in aircraft design with the benefit from the revenue generated by making the design speed higher thereby increasing the passenger miles flown per day 
aircraft weight is also a factor in fuel economy  because more lift-generating drag  induced drag  results as weight increases  if the airframe weight is reduced  engines that are smaller and lighter can be used  and for a given range the fuel capacity can be reduced  thus some weight savings can be compounded for an increase in fuel efficiency  a rule-of-thumb being that a 1  weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75  reduction in fuel consumption 
flight altitude affects engine efficiency  jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the tropopause  the temperature minimum of the atmosphere  at lower temperatures  the engine efficiency is higher  1  jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds  but above about mach 0.85 the aerodynamic drag on the airframe overwhelms this effect 
above that speed  shockwaves begin to form that greatly increase drag  for supersonic flight  mach 1.0 or higher   fuel consumption is increased tremendously 
changes in commercial aircraft fuel economy since the 1950s  
although modern jet aircraft have twice the fuel efficiency of the earliest  
they are only slightly more fuel efficient than the latest piston engine airliners of the late 1950s such as the
and   nonetheless  jets have about twice the cruise speed  the early jet airliners were designed at a time when air crew labor costs were higher relative to fuel costs than today  despite the high fuel consumption  because fuel was inexpensive in that era the higher speed resulted in favorable economical returns since crew costs and amortization of capital investment in the aircraft could be spread over more seat miles flown per day 
today s turboprop airliners have better fuel efficiency than current jet airliners  in part because of their lower cruising speed and
that are more efficient than those of the 1950s-era piston-powered airlines  among major airlines  those with turboprop equipped regional carrier subsidiaries typically rank high in overall fleet fuel efficiency  for example  although
scored at the top of a 2011-2012 fuel efficiency ranking  if its regional carrierturbo-prop equipped were dropped from the consideration  the airline s ranking would be lower 
jet aircraft efficiency  
jet aircraft efficiency is improving  between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55  overall fuel efficiency gain  if one were to consider the
as the base case   most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use  between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4  
the
managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon  which is 16.7 l 100km per passenger  similar to a business jet  but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft 
states a fuel rate consumption of their
at less than 3 l 100km per passenger  78 passenger-miles per us gallon   however this is for an unspecified number and configuration of seats  the maximum configuration is 850 economy passengers  but with a typical 525-seat multi-class configuration the fuel consumption is  comparable to that of a b747-400 er and even about 15  worse than a b777-300er on a passenger-mile basis  
weight effect  
as over 80  of the fully laden take-off weight of a modern aircraft such as the
is craft and fuel    there remains considerable room for future improvements in fuel efficiency  the weight of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as  
and other composite plastics  expensive materials may be used  if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency  the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction  reduce the amount of fuel an aircraft must carry  this further reduces the mass of the aircraft  and therefore provides further gains in fuel efficiency  for example  the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials  the
was the first major commercial airplane to have a composite fuselage  composite wings  and use composites in most other airframe components 
very long non-stop flights suffer from the weight penalty of the large quantity of fuel required  limiting the number of available seats to compensate  for such flights  the critical fiscal factor is the quantity of fuel burnt per seat-nautical mile  for these reasons the world s longest commercial flights were cancelled circa 2013  an example is singapore air s former new york to singapore flight  which could carry only 100 passengers  all business class  on the 10,300 mile flight  according to an industry analyst   it  was  pretty much a fuel tanker in the air

airbus has showcased
 sharklets or winglets  that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption  there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380  further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption  winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing  can be retrofitted to any airplane  and smooths out the wing-tip vortex  reducing the aircraft s wing drag 
nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500lb  230kg     aircraft  this design provides greater fuel efficiency  since the whole craft produces lift  not just the wings  the blended wing body  bwb  concept offers advantages in structural  aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today s more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs  these features translate into greater range  fuel economy  reliability and life cycle savings  as well as lower manufacturing costs  nasa has created a cruise efficient stol  cestol  concept 
fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research  ifam  have researched a
skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a   aircraft is a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium

fuel consumption factors  
to save fuel  simon weselby presented the following measures while flying  in his example of an a330 flying 4,600 kilometres  2,900mi  
direct routing  40km  25mi  less distance saves 190kg  420lb  fuel
vertical flight profile optimization  fly 600m  2,000ft  below optimum altitude  600kg  1,300lb  more fuel consumed
cruising speed  0.01 mach above optimum  800kg  1,800lb  more fuel consumed
aircraft weight  1,000kg  2,200lb  more fuel on board  150kg  330lb  more fuel consumed  100 litres  22impgal  26usgal  of unused potable water  15kg  33lb  more fuel consumed 
also operational procedures can save fuel 
10 minutes less
use  35kg  77lb  fuel saved
reduced flap approach  15kg  33lb  fuel saved
reduced thrust reversal  30kg  66lb  fuel saved
maintenance saves fuel as well 
no engine wash schedule  100kg  220lb  more fuel consumed
slat rigging  5mm  0.20in  gap  50kg  110lb  more fuel consumed
spoiler rigging  10mm  0.39in  gap  40kg  88lb  more fuel consumed
damaged door seal  15kg  33lb  more fuel consumed
propellers versus jets  
are a more fuel efficient technology than
or   but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450mph  700km h   this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today  however  the decrease in speed reduces drag  with the current    high price for
and the emphasis on engine airframe efficiency to reduce emissions  there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the
and xwb  for instance  airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans  nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project  atp   where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds 
for private aircraft in   the current record is 37km kg fuel or 3.7 l 100km in a  
related to fuel efficiency is the  
range  
for very   the airplane is heavier to transport additional fuel  leading to a higher fuel consumption  above a certain distance  it becomes more fuel efficient to make a halfway stop to refuel even if it leads to an additional less efficient
and   for example  for a -300 the tipping point is at 3,000 nautical miles  5,600km   it is more fuel efficient to make a
below this distance and to make a stop above 
-224 fuel burn per distance against range
airline fuel efficiency  
fuel economy in
comes from aircraft fuel efficiency combined with
efficiency   
and   for instance  over the
route  the most active intercontinental market  in 2014 the average fuel consumption was 32 pax-km per l - 3.13 litres per 100 kilometres  75mpg-us  per passenger  the most fuel efficient airline was
with 40 pax-km l - 2.5 litres per 100 kilometres  94mpg-us  per passenger  thanks to its fuel efficient -8  a high 86  passenger load factor and a high density of 1.18 seat m due to a low 11  premium seating  on the other side  the least efficient was
at 27 pax-km l - 3.7 litres per 100 kilometres  64mpg-us  per passenger  using fuel inefficient
with a low density of 0.79 seat m due to a high 24  premium seating  in spite of a high 83  load factor 
research projects such as boeing s
program have sought to identify ways of improving the fuel economy of commercial aircraft operations  the u s  government has encouraged such research through grant programs  including the faa s continuous lower energy  emissions and noise  cleen  program  and nasa s environmentally responsible aviation  era  project
