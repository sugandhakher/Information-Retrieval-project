a 2012 map of the world showing in red the places with least water security 
security has been defined as  the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health  livelihoods and production  coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks   sustainable development will not be achieved without a water secure world  a water secure world integrates a concern for the intrinsic value of water with a concern for its use for human survival and well-being  a water secure world harnesses water s productive power and minimises its destructive force  water security also means addressing environmental protection and the negative effects of poor management  it is also concerned with ending fragmented responsibility for water and integrating water resources management across all sectors  finance  planning  agriculture  energy  tourism  industry  education and health  a water secure world   advances education  and increases living standards  it is a world where there is an improved quality of life for all  especially for the most vulnerableusually women and childrenwho benefit most from good water governance

background  
according to the
 while regional impacts will vary  global
will potentially alter agricultural productivity  freshwater availability and quality  access to vital minerals  coastal and island flooding  and more  among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships  realignment of energy markets and regional economies  and threats to security  
it impacts regions  states and countries  tensions exist between upstream and downstream users of water within individual jurisdictions 
during history there has been much conflict over use of water from
such as the
and
rivers  another highly politicized example is
control of water resources in the
region since its creation  where israel securing its water resources was one of several drivers for the 1967  
water security is sometimes sought by implementing  
between sources and users  water licences with different security levels and  
water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of market-based pricing for either water licenses or actual water 
fresh water  
water  in absolute terms  is not in short supply planet-wide  but  according to the united nations water organization  un-water  the total usable freshwater supply for ecosystems and humans is only about 200,000 km3 of water  less than one percent   1   of all freshwater resources  and  water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase in the last century  specifically  water withdrawals are predicted to increase by 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries  and 18 per cent in developed countries  by 2025  1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity  and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions

according to
 2010   about 80  of the world s population  5.6 billion in 2011  live in areas with threats to water security  the water security is a shared threat to human and nature and it is pandemic  human water-management strategies can be detrimental to wildlife  such as migrating fish  regions with intensive agriculture and dense populations  such as the us and europe  have a high threat of water security  water is increasingly being used as a weapon in conflict  water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty  war and conflict  low womens development and environmental degradation  researchers estimate that during 2010-2015  ca us 800 billion will be required to cover the annual global investment in   good management of water resources can jointly manage
protection and human water security  preserving flood plains rather than constructing flood-control reservoirs would provide a cost-effective way to control floods while protecting the biodiversity of wildlife that occupies such areas 
lawrence smith  the president of the population institute  asserts that although an overwhelming majority of the planet s surface is composed of water  97  of this water is constituted of saltwater  the
used to sustain humans is only 3  of the total amount of water on earth  therefore  smith believes that the competition for water in an overpopulated world would pose a major threat to human stability  even going so far as to postulate apocalyptic world wars being fought over the control of thinning ice sheets and nearly desiccated reservoirs  nevertheless  2 billion people have supposedly gained access to a safe water source since 1990 who may have earlier lacked it  the proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 percent in 1970 to 71 percent in 1990  79 percent in 2000 and 84 percent in 2004  parallel with rising population  this trend is projected to continue

are a good source of usable water  but the amount of energy needed to convert
to
is prohibitive with conventional approaches  explaining why only a very small fraction of the world s water supply is derived from   however  modern technologies  such as the   use solar energy to desalinate seawater for agriculture and drinking uses in an extremely cost-effective manner

india  
main articles      and
in india  there is competition for water resources of all inter state rivers except the main
among the riparian states of india and also with neighbouring countries which are nepal  china  pakistan  bhutan  bangladesh  etc  vast area of the
is under tropical climate which is conducive for agriculture due to favourable warm and sunny conditions provided perennial water supply is available to cater to the high rate of
from the cultivated land  though the overall water resources are adequate to meet all the requirements of the subcontinent  the water supply gaps due to temporal and spatial distribution of water resources among the states and countries in the subcontinent are to be bridged 
there is
available in the inter state rivers such as                   etc  among the riparian states of india in the absence of water augmentation from the water surplus rivers such as brahmaputra 
tributaries of
and west flowing coastal rivers of   all river basins face severe water shortage even for drinking needs of people  cattle and wild life during the intense summer season when the rainfall is negligible 
water security can be achieved along with
as it is going to consume electricity to link the surplus water areas with the water deficit areas by lift canals  pipe lines  etc  the total water resources going waste to the sea are nearly 1200 billion cubic meters after sparing moderate environmental  
water requirements of all rivers 
of the subcontinent is possible to achieve water security in the indian subcontinent with the active cooperation of the countries in the region

conventional fossil or nuclear energy based desalination  
due to record low rainfall in summer 2005  the reservoir behind
runs low  the reservoir supplies water to     japan 
as new technological innovations continue to reduce the capital cost of   more countries are building desalination plants as a small element in addressing their water crises 
desalinizes water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter
desalinizes water for 49 cents per cubic meter
and also treats sewage with
for industrial and potable use    
china and india  the world s two most populous countries  are turning to desalination to provide a small part of their water needs
in 2007 pakistan announced plans to use desalination
all australian capital cities  except
and   are either in the process of building desalination plants  or are already using them  in late 2011 
will begin using australia s largest desalination plant  the
to raise low reservoir levels 
in 2007
signed a contract to purchase a desalination plant
the largest desalination plant in the
is the one at     which began desalinizing 25 million gallons  95000 m  of water per day in december 2007  in the united states  the cost of desalination is  3.06 for 1,000 gallons  or 81 cents per cubic meter  in the united states        and florida use desalination for a very small part of their water supply 
after being desalinized at     water is pumped 200 miles  320km  inland though a pipeline to the capital city of  
a january 17  2008  article in the
states   world-wide  13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day  according to the international desalination association  
the world s largest desalination plant is the
desalination plant  phase 2  in the   it is a dual-purpose facility that uses multi-stage flash distillation and is capable of producing 300 million cubic meters of water per year 
a typical
in the u s  military uses nuclear power to desalinize 400,000 us gallons  1,500,000l  of water per day 
while desalinizing 1,000 us gallons  3,800l  of water can cost as much as  3  the same amount of
costs  7,945 
however  given the energy intensive nature of desalination  with associated economic and environmental costs  desalination is generally considered a last resort after   but this is changing as prices continue to fall 
according to   a report by lux research estimated that the worldwide desalinated water supply will triple between 2008 and 2020 
however  not everyone is convinced that desalination is or will be economically viable or environmentally sustainable for the foreseeable future    the former mayor of   has been a frequent critic of desalination proposals ever since she was appointed as a member of the california desalination task force  cook claims that in addition to being energy intensive  desalination schemes are very costlyoften much more costly than desalination proponents claim  in her writing on the subject  cook points to a long list of projects that have stalled or been aborted for financial or other reasons  and suggests that water-stressed regions would do better to focus on conservation or other water supply solutions than to invest in desalination plants 
solar energy based desalination  
a novel approach to desalination is the
which takes seawater and uses solar energy to desalinate it in conjunction with growing food crops in a specially adapted greenhouse
