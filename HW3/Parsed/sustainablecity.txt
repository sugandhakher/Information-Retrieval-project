a sustainable city  or eco-city  also  ecocity   is a city designed with consideration of   inhabited by people dedicated to minimization of required inputs of energy  water and food  and waste output of heat 
-     and water pollution  richard register first coined the term  ecocity  in his 1987 book  ecocity berkeley  building cities for a healthy future  other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are
  who later founded the company ecopolis pty ltd  and authors
and   who have written extensively on the subject  the field of
is sometimes used in planning these cities 
there remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included  generally  developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs  the ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable 
ideally  a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of ecology  economics  politics and culture  however  minimally a sustainable city should firstly be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding countryside  secondly  it should be able to power itself with renewable sources of energy  the crux of this is to create the smallest possible   and to produce the lowest quantity of
possible  to efficiently use land  compost used materials  recycle it or convert   and thus the city s overall contribution to
will be minimal  if such practices are adhered to 
it is estimated that over 50  of the worlds population now lives in cities and urban areas  these large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for
developers  and there are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities  humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections  because of this  a shift to more dense  urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper 
contrary to common belief  urban systems can be more environmentally sustainable than rural or suburban living  with people and resource located so close to one another it is possible to save energy for transportation and mass transit systems  and resources such as food  finally  cities benefit the economy by locating human capital in one relatively small geographic area where ideas can be generated

practical achievement  
these ecological cities are achieved through various means  such as 
different
such as agricultural plots within the city   or    this reduces the distance food has to travel from   practical work out of this may be done by either small scale private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture  e g    
sources  such as     or
created from   cities provide
that make such energy sources viable 
various methods to reduce the need for
 a massive energy demand   such as planting trees and lightening surface colors    an increase in water features  and green spaces equaling at least 20  of the city s surface  these measures counter the    caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt  which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areasas much as six degrees celsius during the evening 
improved
and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions  this requires a radically different approach to city planning  with integrated business  industrial  and residential zones  roads may be designed to make driving difficult 
optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of  
solutions to decrease   by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace    since the workplace tends to be in the city  downtown  or urban center  they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas    one of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the
movement   
or suds
- garden and landscape design for water conservation
- development and operational management tool providing guidance and m v for city administrators 
architecture  
buildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability  a commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning  building  and restructuring 
eco-industrial park  
the purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance  the community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues  such as energy  water  and materials  the components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems  more efficient use of energy  and more efficient material and water flows industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts  which can be accomplished through plant design  landscaping  and choice of materials  for instance  there is an industrial park in michigan built by phoenix designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials  the landscaping of the building will include native trees  grasses  and flowers  and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility  in choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park  designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another  steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area  and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power  in terms of material flows  the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities  a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another  or anchoring the park around resource recovery companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch  to create more efficient water flows in industrial parks  the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff 
urban farming  
urban farming is the process of growing and distributing food  as well as raising animals  in and around a city or in urban area  according to the ruaf foundation  urban farming is different from rural agriculture because  it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system  urban agriculture is embedded in -and interacting with- the urban ecosystem  such linkages include the use of urban residents as labourers  use of typical urban resources  like organic waste as compost and urban wastewater for irrigation   direct links with urban consumers  direct impacts on urban ecology  positive and negative   being part of the urban food system  competing for land with other urban functions  being influenced by urban policies and plans  etc   there are many motivations behind urban agriculture  but in the context of creating a sustainable city  this method of food cultivation saves energy in food transportation and saves costs  in order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth  cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms  as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system   read more on the

urban infill  
many cities are currently in a shift from the suburban sprawl model of development to a return to urban dense living  this shift in geographic distribution of population leads to a denser core of city residents  these residents provide a growing demand in many sectors that is reflected in the architectural fabric of the city  this new demand can be supplied by new construction or historic rehabilitation  sustainable cities will opt for historical rehabilitation wherever possible  having people live in higher densities not only gives economies of scale but also allows for infrastructure to be more efficient 
walkable urbanism  
walkable urbanism is a development strategy in opposition to suburban sprawl  it advocates housing for a diverse population  a full mix of uses  walkable streets  positive public space  integrated civic and commercial centers  transit orientation and accessible open space  it also advocates for density and accessibility of commercial and government activity 
new urbanism  
the most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the charter of   it is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities which support   residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles  and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures  compared with those living in
suburbs  the concept of
has also been introduced in europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl 
in
the recent movement of
promotes a sustainable approach towards construction  that appreciates and develops   walkability 
and   this in contrast to
and
architecture  as well as opposing solitary
and   both trends started in the 1980s

main article 
leed  or leadership in energy and environmental design  is an internationally recognized green building certification system  leed recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including  sustainable sites  water efficiency  energy and atmosphere  materials and resources  indoor environmental quality  locations   linkages  awareness and education  innovation in design  regional priority  in order for a building to become leed certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design  construction  and use  one example of sustainable design would be including a
like bamboo  bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested  by far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance  this promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency 
transportation  
as major focus of the sustainable cities  sustainable transportation attempts to reduce a citys reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly urban planning  low environmental impact vehicles  and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and social equity 
due to the significant impact that transportation services have on a citys energy consumption  the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts  currently  transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the worlds energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission  in order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas  sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers 
the
states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning  modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport  and making existing transport modes more efficient 
car free city  
the concept of
or a city with large
is often part of the design of a sustainable city  a large part of the
of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city 
emphasis on proximity  
created by eco friendly urban planning  the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems  this requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit  this reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking 
transportation in downtown  
furthermore  close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time  this in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating a part of their commute time

and
diversity in modes of transportation  
sustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of fuel-efficient transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand  due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy  this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices 
among the different modes of transportation  the use alternative energy cars and widespread instillation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance  while the creation of centralized bike and walking paths remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement 
access to transportation  
in order to maintain the aspect of social responsibility inherent within the concept of sustainable cities  implementing sustainable transportation must include access to transportation by all levels of society  due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents  completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation 
in order to make public transportation more accessible  the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city  as studies have shown  this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents  by allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation  it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live  this in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime  drug use  and violence 
urban strategic planning  
although there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards  there is an organization  the united cities and local governments uclg  that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines  the uclg a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in africa  asia  eurasia  europe  latin america  north america  middle east  west asian and a metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society  the 60 members of the uclg committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate theses experiences to make the best recommendations  additionally  the uclg accounts for differences in regional and national context  all the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet  and in conferences and workshops  an international conference is going to be held in italy at universit del salento and universit degli studi della basilicata called green urbanism from 1214 october 2016 
development  
recently  local and national governments and regional bodies such as the european union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of urban planning  this is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses  generally  in terms of urban planning  the responsibility of local governments are limited to land use and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies  the advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aides local governments in establishing performance based-management  clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level  and finally it improves institutional responses and local decision making  additionally  it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions  establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government  it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of the city and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing  energy and mobility 
obstacles  
the city development strategies  cds  has evolved to address new challenges and to provide space for innovative polices that involves all stakeholders  the inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with recent concerns of poverty reduction and climate change are new factors in achieving global sustainable cities  according to the uclg there are differences between regional and national conditions  framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments  communities and the private sector to continual to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions  building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment 
social factors of sustainable cities  
according to the un habitat  around half of the worlds population is concentrated in cities  which is set to rise to 60  within a couple decades  the uclg has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities  demographic change and migration  globalisation of the job market  poverty and unmet millennium development goals  segregation  spatial patterns and urban growth  metropolisation and the rise of urban regions  more political power for local authories  new actors for developing a city and providing services  decline in public funding for development  the environment and climate change  new and accessible building technologies  preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships

in adelaide  south australia  a city of 1.3 million people  premier mike rann  2002 to 2011  launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area  the projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects  thousands of adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days  sites include parks  reserves  transport corridors  schools  water courses and coastline  only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity  premier rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable  improve air and water quality and reduce adelaide s greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of c02 a year  he said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss 
solar power
the rann government also launched an initiative for adelaide to lead australia in the take-up of solar power  in addition to australia s first  feed-in  tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs  the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum  art gallery  parliament  adelaide airport  200 schools and australia s biggest rooftop array on the roof of adelaide showgrounds  convention hall which was registered as a power station 
wind power
south australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power making up 26  of its electricity generation by october 2011  in 5 years to 2011 there was a 15  drop in emissions  despite strong economic growth 
waste recycling
for adelaide the south australian government also embraced a zero waste recycling strategy  achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80  by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling  on a per capita basis this was the best result in australia  the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of c02 entering the atmosphere  in the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced  consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle can container they return to recycling  in 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the rann government preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream  in 2010 zero waste sa was commended by a un habitat report entitled  solid waste management in the world cities
