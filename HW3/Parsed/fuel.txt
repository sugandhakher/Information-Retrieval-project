was one of the first fuels to be used by humans and is still the primary energy source in much of the world  
a fuel is any material that can be made to
with other substances so that it releases
or
as
or to be used for   the concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing
but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as
 via
or   
the heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into
via a   other times the heat itself is valued for warmth    or industrial processes  as well as the illumination that comes with combustion  fuels are also used in the
of
in a process known as   where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy 
and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans  but other substances  including radioactive metals  are also utilized 
fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy  such as those that directly release
 such as
and   or
 such as   springs  compressed air  or water in a reservoir

history  
the first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by
near 2,000,000  two million  years ago    throughout most of human history fuels derived from plants or animal fat were only used by humans     a wood derivative  has been used since at least 6,000 bce for melting metals  it was only supplanted by   derived from coal  as european forests started to become depleted around the 18th century  charcoal briquettes are now commonly used as a fuel for
cooking 
coal was first used as a fuel around 1000 bce in china  with the energy in the form of
that could be released through   but the concept development of the
in the united kingdom in 1769  coal came into more common use as a power source  coal was later used to drive ships and   by the 19th century  gas extracted from coal was being used for street lighting in   in the 20th and 21st centuries  the primary use of coal is to generate   providing 40  of the world s electrical power supply in 2005 
fossil fuels were rapidly adopted during the industrial revolution  because they were more concentrated and flexible than traditional energy sources  such as water power  they have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society  with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power 
currently the trend has been towards renewable fuels  such as
like alcohols 
chemical  
chemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them  most notably by the process of   most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel  but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen 
chemical fuels are divided in two ways  first  by their physical properties  as a solid  liquid or gas  secondly  on the basis of their occurrence  primary  natural fuel  and secondary  artificial fuel   thus  a general classification of chemical fuels is

solid fuel  
main article 
coal is an important solid fuel
solid fuel refers to various types of
material that are used as fuel to produce
and provide   usually released through   solid fuels include
 see            and pellets made from wood  see       
and other  
technology also uses solid fuel  see    solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to   coal was the fuel source which enabled the   from firing   to running   wood was also extensively used to run   both peat and coal are still used in
today  the use of some solid fuels  e g  coal  is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas  due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions  the use of other solid fuels such as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves  in some areas 
is often the only solid fuel used  in ireland  peat
are used as smokeless fuel  they are also used to start a coal fire 
liquid fuels

liquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create   usually producing   they also must take the shape of their container  it is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid 
most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the
of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth s crust  however  there are several types  such as hydrogen fuel  for
uses   ethanol  jet fuel and biodiesel which are all categorized as a liquid fuel 
of oil-in-water such as
have been developed a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels  many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy 
some common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport  and can be handled with relative ease  also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications  and home use  fuels like kerosene are rationed in some countries  for example available in government subsidized shops in india for home use 
conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum  kerosene is used in
and as a fuel for cooking  heating  and small engines    composed chiefly of   can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures  regardless of pressure   which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications 
is a mixture of
and   both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions  it offers many of the advantages of
 cng   but is denser than air  does not burn as cleanly  and is much more easily compressed  commonly used for cooking and space heating  lp gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles  propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally

biofuels  
main article 
can be broadly defined as solid  liquid  or gas fuel consisting of  or derived from   biomass can also be used directly for heating or powerknown as biomass fuel  biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e g  plants  many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture 
perhaps the earliest fuel employed by humans is wood  evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at   south africa  it is unknown which hominid species first used fire  as both
and an early species of
were present at the sites  as a fuel  wood has remained in use up until the present day  although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources  wood has an

recently biofuels have been developed for use in automotive transport  for example
and    but there is widespread public debate about how carbon efficient these fuels are 
fossil fuels  
main article 
extraction of petroleum
fossil fuels are   primarily
and
  or    formed from the
of ancient plants and animals by exposure to high heat and pressure in the absence of oxygen in the  s
over hundreds of millions of years  commonly  the term fossil fuel also includes hydrocarbon-containing
that are not derived entirely from biological sources  such as   these latter sources are properly known as mineral fuels 
fossil fuels contain high percentages of
and include     and   they range from
materials with low   ratios like   to liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon  like
coal  methane can be found in
fields  alone  associated with oil  or in the form of   fossil fuels formed from the
of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth s crust over millions of years  this
was first introduced by german scholar
in 1556 and later by
in the 18th century 
it was estimated by the
that in 2007 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0   coal 27.4   natural gas 23.0   amounting to an 86.4  share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world  non-fossil sources in 2006 included
6.3  
8.5   and others              amounting to 0.9   world energy consumption was growing about 2.3  per year 
fossil fuels are
because they take millions of years to form  and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made  so we must conserve these fuels and use them judiciously  the production and use of fossil fuels raise environmental concerns  a global movement toward the generation of
is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs  the burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion
 21.3   of
 co2  per year  but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount  so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year  one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide   carbon dioxide is one of the
that enhances
and contributes to   causing the
of the earth to rise in response  which
agree will cause major   fuels are a source of energy 
energy  
the amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the stoichiometric ratio  the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel  and its   the energy per unit mass

nuclear fuel is any material that is consumed to derive   technically speaking  all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy      but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress  nuclear fuel is a material that can be  burned  by

most nuclear fuels contain heavy
elements that are capable of nuclear fission  when these fuels are struck by neutrons  they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart  this makes possible a self-sustaining

fusion  
fuels that produce energy by the process of
are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for   fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as
which will combine easily  energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma  and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge  this process is called fusion and it can give out energy 
in stars that undergo nuclear fusion  fuel consists of

or   in most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen  which can combine to form
through the
or by the   when the hydrogen fuel is exhausted  nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements  although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy  once
or
nuclei are produced  no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies  the elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused  therefore  fusion stops and the star dies  in attempts by humans  fusion is only carried out with hydrogen  isotope of 2 and 3  to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy  electric confinement      heating by laser  and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used
