municipal solid
 msw   commonly known as trash or garbage in the
and as refuse or rubbish in   is a
consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public   garbage  can also refer specifically to   as in a   the two are sometimes collected separately

composition  
the composition of municipal solid waste varies greatly from municipality to municipality  country to country  and changes significantly with time  in municipalities  countries  which have a well developed waste recycling system  the waste stream consists mainly of intractable wastes such as plastic film  and unrecyclable packaging materials  at the start of the 20th century  the majority of domestic waste  53   in the uk consisted of
from open fires  in developed municipalities  countries  without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes food wastes  market wastes  yard wastes  plastic containers and product packaging materials  and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential  commercial  institutional  and industrial sources  most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include   agricultural wastes    radioactive waste or   waste collection is performed by the
within a given area  the term residual waste relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for reprocessing  waste can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification 
     
 most can be recycled although some difficult to compost plant material may be excluded  
materials                    certain           etc 
waste       
electrical and
 weee  -           screens        etc 
composite wastes  waste   tetra packs  waste plastics such as toys
including most           electrical appliances      and
including     and
  expired   etc 
components of solid waste management  
bins to collect      
and incinerable waste 
the municipal solid waste industry has four components        and
via incineration  there is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams  therefore the   federal agency of the   developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste  the
is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness  source reduction and reuse  recycling or composting  energy recovery  treatment and disposal 
collection  
the functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials  but also the transport of these materials  after collection  to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied  this location may be a materials processing facility  a transfer station or a landfill disposal site 
waste handling and separation  storage and processing at the source  
waste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection  handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection  separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source 
segregation and processing and transformation of solid wastes  
the types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside   kerbside  in the uk  collection  drop-off and buy-back centers  the separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility  transfer stations  combustion facilities and disposal sites 
transfer and transport  
this element involves two main steps  first  the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment  the waste is then transported  usually over long distances  to a processing or disposal site 
disposal  
mixed municipal waste   
today  the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes  whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site  residual materials from
 mrfs   residue from the combustion of solid waste    or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities  a modern sanitary landfill is not a dump  it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety  such as the problems of insects and the contamination of  
reusing  
in the recent years environmental organizations  such as
or   have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks  these networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away  for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle  therefore  this free internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the  
landfills  
landfills are created by land dumping  land dumping methods vary  most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area  usually a hole or sidehill  after the waste is dumped  it is then compacted by large machines  when the dumping cell is full  it is then  sealed  with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt  this is the primary method of dumping in the united states because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in north america  landfills pose the threat of pollution  and can intoxicate ground water  the signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence  usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris  large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant 
energy generation  
municipal solid waste can be used to generate energy  several technologies have been developed that make the processing of msw for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before  including landfill gas capture  combustion      and   while older waste incineration plants emitted high levels of pollutants  recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern 
 epa  regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the
have succeeded in reducing emissions of
from
facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels  while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent  the epa noted these improvements in 2003  citing waste-to-energy as a power source  with less environmental impact than almost any other source of
