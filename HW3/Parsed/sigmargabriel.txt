  foreign minister mohammad
and
  the trip irritated

proposal for regional power-capacity markets  according to which utilities are paid for providing backup electricity at times when power generated by   such as the sun and wind  cannot supply the grid  a free market backstopped by an emergency reserve will be cheaper and work just as well as capacity markets  gabriel told   he later warned against a hasty exit from coal-fired power generation  concerned that such a move could pile more pressure on producers still wrestling with the planned shutdown of nuclear plants by 2022

and grant him clemency  amplifying germanys political voice in a region in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past  he had been urged by mps and human rights organizations to take up badawi s case before his trip  his outspoken criticism of saudi justice was unusual for western leaders visiting the country  a close ally for the west in fighting terrorism and   particularly given germanys status as   while the
