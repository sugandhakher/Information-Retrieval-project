forest
are probably the world s oldest form of
and most resilient   they originated in
along -clad river banks and in the wet foothills of
regions  in the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment  useful
and
species were identified  protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated  eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the gardens 
forest gardens are still common in the
and known by various names such as  home gardens in
in      
and   kandyan forest gardens in   huertos familiares  the  family orchards  of   and pekarangan  the gardens of  complete design   in   these are also called agroforests and  where the wood components are short-statured  the term
garden is employed  forest gardens have been shown to be a significant source of income and food security for local populations 
robert hart adapted forest gardening for the  s temperate climate during the 1980s  his theories were later developed by
from the
and various permaculturalists such as graham bell    dave jacke and

americas  
the bbc s
claimed that the   rather than being a pristine   has been shaped by humans for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and   this was also explored in the bestselling book 1491 by author   since the 1970s  numerous

system  in many countries  women are the main actors in home gardening and food is mainly produced for   in north-africa  oasis layered gardening with palm trees  fruit trees and vegetables is a traditional type of forest garden 
nepal  
in   the ghar bagaincha  literally  home garden   refers to the traditional land use system around a homestead  where several species of plants are grown and maintained by household members and their products are primarily intended for the family consumption  shrestha et al   2002   the term home garden is often considered synonymous to the kitchen garden  however  they differ in terms of function  size  diversity  composition and features  sthapit et al   2006   in nepal  72  of households have home gardens of an area 211  of the total land holdings  gautam et al   2004   because of their small size  the government has never identified home gardens as an important unit of food production and they thereby remain neglected from research and development  however  at the household level the system is very important as it is an important source of quality food and nutrition for the rural poor and  therefore  are important contributors to the household food security and livelihoods of farming communities in nepal  the gardens are typically cultivated with a mixture of annual and perennial plants that can be harvested on a daily or seasonal basis  biodiversity that has an immediate value is maintained in home gardens as women and children have easy access to preferred food  home gardens  with their intensive and multiple uses  provide a safety net for households when food is scarce  these gardens are not only important sources of food  fodder  fuel  medicines  spices  herbs  flowers  construction materials and income in many countries  they are also important for the in situ conservation of a wide range of unique genetic resources for food and agriculture  subedi et al   2004   many uncultivated  as well as neglected and underutilised species could make an important contribution to the dietary diversity of local communities  gautam et al   2004  
in addition to supplementing diet in times of difficulty  home gardens promote whole-family and whole-community involvement in the process of providing food  children  the elderly  and those caring for them can participate in this infield agriculture  incorporating it with other household tasks and scheduling  this tradition has existed in many cultures around the world for thousands of years

robert hart  forest gardening pioneer
coined the term  forest gardening  during the 1980s  hart began farming at
in
with the intention of providing a healthy and therapeutic environment for himself and his brother lacon  starting as relatively conventional   hart soon discovered that maintaining large annual vegetable beds  rearing livestock and taking care of an
were tasks beyond their strength  however  a small bed of perennial vegetables and herbs he planted was looking after itself with little intervention 
following hart s adoption of a
for health and personal reasons  he replaced his farm animals with plants  the three main products from a forest garden are fruit  nuts and   he created a model forest garden from a 0.12 acre  500m  orchard on his farm and intended naming his gardening method ecological horticulture or ecocultivation  hart later dropped these terms once he became aware that agroforestry and forest gardens were already being used to describe similar systems in other parts of the world  he was inspired by the
methods of
and james sholto douglas  and the productivity of the keralan home gardens as hart explains 
from the agroforestry point of view  perhaps the world s most advanced country is the indian state of kerala  which boasts no fewer than three and a half million forest gardens   as an example of the extraordinary intensivity of cultivation of some forest gardens  one plot of only 0.12 hectares  0.30 acres  was found by a study group to have twenty-three young coconut palms  twelve cloves  fifty-six bananas  and forty-nine pineapples  with thirty pepper vines trained up its trees  in addition  the small holder grew fodder for his  
seven-layer system  
the seven layers of the forest garden
pioneered a system based on the observation that the natural forest can be divided into distinct levels  he used
to develop an existing small orchard of apples and pears into an edible
landscape consisting of the following layers 
 consisting of the original mature fruit trees 
 of smaller nut and fruit trees on dwarfing root stocks 
 of fruit bushes such as currants and berries 
 of perennial vegetables and herbs 
 or underground dimension of plants grown for their roots and tubers 
 of edible plants that spread horizontally 
 of vines and climbers 
a key component of the seven-layer system was the plants he selected  most of the traditional vegetable crops grown today  such as   are sun loving plants not well selected for the more shady forest garden system  hart favoured shade tolerant perennial vegetables 
further development  
the
 art   managed by   runs experimental forest gardening projects on a number of plots in     crawford describes a forest garden as a low-maintenance way of
and other household products 
ken fern had the idea that for a successful temperate forest garden a wider range of edible shade tolerant plants would need to be used  to this end  fern created the organisation
 pfaf  which compiled a plant database suitable for such a system  fern used the term woodland gardening  rather than forest gardening  in his book plants for a future 
the
 mcl  promote forest gardening and other types of
to meet society s needs for food and natural resources  kathleen jannaway  the founder of mcl  wrote a book outlining a sustainable vegan future called abundant living in the coming age of the tree in 1991  in 2009  the mcl provided a grant of 1,000 to the bangor forest garden project in   north west wales 
kevin bradley coined the phrase edible forest in the 1980s as the name of his nursery  garden  and orchard on 5 acres in the frigid zone 3 pine forests of northern wisconsin  among 3 options  he chose edible forest because it  evokes at once an ethereal  spiritual  and magical image   of disney- like  forest of no return   of the biblical  garden of eden   this image was perfectly in line with his ongoing experiment begun in 1985 in what he calls a closed loop human environment  combining multi- story tree and field crop  garden orchards  for maximum beauty and use of space  someday to be very useful in an ever shrinking world   the name  at the same time  with its irrational first impression  of course we cant eat a forest   forces the mind to think  if just a little bit  about its inference and thus sticks in our memories   it appeared from bradleys research that the two words had  prior to the 80 s  never been put together before as a noun phrase but which by today  after more than two decades of bradley s  edible forest nursery  and the 2005 text by jacke and toensmeirer s-  edible forest gardens   has grown into a movement and little  edible forests  all over the world 
in 2005  dave jacke and eric toensmeier s two-volume edible forest gardens provided a deeply researched reference focused on north american forest gardening climates  habitats  and species  the book attempts to ground forest gardening deeply in ecological science  the
wiki grew out of their work  and seeks to document and share the experience of people around the world working with the species in polycultures 
permaculture  
  who coined the term   visited robert hart at his forest garden in wenlock edge in october 1990  hart s seven-layer system has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element 
numerous
are proponents of forest gardens  or food forests  such as graham bell    dave jacke  eric toensmeier and   bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book the permaculture garden in 1995  whitefield wrote the book how to make a forest garden in 2002  jacke and toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set edible forest gardening in 2005  and lawton presented the film establishing a food forest in 2008
