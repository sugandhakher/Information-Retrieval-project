a turbine  from the
turbo  a   related to the greek   tyrb  meaning     is a rotary mechanical device that extracts
from a
flow and converts it into useful   the work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a
or producing thrust  as in the case of   a turbine is a
with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly  which is a shaft or drum with
attached  moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor  early turbine examples are
and  
    and
turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid  credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to british engineer
 18541931  for invention of the   and to swedish engineer
 18451913  for invention of the   modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit  typically varying the
and impulse from the blade root to its periphery 
the word  turbine  was coined in 1822 by the french mining engineer
from the
turbo  or   in a memo   des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires  grande vitesse   which he submitted to the
in paris    a former student of claude burdin  built the first practical water turbine

is the stationary part of the machine 
a working fluid contains
 pressure   and
 velocity head   the fluid may be
or   several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy 
turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet  the resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy  there is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the
 the moving blades   as in the case of a steam or gas turbine  all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades  the nozzles   before reaching the turbine  the fluid s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a  
and
use this process exclusively  impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor 
describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines  impulse turbines are most efficient for use in cases where the flow is low and the inlet pressure is high 
turbines develop
by reacting to the gas or fluid s pressure or mass  the pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades  a pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage s  or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow  such as with wind turbines   the casing contains and directs the working fluid and  for water turbines  maintains the suction imparted by the  
and most
use this concept  for compressible working fluids  multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently 
describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines  reaction turbines are better suited to higher flow velocities or applications where the fluid head  upstream pressure  is low 
in the case of steam turbines  such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation  a parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de laval type impulse turbine  for the same degree of thermal energy conversion  whilst this makes the parsons turbine much longer and heavier  the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion 
in practice  modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible 
use an
to generate a reaction
from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor  wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind  by deflecting it at an angle  turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure  steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines  at low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in pressure  under these conditions  blading becomes strictly a reaction type design with the base of the blade solely impulse  the reason is due to the effect of the rotation speed for each blade  as the volume increases  the blade height increases  and the base of the blade spins at a slower speed relative to the tip  this change in speed forces a designer to change from impulse at the base  to a high reaction style tip 
classical turbine design methods were developed in the mid 19th century  vector analysis related the fluid flow with turbine shape and rotation  graphical calculation methods were used at first  formulae for the basic dimensions of turbine parts are well documented and a highly efficient machine can be reliably designed for any fluid   some of the calculations are empirical or  rule of thumb  formulae  and others are based on   as with most engineering calculations  simplifying assumptions were made 
turbine inlet guide vanes of a turbojet
can be used to calculate the basic performance of a turbine stage  gas exits the stationary turbine nozzle guide vanes at absolute velocity va1  the rotor rotates at velocity u  relative to the rotor  the velocity of the gas as it impinges on the rotor entrance is vr1  the gas is turned by the rotor and exits  relative to the rotor  at velocity vr2  however  in absolute terms the rotor exit velocity is va2  the velocity triangles are constructed using these various velocity vectors  velocity triangles can be constructed at any section through the blading  for example  hub  tip  midsection and so on  but are usually shown at the mean stage radius  mean performance for the stage can be calculated from the velocity triangles  at this radius  using the euler equation

and the turbine efficiency 
modern turbine design carries the calculations further 
dispenses with many of the simplifying assumptions used to derive classical formulas and computer software facilitates optimization  these tools have led to steady improvements in turbine design over the last forty years 
the primary numerical classification of a turbine is its   this number describes the speed of the turbine at its maximum efficiency with respect to the power and flow rate  the specific speed is derived to be independent of turbine size  given the fluid flow conditions and the desired shaft output speed  the specific speed can be calculated and an appropriate turbine design selected 
the specific speed  along with some fundamental formulas can be used to reliably scale an existing design of known performance to a new size with corresponding performance 
off-design performance is normally displayed as a
or characteristic 
types  
are used for the generation of electricity in thermal power plants  such as plants using  
or   they were once used to directly drive mechanical devices such as ships 
 for example the   the first turbine-powered    but most such applications now use reduction gears or an intermediate electrical step  where the turbine is used to generate electricity  which then powers an
connected to the mechanical load  turbo electric ship machinery was particularly popular in the period immediately before and during   primarily due to a lack of sufficient gear-cutting facilities in us and uk shipyards 
are sometimes referred to as turbine engines  such engines usually feature an inlet  fan  compressor  combustor and nozzle  possibly other assemblies  in addition to one or more turbines 
turbine  the gas flow in most turbines employed in gas turbine engines remains subsonic throughout the expansion process  in a transonic turbine the gas flow becomes supersonic as it exits the nozzle guide vanes  although the downstream velocities normally become subsonic  transonic turbines operate at a higher pressure ratio than normal but are usually less efficient and uncommon 
turbines  with   some efficiency advantage can be obtained if a downstream turbine rotates in the opposite direction to an upstream unit  however  the complication can be counter-productive  a contra-rotating steam turbine  usually known as the ljungstrm turbine  was originally invented by swedish engineer
 18751964  in stockholm  and in partnership with his brother birger ljungstrm he obtained a patent in 1894  the design is essentially a multi-stage
 or pair of  nested  turbine rotors  offering great efficiency  four times as large heat drop per stage as in the reaction  parsons  turbine  extremely compact design and the type met particular success in back pressure power plants  however  contrary to other designs  large steam volumes are handled with difficulty and only a combination with axial flow turbines  durex  admits the turbine to be built for power greater than ca 50 mw  in marine applications only about 50 turbo-electric units were ordered  of which a considerable amount were finally sold to land plants  during 1917-19  and during 1920-22 a few turbo-mechanic not very successful units were sold  only a few turbo-electric marine plants were still in use in the late 1960s  ss ragne  ss regin  while most land plants remain in use 2010 
turbine  multi-stage turbines have a set of static  meaning stationary  inlet guide vanes that direct the gas flow onto the rotating rotor blades  in a stator-less turbine the gas flow exiting an upstream rotor impinges onto a downstream rotor without an intermediate set of stator vanes  that rearrange the pressure velocity energy levels of the flow  being encountered 
turbine  conventional high-pressure turbine blades  and vanes  are made from nickel based alloys and often utilise intricate internal air-cooling passages to prevent the metal from overheating  in recent years  experimental ceramic blades have been manufactured and tested in gas turbines  with a view to increasing rotor inlet temperatures and or  possibly  eliminating air cooling  ceramic blades are more brittle than their metallic counterparts  and carry a greater risk of catastrophic blade failure  this has tended to limit their use in jet engines and gas turbines to the stator  stationary  blades 
turbine  many turbine rotor blades have shrouding at the top  which interlocks with that of adjacent blades  to increase damping and thereby reduce blade flutter  in large land-based electricity generation steam turbines  the shrouding is often complemented  especially in the long blades of a low-pressure turbine  with lacing wires  these wires pass through holes drilled in the blades at suitable distances from the blade root and are usually brazed to the blades at the point where they pass through  lacing wires reduce blade flutter in the central part of the blades  the introduction of lacing wires substantially reduces the instances of blade failure in large or low-pressure turbines 
  modern practice is  wherever possible  to eliminate the rotor shrouding  thus reducing the
load on the blade and the cooling requirements 
uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine 
  a type of impulse water turbine 
  a type of widely used water turbine 
  a variation of the francis turbine 
  a modified form of the pelton wheel 
  also known as banki-michell turbine  or ossberger turbine 
  these normally operate as a single stage without nozzle and interstage guide vanes  an exception is the   which has a stator and a rotor 
velocity compound  curtis   curtis combined the de laval and parsons turbine by using a set of fixed nozzles on the first stage or stator and then a rank of fixed and rotating blade rows  as in the parsons or de laval  typically up to ten compared with up to a hundred stages of a parsons design  the overall efficiency of a curtis design is less than that of either the parsons or de laval designs  but it can be satisfactorily operated through a much wider range of speeds  including successful operation at low speeds and at lower pressures  which made it ideal for use in ships  powerplant  in a curtis arrangement  the entire heat drop in the steam takes place in the initial nozzle row and both the subsequent moving blade rows and stationary blade rows merely change the direction of the steam  use of a small section of a curtis arrangement  typically one nozzle section and two or three rows of moving blades  is usually termed a curtis  wheel  and in this form  the curtis found widespread use at sea as a  governing stage  on many reaction and impulse turbines and turbine sets  this practice is still commonplace today in marine steam plant 
multi-stage impulse  or  rateau   after its french inventor    the rateau employs simple impulse rotors separated by a nozzle diaphragm  the diaphragm is essentially a partition wall in the turbine with a series of tunnels cut into it  funnel shaped with the broad end facing the previous stage and the narrow the next they are also angled to direct the steam jets onto the impulse rotor

almost all

most
rely on turbines to supply mechanical work from their working fluid and fuel as do all nuclear ships and power plants 
turbines are often part of a larger machine  a   for example  may refer to an internal combustion machine that contains a turbine  ducts  compressor  combustor  heat-exchanger  fan and  in the case of one designed to produce electricity  an alternator  combustion turbines and steam turbines may be connected to machinery such as pumps and compressors  or may be used for propulsion of ships  usually through an intermediate gearbox to reduce rotary speed 
reciprocating piston engines such as
can use a turbine powered by their exhaust to drive an intake-air compressor  a configuration known as a
 turbine   or  colloquially  a  turbo  
turbines can have very high power density  i e  the ratio of power to weight  or power to volume   this is because of their ability to operate at very high speeds  the

military jet engines  as a branch of gas turbines  have recently been used as primary flight controller in post-stall flight using jet deflections that are also called thrust vectoring  the u s
