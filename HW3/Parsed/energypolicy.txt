background  
although research is ongoing  the  human dimensions  of
are of increasing interest to business  utilities  and policymakers  using the
to gain insights into energy
can empower policymakers to make better decisions about broad-based climate and energy options  this could facilitate more     and

national energy policy  
measures used to produce an energy policy  
a national energy policy comprises a set of measures involving that country s laws  treaties and agency directives  the energy policy of a sovereign nation may include one or more of the following measures 
statement of national policy regarding   energy generation  transmission and usage
on commercial energy activities  trading  transport  storage  etc  
legislation affecting   such as  
instructions for state-owned energy sector assets and organizations
active participation in  co-ordination of and incentives for mineral
exploration  see   and other energy-related
related to energy products and services  taxes  exemptions  subsidies    
and international policy measures such as 
international energy sector treaties and alliances 
general international trade agreements 
special relations with energy-rich countries  including military presence and or domination 
frequently the dominant issue of energy policy is the risk of supply-demand mismatch  see     current energy policies also address environmental issues  see     particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws  some governments state explicit energy policy  but  declared or not  each government practices some type of energy policy  economic and energy modelling can be used by governmental or inter-governmental bodies as an advisory and analysis tool  see      
factors within an energy policy  
there are a number of elements that are naturally contained in a national energy policy  regardless of which of the above measures was used to arrive at the resultant policy  the chief elements intrinsic to an energy policy are 
what is the extent of energy self-sufficiency for this nation
where future energy sources will derive
how future energy will be consumed  e g  among sectors 
what fraction of the population will be acceptable to endure
what are the goals for future   ratio of energy consumed to
what is the reliability standard for distribution reliability
what environmental externalities are acceptable and are forecast
what form of  portable energy  is forecast  e g  sources of fuel for motor vehicles 
how will energy efficient hardware  e g  hybrid vehicles  household appliances  be encouraged
how can the national policy drive province  state and municipal functions
what specific mechanisms  e g  taxes  incentives  manufacturing standards  are in place to implement the total policy
what future consequences there will be for national security and foreign policy
state  province or municipal energy policy  
even within a state it is proper to talk about energy policies in   influential entities  such as
or regional governments and energy industries  will each exercise policy  policy measures available to these entities are lesser in   but may be equally important to national measures  in fact  there are certain activities vital to energy policy which realistically cannot be administered at the national level  such as monitoring
practices in the process of building construction  which is normally controlled by state-regional and municipal
