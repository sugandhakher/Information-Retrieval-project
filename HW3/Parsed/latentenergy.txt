latent heat is energy released or absorbed  by a body or a   during a constant-temperature process  an example is
for a   melting  at a specified temperature and pressure  the term was introduced around 1762 by
  it is derived from the latin latere  to lie hidden   black used the term in the context of
where a heat transfer caused a volume change while the thermodynamic system s temperature was constant 
in contrast to latent heat 
involves an energy transfer that results in a temperature change of the system

usage  
the terms sensible heat and latent heat are specific forms of energy  they are two properties of a material or in a thermodynamic system  sensible heat is a body s
that may be sensed or felt  latent heat is internal energy concerning the phase   solid   liquid   gas   of a material and does not affect the temperature 
both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transport of energy in nature  changes of latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric water 
and   whereas sensible heat is energy that reflects the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean  or ice 
the original usage of the term  as introduced by black  was applied to systems that were intentionally held at constant temperature  such usage referred to latent heat of expansion and several other related latent heats  these latent heats are defined independently of the conceptual framework of thermodynamics 
when a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example  it may expand by an amount described by its latent heat with respect to volume or latent heat of expansion  or increase its pressure by an amount described by its latent heat with respect to pressure 
two common forms of latent heat are
   and
    these names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next  from solid to liquid  and liquid to gas 
in both cases the change is   meaning that the system absorbs energy  for example  when water evaporates  energy is required for the water molecules to overcome the forces of attraction between them  the transition from water to vapor requires an input of energy 
if the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface  then the vapor s latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid s
onto the surface 
the large value of the
of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water  and is more hazardous 
meteorology  
in   latent heat flux is the
of heat from the earth s surface to the
that is associated with
or
of water at the surface and subsequent
of
in the   it is an important component of earth s surface energy budget  latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the
technique  or more recently since the mid-1900s by the
method 
history  
the english word
comes from latin   meaning lying hidden  the term latent heat was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 when   commissioned by producers of
in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process  to studying system changes  such as of volume and pressure  when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath 
characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles  i e  a form of   and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer  relating the latter to  
specific latent heat  
a specific latent heat  l  expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat  q  required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass  m   usually 1kg  of a substance as an

intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample  commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substances 
from this definition  the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated by

q is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance  in
