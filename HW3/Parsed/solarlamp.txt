a solar lamp also known as solar light or solar lantern  is a lighting system composed of an       charge controller and there may also be an   the lamp operates on electricity from batteries  charged through the use of solar photovoltaic panel 
solar-powered household lighting can replace other light sources like candles or   solar lamps use renewable energy with infinity supply which is cheaper than standard lamps  in addition  solar lamps reduce health risk as kerosene lamps have a bad impact on human health  however  solar lamps may have higher initial cost  are weather dependent 
solar lamps for use in rural situations often have the capability of providing a supply of electricity for other devices  such as for charging   american investors have been working towards developing a  10   unit solar lantern for replacement of kerosene lamps

history  
in the past solar panels used large crystals mainly made out of silicon which produced electricity when it was exposed to light  when electrons in silicon are exposed to light  they start to vibrate from their fixed positions following thermodynamics rules  furthermore  it produces heat from the vibration and the movement  through this  silicon turns a large portion of light energy into electricity  however  manufactures found silicon too expensive to make and to put in as a component of solar lamps 
photoelectric effect used in solar cells was first noted by   a french physicist  in 1839 
won a nobel prize in 1922 by exploring the nature of light and the photovoltaic technology based on photoelectric effect  the first photovoltaic module was built in 1954 by  
on the other hand  nowadays solar panels are made out of smaller and cheaper crystals  for example  copper   
and   these new crystals can be used to form thin flexible films  however these cheaper crystals are less efficient at turning light energy into electricity  therefore  it is an ongoing project to find a cheaper  efficient silicon substitute material that can be easily mass-produced and convert light into electricity very easily 
components  
the whole structure of solar lamp is shown in figure 2 
figure 1
solar cells solar panels  
solar panels are made out of crystals that are made out of
between electrons on the outer shell of silicon atoms  silicon is a
which is neither metals that conducts electricity nor insulators that do not conduct electricity  semiconductors normally do not conduct electricity but under certain circumstances they do in this example with exposition to light 
a
has two different layers of silicon  the lower layer has less electrons and hence has a slight positive charge due to the negative charge nature of electrons  in addition  the upper layer has more electrons and has slightly negative charge 
a barrier is created between these two layers however when the stream of light particles called photons enter  they give up their energy to the atoms in the silicon  it promotes one electron from a covalent bond to a next energy level from upper layer to the lower layer  this promotion of an electron allows freer movement within the crystal which produces a current  more light shines through  more electrons move around hence more current flows between  this process is called
and photoelectric effect  photovoltaic systems literally means combination of light and voltage and they use photovoltaic cells to directly convert sunlight into electricity 
solar panels are made out of layers of different materials  as you can see in figure 2  in order of glass  encapsulate  crystalline cells  encapsulate  back sheet  junction box and lastly frame  the encapsulate keeps out moisture and contaminants which could cause problems 
figure 2
battery  
a
is usually housed within a metal or plastic case  inside the case are electrodes including cathodes and anodes where chemical reactions occur  a separator also exists between cathode and anode which stops the electrodes reacting together at the same time as allowing electrical charge to flow freely between the two  lastly  the collector conducts a charge from the battery to outside 
batteries inside solar lamps usually use gel electrolyte technology with high performance in deep discharging  in order to enable use in extreme ranges of temperature  it may also use lead-acid  nickel metal hydride  nickel cadmium  or lithium 
this part of the lamp saves up energy from the solar panel and provides power when needed at night when there is no light energy available 
in general  the efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion is limited for physical reasons  around 24  of
of a long wavelength is not absorbed  33  is heat lost to surroundings  and further losses are of approximately 15-20   only 23  is absorbed which means a battery is a crucial part of solar lamp 
charge controller  
this section controls the entire working systems to protect battery charge  it ensures  under any circumstances including extreme weather conditions with large temperature difference  the battery does not overcharge or over discharge and damage the battery even further 
this section also includes additional parts such as light controller  time controller  sound  temperature compensation  lighting protection  reverse polarity protection and ac transfer switches which ensure sensitive back-up loads work normally when outage occurs 
inverter  
solar energy is produced in dc therefore dc-ac inverter is required to enable people to use ac power of either 220v ac or 110v ac 
working principles  
figure 3
led lights are used due to their high luminous efficiency and long life  under the control of a dc charge controller  non-contact control automatically turns on the light at dark and switches off at daytime  it sometimes also combines with time controllers to set curtain time for it to automatically switch light on and off 
as shown in figure 3  the chip includes microchip r   b-  b   s- and s   s  and s- are both connected to solar panels with wire  one of which has plus charge and the other minus charge  b- and b  are attached to two batteries in this case  the light will be shown through the led light when all of these are connected 
benefits  
solar lamps can be easier for customers to install and maintain as they do not require an electricity cable  solar lamps can benefit owners with reduced maintenance cost and costs of electricity bills  solar lamps can also be used in areas where there is no
or remote areas that lack a reliable electricity supply there are many stories of people with lung disease  eye deterioration  burns and sometimes even death simply because they do not have a healthy alternative to light at night  women have felt unsafe walking to the toilet outside after dark  babies are being delivered by midwives using only a candle  and students cannot study when the sun goes down for lack of light leading to increased illiteracy and perpetual poverty  these are the realities for over 1 billion people around the globe  lack of lighting equates to continued poverty felt around the world 
solar energy output is limited by weather and can be less effective if it is cloudy  wet  or winter 
households switching to solar lamps from kerosene lamps also gain from health risk associated with kerosene emissions  kerosene often has negative impacts on human lungs 
the use of solar energy minimizes the creation pollution indoors  where kerosene have been linked to cases of health issues  however  photovoltaic panels are made out of silicon and other toxic metals including
that can be difficult to
of 
the use of solar lights improves education for students who live in households without electricity  when the nonprofit unite-to-light donated solar-lamps to schools a remote region of kwa zulu natal in south africa test scores and pass rates improved by over 30   the light gives students added time to study after dark 
use  
solar street light  
main article 
these lights provide a convenient and cost-effective way to light streets at night without the need of ac electrical grids for pedestrians and drivers  they may have individual panels for each lamp of a system  or may have a large central solar panel and battery bank to power multiple lamps 
solar led lantern
rural  
in rural india  solar lamps  commonly called solar lanterns  using either leds or cfls  are being used to replace kerosene lamps  especially in areas where electricity is otherwise difficult to access  solar lamps are very useful and it will also improve life in rural areas
