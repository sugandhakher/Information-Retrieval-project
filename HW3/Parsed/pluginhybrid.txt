to connect to the   most phevs are passenger cars but there are also phev versions of commercial vehicles and vans  utility trucks  buses  trains  motorcycles    and military vehicles 
the cost of electricity to power plug-in hybrids for
has been estimated at less than one quarter of the cost of
in   compared to conventional vehicles  phevs produce less
locally and require less   phevs may produce less in the way of   which contribute to   than conventional vehicles do  phevs also eliminate the problem of
associated with all-electric vehicles  because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted  giving phevs driving-range comparable to that of other vehicles that have gasoline and diesel tanks  plug-in hybrids use no

plug-in hybrids greenhouse-gas emissions  during the operating in the all-electric range mode  depends on the type of power plant used to feed the electrical grid when the battery is charged   see     below   if the batteries are charged directly from renewable sources off the electrical grid  then the tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions are zero when running only on battery power  other benefits include improved national   less frequent fill-ups at the   the convenience of home recharging  opportunities to provide
in the home  and
 v2g  applications  several countries  including the united states  china  and several european countries  have enacted laws to ease the introduction of phevs through   emissions mandates  and financing research and development in advanced batteries and related technology

terminology  
plug-in hybrid
with phev-30  30mile or 48km   battery packs
a plug-in hybrid s
is designated by phev- miles  or phev kilometers km in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone  for example  a phev-20 can travel twenty miles  32km  without using its combustion engine  so it may also be designated as a phev32km 
the
defines a plug-in electric drive vehicle as a vehicle that 
motive power from a battery with a capacity of at least 4  
can be recharged from an external source of electricity for motive power  and
is a light-  medium-  or heavy-duty
or  
this distinguishes phevs from
cars
today  which do not use any electricity from the grid 
the
 ieee  defines phevs similarly  but also requires that the
be able to drive at least ten miles  16km  in
 phev-10  phev16km   while consuming no
or  
the
uses the term  off-vehicle charge capable   ovcc  to mean having the capability to charge a battery from an off-vehicle electric energy source that cannot be connected or coupled to the vehicle in any manner while the vehicle is being driven 
other popular terms sometimes used for plug-in hybrids are  grid-connected hybrids    gas-optional hybrid electric vehicle   go-hev  or simply  gas-optional hybrids  
calls its
plug-in hybrid an  extended-range electric vehicle

the   produced as early as 1899  was the first   early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation  however  the term  plug-in hybrid  has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket  the term  plug-in hybrid electric vehicle  was coined by
  who has been called the  father of the modern plug-in hybrid   the july 1969 issue of
featured an article on the
plug-in hybrid  the concept commuter vehicle housed six 12-volt leadacid batteries in the trunk area and a transverse-mounted dc electric motor turning a front-wheel drive  the car could be plugged into a standard north american 120 volt ac outlet for recharging

phevs are based on the same three basic
architectures as  
use an
 ice  to turn a   which in turn supplies current to an electric motor  which then rotates the vehicles drive wheels  a battery or
pack  or a combination of the two  can be used to store excess charge  examples of series hybrids vehicles include the
 first generation       elect road  toyota s japan-only
light-duty passenger bus   s hybrid
bus 
concept car  swissauto rex vw polo prototype and many   with an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ice  as is the case for other architectures  series hybrids can operate without recharging as long as there is liquid fuel in the tank 
  such as honda s     and
hybrids  can simultaneously transmit power to their drive wheels from two distinct sourcesfor example  an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric drive  although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle s engine and transmission  a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle s axles  while its electric motor drives the other axle and or a generator used for recharging the batteries  this type is called a road-coupled hybrid  the
duo plug-in hybrid concept car is an example of this type of parallel hybrid architecture  parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ice at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ice  both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ice vehicle 
have the flexibility to operate in either
or
mode  hybrid powertrains currently used by         and   which some refer to as series-parallel with power-split  can operate in both series and parallel mode at the same time  as of 2007  most plug-in hybrid conversions of conventional hybrids utilize this architecture  the
operates as a series-parallel hybrid 
charging systems  
batteries are dc devices while grid power is ac  in order to charge the batteries  a dc charger must be utilized  the charger can be located in several locations 
on-board chargers are mounted inside the vehicle  since the charger takes up space and adds weight  its power capacity is generally limited by practical considerations  avoiding carrying a more powerful charger that can only be fully utilized at certain locations  however  carrying the charger along with the vehicle ensures that power will be available anywhere a power connection can be found 
off-board chargers can be as large as needed and mounted at fixed locations  like the garage or dedicated charging stations  built with dedicated wiring  these chargers can handle much more power and charge the batteries more quickly  however  as the output of these chargers is dc  each battery system requires the output to be changed for that car  modern charging stations have a system for identifying the voltage of the battery pack and adjusting accordingly 
using electric motor s inverter allows the motor windings to act as the transformer coils  and the existing high-power inverter as the ac-to-dc charger  as these components are already required on the car  and are designed to handle any practical power capability  they can be used to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with zero additional weight or size 
uses this charging method  referred to as  reductive charging  
modes of operation  
regardless of its architecture  a plug-in hybrid may be capable of
and
modes  combinations of these two modes are termed
or mixed-mode  these vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in   either at low speeds only or at all speeds  these modes manage the vehicle s battery discharge strategy  and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required 
charge-depleting mode allows a fully charged phev to operate exclusively  or depending on the vehicle  almost exclusively  except during hard acceleration  on electric power until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level  at which time the vehicle s internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be   this period is the vehicle s   this is the only mode that a
can operate in  hence their limited range 
the redesigned
operates in blended mode  using engine and battery power simultaneously 
blended mode is a kind of charge-depleting mode  it is normally employed by vehicles which do not have enough electric power to sustain high speeds without the help of the internal combustion portion of the powertrain  a blended control strategy typically increases the distance from stored grid electricity compared to a charge-depleting strategy  the
and some toyota prius conversions are examples of vehicles that use this mode of operation  the electri cit and elect road versions of the kangoo were charge-depleting battery electric vehicles  the elect road had a modest internal combustion engine which extended its range somewhat  conversions of 2004 and later model toyota prius can only run without using the ice at speeds of less than about 42mph  68km h  due to the limits dictated by the vehicle s powertrain control software  however  at faster speeds electric power can still be used to displace gasoline  thus improving the fuel economy in blended mode and generally doubling the fuel efficiency 
charge-sustaining mode is used by
 hevs  today  and combines the operation of the vehicle s two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move outside a predetermined narrow band  over the course of a trip in a hev the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net change  the battery in a hev can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device  once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode  it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically 
mixed mode describes a trip in which a combination of the above modes are utilized  for example  a phev-20 prius conversion may begin a trip with 5 miles  8km  of low speed charge-depleting  then get onto a freeway and operate in blended mode for 20 miles  32km   using 10 miles  16km  worth of all-electric range at twice the fuel economy  finally the driver might exit the freeway and drive for another 5 miles  8km  without the internal combustion engine until the full 20 miles  32km  of all-electric range are exhausted  at this point the vehicle can revert to a charge sustaining-mode for another 10 miles  16km  until the final destination is reached  such a trip would be considered a mixed mode  as multiple modes are employed in one trip  this contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a phev s all-electric range  conversely  the portion of a trip which extends beyond the all-electric range of a phev would be driven primarily in charge-sustaining mode  as used by a conventional hybrid 
electric power storage

and
phevs typically require deeper
charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrids  because the number of full cycles influences battery life  this may be less than in traditional hevs which do not deplete their batteries as fully  however  some authors argue that phevs will soon become standard in the automobile industry  design issues and trade-offs against battery life  capacity  heat dissipation  weight  costs  and safety need to be solved  advanced battery technology is under development  promising greater energy densities by both mass and volume  and battery life expectancy is expected to increase 
the cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxide  this material is expensive  and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged  if the cobalt is replaced with   the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge  the price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about us 5000  some us 3000 of which is for their nimh battery packs  at early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices  that would mean a break-even point after six to ten years of operation  the conventional hybrid premium could fall to us 2000 in five years  with us 1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries  providing for a three-year payback  the payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids  because of their larger  more expensive batteries 
nickelmetal hydride and lithium-ion batteries can be recycled  toyota  for example  has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a us 200 credit for each battery returned  however  plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids  and thus require more resources 
 pg e  has suggested that utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load leveling purposes  they state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles  their residual capacity still has significant value  more recently 
 gm  has said it has been  approached by utilities interested in using recycled volt batteries as a power storage system  a secondary market that could bring down the cost of the volt and other plug-in vehicles for consumers

the optimum battery size varies depending on whether the aim is to reduce oil consumption  running costs  or emissions  but a recent study concluded that  the best choice of phev battery capacity depends critically on the distance that the vehicle will be driven between charges  our results suggest that for urban driving conditions and frequent charges every 10 miles or less  a low-capacity phev sized with an aer  all electric range  of about 7 miles would be a robust choice for minimizing gasoline consumption  cost  and greenhouse gas emissions  for less frequent charging  every 20100 miles  phevs release fewer ghgs  but hevs are more cost effective

target market  
  in miles  for several popular model year 2013 plug-in hybrids  as observed in testing by
magazine  providing greater all-electric range adds cost and entails compromises  so different all-electric ranges may suit different customers  needs 
with the exception of   demand for all-electric vehicles  especially in the u s  market  has been driven by     in particular  american sales of the
have depended on generous incentives and special treatment in the   the top selling leaf market  according to international market research  60  of respondents believe a battery driving range of less than 160km  99mi  is unacceptable even though only 2  drive more than that distance per day  among popular current all-electric vehicles  only the tesla  with the most expensive version of the
offering a 265 miles  426km  range in the
5-cycle test  significantly exceeds this threshold  the nissan leaf has an epa rated range of 75 miles  121km  for the 2013 model year 
plug-in hybrids provide the extended range and potential for refueling of conventional hybrids while enabling drivers to utilize battery electric power for at least a significant part of their typical daily driving  the average trip to or from work in the united states in 2009 was 11.8 miles  19.0km   while the average distance commuted to work in england and wales in 2011 was slightly lower at 9.3 miles  15km   since building a phev with a longer all-electric range adds weight and cost  and reduces cargo and or passenger space  there is not a specific all-electric range that is optimal  the accompanying graph shows the observed all-electric range  in miles  for four popular u s  market plug-in hybrids  as tested by
magazine 
a key design parameter of the
was a target of 40 miles  64km  for the   selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs  and mainly because research showed that 78  of daily
in the u s  travel 40mi  64km  or less  this target range would allow most travel to be accomplished electrically driven and the assumption was made that charging will take place at home overnight  this requirement translated using a
pack with an energy storage capacity of 16
considering that the battery would be used until the
 soc  of the battery reached 30  
in october 2014 general motors reported  based on data collected through its
system since volt deliveries began  and with over 1 billion miles  1.6 billion km  traveled  that volt owners drive about 62.5  of their trips in   in may 2016  ford reported  based on data collected from more than 610 million miles  976 million km  logged by its electrified vehicles through its telematics system  that drivers of these vehicles run an average of 13,500 miles  21,700km  annually on their vehicles  with about half of those miles operating in all-electric mode  a break down of these figures show an average daily commute of 42mi  68km  for ford energi plug-in hybrid drivers  ford notes that with the enhanced electric range of the 2017 model year model  the average
commuter could go the entire day using no gasoline  if the car is fully charged both  before leaving for work and before leaving for home  according to ford data  currently most customers are likely charging their vehicles only at home 
the 2015 edition of the epa s annual report  light-duty automotive technology  carbon dioxide emissions  and fuel economy trends  estimates the following utility factors for 2015
plug-in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver  whether in electric only or blended modes  83  for the   66  for the chevrolet volt  45  for the   43  for the   37  for the   and 29  for the   a 2014 analysis conducted by the
using a sample of 21,600 all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids  found that volt owners traveled on average 9,112 miles in all-electric mode  e-miles  per year  while leaf owners traveled 9,697 e-miles per year  despite the volt s shorter   about half of the leaf s 
between january and august 2014  a period during which us sales of conventional hybrids slowed  us sales of plug-in hybrids grew from 28,241 to 40,748 compared to the same period in 2013  us sales of all-electric vehicles also grew during the same period  from 29,917 vehicles in the january to august 2013 period to 40,349 in january to august 2014

of 35 miles  56km   and an additional gasoline-only extended range of 344 miles  554km  has an epa combined city highway fuel economy of 93 mpg-e in   and 37mpg-us  6.4l 100km  44mpg-imp  in gasoline-only mode  for an overall combined gas-electric fuel economy rating of 60mpg-us  3.9l 100km  72mpg-imp  equivalent  mpg-e   the epa also included in the volt s
a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios  30  45  60 and 75 miles  121km  driven between a full charge  and a never charge scenario  according to this table the fuel economy goes up to 168mpg-us  1.40l 100km  202mpg-imp  equivalent  mpg-e  with 45 miles  72km  driven between full charges 
for the more comprehensive
that will be mandatory in the u s  beginning in
2013  the
 nhtsa  and
 epa  issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids because of their design complexity  as phevs can operate in two or three operating modes  all-electric  blended  and gasoline-only  one label is for
or extended range electric vehicle  like the chevy volt   with all-electric and gasoline-only modes  and a second label for blended mode or   that includes a combination of both gasoline and plug-in electric operation  and gasoline only  like a  
rechargeit
available in the garage designated for converted plug-in hybrids at google s mountain view campus 
a further advantage of phevs is that they have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the phev s internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency  while a prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30  efficiency  well below the engine s 38  peak efficiency  the engine of a phev-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency  the actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation  inversion  battery charging discharging  the motor controller and motor itself  the way a vehicle is used  its    and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid 
the
 sae  developed their recommended practice in 1999 for testing and reporting the fuel economy of hybrid vehicles and included language to address phevs  an sae committee is currently working to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of phevs  the toronto atmospheric fund tested ten retrofitted plug-in hybrid vehicles that achieved an average of 5.8 litres per 100 kilometre or 40.6 miles per gallon over six months in 2008  which was considered below the technology s potential 
phev batteries also allow for an additional efficiency when converting solar power directly into a dc storage system  as opposed to converting the energy into ac home or building  dc to dc direct conversion is more efficient  therefore  potentially allowing the more efficient capture of solar energy 
in real world testing using normal drivers  some prius phev conversions may not achieve much better fuel economy than hevs  for example  a plug-in prius fleet  each with a 30 miles  48km  all-electric range  averaged only 51mpg-us  4.6l 100km  61mpg-imp  in a 17,000-mile  27,000km  test in seattle  and similar results with the same kind of conversion battery models at  s
initiative  moreover  the additional battery pack costs us 10,000us 11,000

phevs save around 60  or 40  in energy costs  compared with conventional gasoline vehicles and hevs  respectively  however  for drivers with significant daily vehicle miles traveled  dvmt   hybrid vehicles may be even a better choice than plug-in hybrids with a range of 40mi  64km   particularly when there is lack of public charging infrastructure 
the incremental battery cost of large-battery plug-in hybrids is difficult to justify based on the incremental savings of phevs operating costs unless a subsidy is offered for large-battery phevs 
when the price of gasoline increases from us 4 per gallon to us 5 per gallon  the number of drivers who benefit from a larger battery increases significantly  if the gas price is us 3  a plug-in hybrid with a range of 10mi  16km  is the least costly option even if the battery cost is  200 kw

as of 2016  there are five plug-in hybrids in the european market capable of driving around 50km  31mi   under
cycle  on the battery alone  the         and   other models with larger
are the
and   sold in the u s  and canada  and the   available in 49 countries 
as a response to range anxiety concerns  bmw is offering an optional limited capability gasoline
engine for its all-electric   the range-extender option costs an additional us 3,850 in the united states  4,710    us 6,300  in france  and 4,490    us 6,000  in the netherlands  the range-extender option of the bmw i3 was designed to meet the
 carb  regulation for an auxiliary power unit  apu  called rex  according to rules adopted in march 2012 by carb  the 2014 bmw i3 with a rex unit fitted will be the first car to qualify as a
or  bevx   carb describes this type of electric vehicle as  a relatively high-electric range battery-electric vehicle  bev  to which an apu is added   the unit  which maintains battery charge at about 30  after the pack has been depleted in normal use  is strictly limited in the additional range it can provide 
according to bmw  at the beginning of the i3 release  the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected  more than 60   over time it has decreased significantly  with some people almost never using it  and by 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5  of i3s  in early october 2014  general motors reported  based on data collected through its
system  that volt owners in north america have accumulated a total of 1 billion miles  1.6 billion km  traveled  of which  about 62.5  were driven in all-electric mode  a similar report  issued by gm in august 2016  reported that volt owners have accumulated almost 1.5 billion miles  2.4 billion km  driven in ev mode  representing 60  of their total miles traveled 
in a study published in june 2016  conducted by the norwegian   the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in norway drive on average 55  of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode     and the share goes up to about 63  for work trips  the share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer  and lower in the winter  the average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60  of the total distance in ev mode in the summer and 53  in winter  the estimate for work trips is higher at 70  in the summer and 59  in winter 
one of the advantages of the plug-in hybrid design is that the generator can be completely decoupled from the traction  unlike a conventional engine  which operates over a wide variety of power settings and operational conditions  the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all times  high-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for pev use  these include advanced close-cycle steam engines      and
due primarily to their light weight and small size

main article 
phevs and fully electric cars may allow for more efficient use of existing electric production capacity  much of which sits idle as
most of the time  this assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during
periods  i e   at night   or equipped with technology to shut off charging during periods of peak demand  another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads  this is accomplished with
technology  by using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power  such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities as well as their owners  even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime  and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure 
in the uk  vtg would need to comply with generation connection standard  g59/2   which means that it would need an earth rod at the premises  and would be unable to export more than 17kw without the network firm s permission  which feeding onto one phase  i e  for a normal house  would not be given - to maintain a balance of load across the three phases  
in october 2005  five toyota engineers and one asian aw engineer published an
technical paper detailing a toyota-approved project to add vehicle-to-grid capability to a toyota prius  although the technical paper described  a method for generating voltage between respective lines of neutral points in the generator and motor of the ths-ii  toyota hybrid system  to add a function for generating electricity   it did not state whether or not the experimental vehicle could be charged through the circuit  as well  however  the vehicle was featured in a toyota dream house  and a brochure for the exhibit stated that  the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the vehicles via the stand in the middle of the garage   indicating that the vehicle may have been a plug-in hybrid

main article 
disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional cost  weight  and size of a larger   according to a 2010 study by the   the cost of a
battery pack is about us 1,700  of usable energy  and considering that a phev-10 requires about 2.0kwh and a phev-40 about 8kwh  the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a phev-10 is around us 3,000 and it goes up to us 14,000 for a phev-40  according to the same study  even though costs are expected to decline by 35  by 2020  market penetration is expected to be slow and therefore phevs are not expected to significantly impact oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030  unless a fundamental breakthrough in battery technologies occurs

 2  assuming 15,000 miles per year 
according to the 2010 nrc study  although a mile driven on electricity is cheaper than one driven on gasoline  lifetime fuel savings are not enough to offset plug-ins high upfront costs  and it will take decades before the break even point is achieved  furthermore  hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies and incentives are likely to be required to achieve a rapid plug-in market penetration in the u s 
a 2013 study by the
reported that battery costs came down from us 1,300 per kilowatt hour in 2007 to us 500 per kilowatt hour in 2012  the
has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of us 300 per kilowatt hour in 2015 and us 125 per kilowatt hour by 2022  cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles 
a study published in 2011 by the     found that the gasoline costs savings of
over the vehicles lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices  this finding was estimated comparing their lifetime
at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the u s  market  and assuming no   according to the study estimates  a phev-40 is us 5,377 more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine  while a
 bev  is us 4,819 more expensive  the study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years  assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase  under the future scenarios considered  the study found that bevs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars  us 1,155 to us 7,181 cheaper   while phevs  will be more expensive than bevs in almost all comparison scenarios  and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices  bevs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel  while phevs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines

many authors have assumed that plug-in recharging will take place overnight at home  however  residents of cities  apartments  dormitories  and townhouses might not have garages or driveways with available power outlets  and they might be less likely to buy plug-ins unless recharging infrastructure is developed  electrical outlets or
near their places of residence  or in commercial or public
or streets or workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of phevs  even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers  however  this infrastructure is not in place today and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors

emissions shifted to electric plants  
increased
is expected to occur in some areas with the adoption of phevs  but most areas will experience a decrease  a study by the aceee predicts that widespread phev use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result in an increase in local net
and
emissions  given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the grid  although
could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants  the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity  the net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid  fossil or renewable  for example  and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves  identifying  regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plantor replacing a plant altogethermay also be more practical  from a human health perspective  shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage 
according to a 2009 study by the national academy of science   electric vehicles and grid-dependent  plug-in  hybrid vehicles showed somewhat higher nonclimate damages than many other technologies   efficiency of plug-in hybrids is also impacted by the overall efficiency of   transmission and distribution losses in the usa were estimated at 7.2  in 1995 and 6.5  in 2007  by life cycle analysis of air pollution emissions  natural gas vehicles are currently the lowest emitter   
tiered rate structure for electric bills  
electric utility companies generally do not utilize flat rate pricing  for example 
 pg e  normally charges  0.10 per
 kwh  for the base tier  but additional tiers are priced as high as  0.30 per kwh to customers without electric vehicles  some utilities offer electric vehicle users a rate
that provides discounts for off-peak usage  such as overnight recharging  pg e offers a special  discounted rate for plug-in and other electric vehicle customers  the  experimental time-of-use low emission vehicle rate   that tariff gives people much cheaper rates if they charge at night  especially during the summer months 
the additional electrical utilization required to recharge the plug-in vehicles could push many households in areas that do not have off-peak tariffs into the higher priced tier and negate financial benefits  without an off-peak charging tariff  one study of a certain phev-20 model having an all-electric range of 20 miles  gasoline-fueled efficiency of 52.7mi gal u s   and all-electric efficiency of 4mi kwh  found that household electricity customers who consumed 131 200  of baseline electricity at  0.220  kwh  would see benefits if gasoline was priced above us 2.89 us gal  those that consumed 201 300  of baseline electricity at  0.303  kwh  would only see benefits if gas was priced above  3.98  and households consuming over 300  of baseline electricity at  0.346  kwh  would only see benefits if gasoline was priced above  4.55  usd gal   off-peak tariff rates can lower the break-even point  the pg e tariff would change those break-even gasoline prices to us 1.96   3.17 and  3.80 per gallon  respectively  for the given phev and usage pattern in question 
customers under such tariffs could see significant savings by being careful about when the vehicle was charged  for example  by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours  thus  an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed operational cost of electric mode vehicle operation

greenhouse gas emissions  
see also 
the effect of phevs on greenhouse emissions is complex  plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on
do not emit harmful
from the onboard source of power  the clean air benefit is usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries  air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants  in the same way  phevs do not emit
from the onboard source of power  but from the point of view of a   the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for   from the perspective of a full   the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as       or
for pevs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions  on the other hand  when pevs are recharged from -fired plants  they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than
vehicles  in the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle when operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine  tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher  
there has been much debate over the potential ghg emissions reductions that can be achieved with phev  a study by the
reports that a 338
or 5.8  increase in power generation needed as a result of phev  in the same report the epri also states that co2 emissions could increase by 430 million metric tons  the article concludes 
 in summary  the addition of phevs as a significant transportation option adds approximately 6  to the total national electricity demand in 2030 compared to the base case with no phevs  due to the charging profile that results in most of this additional demand occurring during off-peak hours  late night early morning  there is an increase in the need for baseload generation  the addition of coal-fired generation to meet this need for more baseload generation does not result in any significant differences in annual emissions of so2  nox and hg because of the caps on those pollutants  therefore  any reductions in emissions of so2  nox or hg from non-electric generating sources would result in a net national decline in these emissions  however  it does result in an appreciable increase in co2 and pm emissions as this analysis has not assumed any limits on co2 or pm emissions  
a study by the
predicts that  on average  a typical american driver is expected to achieve about a 15  reduction in net
emissions compared to the driver of a regular hybrid  based on the 2005 distribution of power sources feeding the us electrical grid  the aceee study also predicts that in areas where more than 80  of grid-power comes from coal-burning power plants  local net co
2 emissions will increase  while for phevs recharged in areas where the grid is fed by power sources with lower co
2 emissions than the current average  net co
2 emissions associated with phevs will decrease correspondingly 
a 2007 joint study by the
 epri  and the
 nrdc  similarly found that the introduction of phevs into americas consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions  the epri-nrdc report estimates that  between 2010 and 2050  a shift toward phev use could reduce ghg emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric tons  the magnitude of these reductions would ultimately depend on the level of phev market penetration and the carbon intensity of the us electricity sector  in general  phevs can be viewed as an element in the   wedges  approach which shows a way to stabilize co
2 emissions using a portfolio of existing techniques  including efficient vehicles 
a 2008 study at
suggests that for phev s to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than hybrids a
signal that encourages the development of low carbon power is needed 
also in 2008 studied the questions of a   carbon
systems  increasing gasoline tax  and providing renewable energy subsidies under various economic conditions and vehicle type availabilities  rand found that subsidies were able to provide a smoother transition to new energy sources  especially in the face of energy source price volatility  because subsidies can be structured according to relative costs between renewables and fossil fuel  while taxes and carbon trading schemes alone do not take relative prices of energy into account 
the minnesota pollution control agency found that if minnesota s fleet of vehicles making lengthy trips were replaced by plug-in hybrids  co
2 emissions per vehicle would likely decrease  however  unless more than 40  of the electricity used to charge the vehicles were to come from non-polluting sources  replacing the vehicles with non-plug-in hybrids would engender a larger decrease in co
2 emissions  plug-in hybrids use less fuel in all cases  and produce much less carbon dioxide in short commuter trips  which is how most vehicles are used  the difference is such that overall carbon emissions would decrease if all internal combustion vehicles were converted to plug-ins 
a study by kantor  fowler  hajimiragha  and elkamel shows that fuel cell plug-in hybrid vehicles achieve twice as much reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than phevs and fcvs  the study uses the transportation sector in ontario canada as a case study  with the maximum allowable number of vehicles being that which can be supported by the electric grid

the argonne study found that phevs offered reductions in petroleum energy use as compared with regular hybrid electric vehicles  more petroleum energy savings and also more ghg emissions reductions were realized as the all-electric range increased  except when electricity used to recharged was dominated by coal or oil-fired power generation  as expected  electricity from renewable sources realized the largest reductions in petroleum energy use and ghg emissions for all phevs as the all-electric range increased  the study also concluded that plug-in vehicles that employ biomass-based fuels  biomass-e85 and -hydrogen  may not realize ghg emissions benefits over regular hybrids if power generation is dominated by fossil sources

in october 2014  the
published the 2014 edition of its annual report  light-duty automotive technology  carbon dioxide emissions  and fuel economy trends   for the first time  the report presents an analysis of the impact of   with emphasis in
because as their market share is approaching 1   pevs began to have a measurable impact on the u s  overall new vehicle fuel economy and co2 emissions 
epa s report included the analysis of 12 all-electric passengers cars and 10 plug-in hybrids available in the market as
2014  for purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions  the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between those phevs like the
that can operate in
without using gasoline  and those that operate in a blended mode like the   which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle  but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode  in addition  since the
of plug-in hybrids depends on the size of the battery pack  the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection  on average  of the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity  in electric only and blended modes  by an average driver  the following table shows the overall ev hybrid fuel economy expressed in terms of
 mpg-e  and the utility factor for the ten my2014 plug-in hybrids available in the u s  market  the study used the utility factor  since in pure ev mode there are no tailpipe emissions  and the epa best estimate of the co2
produced by these vehicles in real world city and highway operation based on the epa 5-cycle label methodology  using a weighted 55  city 45  highway driving  the results are shown in the following table 
in addition  the epa accounted for the upstream co2 emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity required to charge the phevs  since electricity production in the united states varies significantly from region to region  the epa considered three scenarios ranges with the low end of the range corresponding to the california powerplant emissions factor  the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor  and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the rockies  the epa estimates that the electricity ghg emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346 g co2 kw-hr in california to 986 g co2 kw-hr in the rockies  with a national average of 648 g co2 kw-hr  the following table shows the tailpipe emissions and the combined tailpipe and upstream emissions for each of the 10 my 2014 phevs available in the u s  market

notes   1  based on 45  highway and 55  city driving   2  the utility factor represents  on average  the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity  in electric only and blended modes  by an average driver   3  the epa classifies the i3 rex as a
plug-in hybrid
national bureau of economic research  
most emission analysis use average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation at different times of the day  the former approach does not take into account the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day  an analysis by three economist affiliated with the
 nber   published in november 2014  developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the united states  the study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009  and used the specifications for the
  of 35mi  56km    the analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the
compared to the   and within regions  rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others  applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles  the nber researchers found that the emissions of charging pevs vary by region and hours of the day  in some regions  such as the western u s  and texas  co2 emissions per mile from driving pevs are less than those from driving a hybrid car  however  in other regions  such as the upper midwest  charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a m  implies that pevs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road  the results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions  this occurs because coal-fired units  which have higher emission rates  are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand  while natural gas units  which have relatively low emissions rates  are often brought online to meet peak demand  this pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening
