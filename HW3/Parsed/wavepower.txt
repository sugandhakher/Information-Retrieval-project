wave power is the transport of energy by   and the capture of that energy to do useful
 for example      or the
of water  into reservoirs   a machine able to exploit wave power is generally known as a wave energy converter  wec  
wave power is distinct from the diurnal flux of

waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea  as long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves  there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves  both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave   as well as friction on the water surface by the wind  making the water to go into the
causes the growth of the waves 
is determined by wind speed  the duration of time the wind has been blowing  fetch  the distance over which the wind excites the waves  and by the depth and topography of the seafloor  which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves   a given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves  when this limit has been reached the sea is said to be  fully developed  
in general  larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed    and water  
is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth  however  for
   near a reflecting coast  wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth  producing   these pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power 
the waves propagate on the ocean surface  and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the   the mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical
of unit width  parallel to a wave crest  is called the wave energy
 or wave power  which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device

with p the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length  hm0 the   te the wave energy    the water
and g the   the above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the
of the wave height  when the significant wave height is given in metres  and the wave period in seconds  the result is the wave power in kilowatts  kw  per metre of
length 
example  consider moderate ocean swells  in deep water  a few km off a coastline  with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds  using the formula to solve for power  we get

meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest 
in major storms  the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds  according to the above formula  such waves carry about 1.7mw of power across each metre of wavefront 
an effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux  as a result  the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device

deep-water characteristics and opportunities  
deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength  which is the common situation in the sea and ocean  in deep water  longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster  the deep-water group velocity is half the   in   for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth  as found quite often near the coast  the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity 
history  
the first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799  and was filed in paris by
and his son  an early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by bochaux-praceique to light and power his house at   near
in france  it appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device  from 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the uk alone 
modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by  s experiments in the 1940s  he has tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea  with several hundred units used to power navigation lights  among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft  which was proposed in the 1950s by masuda 
a renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the   a number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves  among whom notably were
from the  
and
from
 now merged into   
from  
from   michael french from  
and
from  
stephen salter s
became known as
or nodding duck  although it was officially referred to as the edinburgh duck  in small scale controlled tests  the duck s curved cam-like body can stop 90  of wave motion and can convert 90  of that to electricity giving 81  efficiency 
in the 1980s  as the oil price went down  wave-energy funding was drastically reduced  nevertheless  a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea  more recently  following the issue of climate change  there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy  including wave energy 
the world s first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the uk  based in orkney  scotland  the
has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world  emec provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions  it s grid connected wave test site is situated at billia croo  on the western edge of the orkney mainland  and is subject to the full force of the atlantic ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site  wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include    
and  
modern technology  
wave power devices are generally categorized by the method used to capture the energy of the waves  by location and by the power take-off system  locations are shoreline  nearshore and offshore  types of power take-off include      pump-to-shore    air turbine  and   when evaluating
as a technology type  it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches  point absorber buoys  surface attenuators  oscillating water columns  and overtopping devices 
generic wave energy concepts  1  point absorber  2  attenuator  3  oscillating wave surge converter  4  oscillating water column  5  overtopping device  6  submerged pressure differential
point absorber buoy  
this device floats on the surface of the   held in place by cables connected to the seabed  buoys use the rise and fall of swells to drive hydraulic pumps and generate  
generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms  the presence of the buoys may affect fish  marine mammals  and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites  potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines  energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline  resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore 
surface attenuator  
these devices act similarly to   with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves  a flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity  environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys  with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints 
oscillating wave surge converter  
these devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move 
is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point  oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats  flaps  or membranes  environmental concerns include minor risk of collision  artificial reefing near the fixed point 
effects from subsea cables  and energy removal effecting sediment transport  some of these designs incorporate
as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture  these capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy  once the wave energy is captured at a wave source  power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the
by
 
oscillating water column  
devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore  with an air chamber integrated into the device  swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create   significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines  potentially affecting
and other
within the vicinity of the device  there is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers 
overtopping device  
overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean  the potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines  devices can be either on shore or floating offshore  floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting   organisms becoming entangled  or emf effects produced from   there is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat

common environmental concerns associated with
developments include 
the risk of

being struck by tidal
blades 
the effects of
and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices 
the physical presence of
projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals  fish  and
with attraction or avoidance 
the potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as
and  
the
provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of wave energy 
potential  
the worldwide resource of wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 tw  locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of europe  the northern coast of the uk  and the pacific coastlines of north and south america  southern africa  australia  and new zealand  the north and south
have the best sites for capturing wave power  the prevailing
in these zones blow strongest in winter 
world wave energy resource map
challenges  
there is a potential impact on the marine environment  noise pollution  for example  could have negative impact if not monitored  although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly  other biophysical impacts  flora and fauna  sediment regimes and water column structure and flows  of scaling up the technology is being studied  in terms of socio-economic challenges  wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds  can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment  and may represent hazards to safe navigation  waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power  of those 2,700 gigawatts  only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology

portugal  
the
was the world s first   it was located 5km  3mi  offshore near   north of   portugal  the farm was designed to use three
wave energy converters to convert the motion of the
into electricity  totalling to 2.25
in total installed capacity  the farm first generated electricity in july 2008 and was officially opened on september 23  2008  by the portuguese minister of economy  the wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in november 2008 as a result of the financial collapse of babcock   brown due to the global economic crisis  the machines were off-site at this time due to technical problems  and although resolved have not returned to site and were subsequently scrapped in 2011 as the technology had moved on to the p2 variant as supplied to eon and scottish power renewables  a second phase of the project planned to increase the installed capacity to 21 mw using a further 25 pelamis machines is in doubt following babcock s financial collapse 
united kingdom  
funding for a 3 mw wave farm in scotland was announced on february 20  2007  by the   at a cost of over 4 million   as part of a 13 million funding package for   the first machine was launched in may 2010 
a facility known as
has been constructed off the north coast of cornwall  england  to facilitate wave energy development  the wave hub will act as giant extension cable  allowing arrays of wave energy generating devices to be connected to the electricity grid  the wave hub will initially allow 20 mw of capacity to be connected  with potential expansion to 40 mw  four device manufacturers have so far expressed interest in connecting to the wave hub  the scientists have calculated that wave energy gathered at wave hub will be enough to power up to 7,500 households  the site has the potential to save greenhouse gas emissions of about 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide in the next 25 years
