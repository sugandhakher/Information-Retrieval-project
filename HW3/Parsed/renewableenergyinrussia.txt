history  
in the   large hydropower plants were among the
  pictured 
most sources of renewable energy are new to russia and have experienced development in recent years  however  hydroelectric power has a long history in russia  dating back to the soviet era  the rapid expansion of hydroelectric power in the soviet union began in 1930  when the total installed capacity equaled 600mwh  the
built its first windmill in 1941  which had a capacity of 100kw  by the time the soviet union collapsed in 1990  it had a total installed capacity of 65 gwh  the largest dams that russia currently has  including the   were built in the 1950s and 1960s  from the 1970s to 2000  the soviet union and russia focused mainly on  traditional  power sources  thermal-  hydro- and nuclear power  however  in 1986  the soviet government announced new energy goals  which included further hydroelectric plant construction as well as the start of small-scale solar and wind use for electricity production  overall 
focused on nuclear and thermal power  although renewable energy was not completely neglected  the
prevented those goals from being fulfilled 
the construction of the large dams prominent in soviet times largely ended in the 1990s with the creation of the russian federation  in addition  due to the post-soviet recession  much of the country s infrastructure  including dams  fell into disrepair  use of oil and gas for energy took priority in russia and renewable energy was ignored  this policy lasted until 2008  when medvedev announced reforms to russia s energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy  since then  there has been rapid development of new renewable energy sources 
current status  
main article 
russia s electricity generation by source  2008 
had a 16  share that year  while other types of renewable sources accounted for less than 1  
russia is one of the world s largest producers of energy  most of which it obtains from  
and   the country s focus on those resources for production and export  which constitute 80  of foreign trade earnings  means it has paid little attention to renewable energy  out of the 203gw of electric generation capacity that russia has  44gw comes from hydroelectricity  307mw from   15mw from
and negligible amounts from other renewable sources  in 2009  the russian energy industry generated a total 992twh of electricity  176twh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations  some of russia s hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment  as shown by the
in 2009 
president
announced in may 2010 that the russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from renewable energy sources in an attempt to encourage development of renewable energy  the government has plans for 4.5  of russia s energy output to come from non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources  additionally  in november 2010  the government approved a us 300billion program to make factories and buildings more   it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants  promote
and support the construction of a
plant  medvedev announced in late 2009 that he wanted to cut russian energy consumption by 40  by 2020  at the moment  development is slowed by low investment  economic instability  low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity  subsidies for natural gas are another obstacle to renewable energy development 
hydropower  
during a
hydropower is the most used form of renewable energy in russia  and there is large potential in russia for more use of hydropower  russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100mw  making it fifth in the world for hydropower production  it is also second in the world for hydro potential  yet only 20  of this potential is developed  russia is home to 9  of the world s hydro resources  mostly in siberia and the country s far east  at the end of 2005  the generating capacity from
sources in russia was 45,700mw  and an additional 5,648mw was under construction  the
believes that russia has much potential for using its hydro resources  with a theoretical potential of about 2,295twh yr  with 852twh being economically feasible 
the largest dams in russia are the   which has an installed capacity of 6,400mw  the
 6,000mw   the
 4,500mw   the
 4,320mw  and the
 1,330mw   some of the most recent dam projects are the
 2010mw  and the
 800mw   the
 1920mw   zelenchuk dam  320mw   zaramag dam  352mw  and nizhne-chereksky  60mw  are currently under construction 
is the largest hydroelectric company in russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world  in october 2010    the largest hydropower corporation in china  and   a russian energy company  signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in russia and export energy to china s northern territories  the
has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the
region before 2015 
on 17 august 2009  there was an
at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric power plant  which killed 75 plant workers and injured 13  the  s investigation concluded that poor management and technical flaws were responsible  the explosion was caused by a 29-year-old turbine that experienced an uncontrolled and excessive vibration  since then  officials from rushydro  the operator of the plant  have called for better oversight and safety at hydroelectric plants 
geothermal energy  
main article 
geothermal energy is the second most used form of renewable energy in russia but represents less than 1  of the total energy production  the first geothermal power plant in russia was built at pauzhetka    in 1966  with a capacity of 5mw  the total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79mw  with 50mw coming from a plant at verkhne-mutnovsky  russia is currently developing a 100mw plant at mutnovsky and a 50mw plant in   most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the
and   half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings  one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13  is used for industrial processes 
in october 2010    russia s energy minister  stated that russia and iceland would work together to develop kamchatka s geothermal energy sources  russia is also investigating foreign investment possibilities for developing geothermal energy in the  
solar energy

solar
in europe
solar energy is virtually nonexistent in russia  despite its large potential in the country  the first russian
was opened in
in november 2010  russia has a total theoretical potential of 2,213twh yr for solar energy  with an economically feasible amount of 101twh  the southern parts of russia  especially the north caucasus  have the greatest potential for solar energy  russia plans to set up an overall solar capacity of 150mw by 2020 
plans for the construction of a new solar plant on the
have been announced and the plant is expected to begin operations by 2012  this plant  which will have a capacity of 12.3mw  is being built by
and   solar wind llc and rusnano are building a plant that will produce double-sided solar panels  which will be able to collect solar energy from both sides  construction is expected to finish in early 2011 and the plant will have an annual manufacturing capacity of 30mw 
is the largest russian company in the area of scientific development and manufacture of products used to generate solar energy  russia and india are currently discussing the possibility of a joint venture to produce
for the creation of
cells 
an auction in 2013 awarded contracts for 399 mw of solar  and one in 2014 an additional 505 mw  a third auction in 2015 awarded 280 mw of solar 
in 2015  the russian solar energy association predicted that cumulative solar power capacity in the country would rise to 1,500 mw by 2020 
wind energy  
main article 
wind turbine near an     the wind power potential of
is one of the largest among russian regions 
russia has a long history of small-scale wind energy use but has never developed large-scale commercial wind energy production  most of its current wind production is located in agricultural areas with low population densities where connection to the main energy grid is difficult  russia is estimated to have a total potential of 80,000 twh yr for wind energy  6,218twh yr of which is economically feasible  most of this potential is found in the southern steppes and the seacoasts of russia  although in many of these areas the population density is less than 1 person per square km  this low population density means that there is little existing electricity infrastructure currently in place  which hinders development of these resources  in 2006  russia had a total installed wind capacity of 15mw  current russian wind energy projects have a combined capacity of over 1,700mw  the russian wind energy association predicts that if russia achieves its goal of having 4.5  of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020  the country will have a total wind capacity of 7gw 
in 2010  plans for the construction of a wind power plant in   on the   were announced  it is expected to initially have a capacity of 50mw  which will become 100mw a year later  german engineering company
announced in july 2010  following a visit to russia by chancellor   that it would build wind power plants in russia  by 2015  the company hopes to install 1,250mw of capacity in russia 
tidal energy  
is the location of the proposed   which could become the world s largest electric power station 
russia has many tidal energy resources at its disposal  although they are currently underdeveloped as well  the
and
alone could produce 100gw with tidal power stations  and the national energy potential from tidal energy can compete with current total energy production  the currently active
is the largest tidal power facility in russia and has the
 1.7mw  among the world s  
plans for constructing an 800mw tidal power plant in the
were announced in 2008  possible long-term projects include the   which could become the largest power station in the world  with an installed capacity of up to 87 and an annual production of 200 
biofuel  
russia s
industry is new  but it has been developing rapidly in recent years  russia is one of the largest grain producers  has a well-developed
industry and has increasing
 often used to create   production rates  the russian government declared in 2008 that it would play an active role in developing the biofuel industry by building 30 new biofuel plants and providing tax breaks and subsidized interest rates to biofuel energy projects  although these plans were delayed  on 13 september 2010  medvedev announced that construction would begin in early 2011    the biofuel produced by these plants  would be produced from
by-products  such as
and  
has the largest
capacity in the world
  a russian car manufacturer  produced its first biofuel-powered automobile in november 2010  deputy transportation minister valery okulov stated that russian companies are currently developing helicopters that run on biofuel  russia hopes to export biofuel to the   the country s biotechnology corporation estimates that russia is capable of exporting 40 million tons of biofuel annually 
biomass  
is already used in some parts of russia to provide a total of 1   or 9twh year  of russia s total energy  however  due to russia s vast forest and
reserves  it has a total biomass technical potential of 431twh year  of which 285twh year is economically feasible  most of this potential is found in northwestern russia  which has a developed
and
industry that can provide wood-based waste to use as biomass energy 
use of peat for energy production was prominent during the soviet union  with the peak occurring in 1965 and declining from that point  in 1929  over 40  of the soviet union s electric energy came from peat  which dropped to 1  by 1980  currently  russia is responsible for 17  of the world s peat production  and 20  of the peat that it produces  1.5 million tons  is used for energy purposes
