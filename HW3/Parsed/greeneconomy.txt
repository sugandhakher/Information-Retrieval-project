the green economy is defined as an
that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities  and that aims for
without degrading the environment  it is closely related with   but has a more politically applied focus  the 2011
green economy report argues  that to be green  an economy must not only be efficient  but also fair  fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions  particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon  resource efficient  and socially inclusive  
a feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of
and
as having economic value  see
and   and a
regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to  and accounted for as liabilities of  the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset 
green sticker and
practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development  many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a
economy

 green  economists and economics  
 green economics  is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides  after    a holistic approach to the subject is typical  such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects  depending on the particular theorist  proponents of     the      
and
movement have used the term to describe very different ideas  all external to some equally ill-defined  mainstream     
the use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of
which are formally organized and claim the capital-g  green  term as a unique and distinguishing mark  it is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of   green economists   who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy 
and a fuller accounting for    see
especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and
for a layperson s presentation of these    
some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools  for instance  it is regarded as
where the traditional land is generalized to
and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital  since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as    or  it is viewed as
with nature represented as a form of   an exploited base of non-human workers providing
to the human economy  or as a branch of
in which the
for developing vs  developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low   
an increasing commitment by the unep  and national governments such as the uk  to the ideas of
and
under the banner  green economy  could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of  green economics   as of 2010 the
institutions  notably the
and
 via its  green fund  initiative  responsible for global
have stated a clear intention to move towards
valuation and a more official and universal     taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the     the unep 2011 green economy report informs that   b ased on existing studies  the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range us  1.05 to us  2.59 trillion  to place this demand in perspective  it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year  as measured by global gross capital formation  
definition  
karl burkart defines a green economy as based on six main sectors 
the three pillars of sustainability 
the
 icc  representing global business defines green economy as an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development 
in 2012  the icc published the green economy roadmap  containing contributions from experts from around the globe brought together in a two-year consultation process  the roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of green economy  it highlights the essential role of business in bringing solutions to common global challenges  it sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy 
open and competitive markets
metrics  accounting  and reporting
finance and investment
awareness
life cycle approach
resource efficiency and decoupling
employment
education and skills
governance and partnership
integrated policy and decision-making
ecological measurements  
measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of
indicators  green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact  efficiency sectors like transport  energy  buildings and tourism  as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation 
2010 - 2016 global green economy index  ggei   published by consultancy dual citizen llc is in its 5th edition  it measures the green economic performance and perceptions of it in 80 countries and 50 cities along four main dimensions of leadership   climate change  efficiency sectors  markets   investment and the environment 
2009 - 2012 green city index
a global study commissioned by
2009 - 2013
project scored 5 cities in 5 separate countries 
measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments 
green energy issues  
green economies require
generation based on
to replace
as well as
and    
there is justification for
to respond to
and
needs with the excuse that high
and high initial costs for research  development  and marketing of
sources and green products prevents firms from voluntarily reducing their ecological footprints  the green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services  the   legislations of many other
and the   all provide such market incentives    however  other experts argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer 
criticisms  
a number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the  green economy   particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using   arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water  the research organisation etc group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy  will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years   venezuelan professor edgardo lander says that the unep s report  towards a green economy  while well-intentioned  ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets  even when a large majority of the population call for them  is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations   ulrich hoffmann  in a paper for
also says that the focus on green economy and  green growth  in particular   based on an evolutionary  and often reductionist  approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate change  and  may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a u-turn of global   clive spash  an ecological economist  has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses  and argued that the green economy  as advocated by the un  is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis  he has also criticised the un s project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity  teeb   and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms
