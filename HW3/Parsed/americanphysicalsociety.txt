history  
the american physical society was founded on may 20  1899  when thirty-six physicists gathered at
for that purpose  they proclaimed the mission of the new society to be  to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics   and in one way or another the aps has been at that task ever since  in the early years  virtually the sole activity of the aps was to hold scientific meetings  initially four per year  in 1913  the aps took over the operation of the   which had been founded in 1893 at   and
publication became its second major activity  the physical review was followed by
in 1929 and by
in 1958  over the years  phys  rev  has subdivided into five separate sections as the fields of physics proliferated and the number of submissions grew 
in more recent years  the activities of the society have broadened considerably  stimulated by the increase in federal funding in the period after the   and even more by the increased public involvement of scientists in the 1960s  the aps is active in public and governmental affairs  and in the international physics community  in addition  the society conducts extensive programs in education 
 specifically    and media relations  aps has 14 divisions and 11 topical groups covering all areas of physics research  there are 6 forums that reflect the interest of its 50,000 members in broader issues  and 9 sections organized by geographical region 
in 1999  aps physics celebrated its centennial with the biggest-ever physics meeting in   in 2005  aps took the lead role in united states participation in the   initiating several programs to broadly publicize physics during the 100th anniversary of  s     one of the projects aps initiated during world year of physics  is an ongoing and popular
project 
name change proposal  
during the summer of 2005  the society conducted an electronic poll  in which the majority of aps members preferred the name american physics society  the poll became the motivation for a proposal of a name change promised in the leadership election that year  however  because of legal issues  the planned name change was eventually abandoned by the aps executive board 
to promote public recognition of aps as a physics society  while retaining the name american physical society  the aps executive board adopted a new logo incorporating the phrase  aps physics   general use of aps physics to refer to aps or the american physical society is encouraged  the new aps physics logo was designed by  
marvin cohen  lbnl faculty senior scientist  university professor of physics  university of california  berkeley  who was aps president in november 2005  when the logo was approved by the executive board  said   i like the logo  at least now when you are in an elevator at an aps meeting and someone looks at your badge  they won t ask you about sports
