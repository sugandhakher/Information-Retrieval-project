elliot  m   2004    united kingdom  parliamentary sovereignty under pressure   international journal of constitutional law  2  3   545627      notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes  an important common factor is that the u k  parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned  for example  the scottish parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters  save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied    but this power to legislate on what may be termed  devolved matters  is concurrent with the westminster parliament s general power to legislate for scotland on any matter at all  including devolved matters    in theory  therefore  westminster may legislate on scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses   
walker  g   2010    scotland  northern ireland  and devolution  19451979   journal of british studies  39  1   124   133    
gamble  a   the constitutional revolution in the united kingdom   publius  36  1   1935  p  29      the british parliament has the power to abolish the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses  but since both were sanctioned by referenda  it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people  in this way several of the constitutional measures introduced by the blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at westminster 
meehan  e   1999    the belfast agreementits distinctiveness and points of cross-fertilization in the uk s devolution programme   parliamentary affairs  52  1   1931  p  23     
distinctive involvement of two governments in the northern irish problem means that northern ireland s new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement  if this can be equated with a treaty  it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between westminster and belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states    although the agreement makes the general proviso that westminster s  powers to make legislation for northern ireland  remains  unaffected   without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters  it may be more difficult than in scotland or wales for devolved powers to be repatriated  the retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in northern ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement
