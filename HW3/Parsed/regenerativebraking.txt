a regenerative brake is an
mechanism which slows a vehicle or object by converting its
into a form which can be either used immediately or stored until needed  this contrasts with conventional braking systems  where the excess kinetic energy is converted to unwanted and wasted heat by friction in the   in addition to improving the overall efficiency of the vehicle  regeneration can greatly extend the life of the braking system as its parts do not wear as quickly

general  
the most common form of regenerative brake involves an
as an electric generator  in electric
the electricity generated is fed back into the   in
and
vehicles  the energy is stored chemically in a   electrically in a bank of   or mechanically in a rotating  
vehicles use hydraulic motors to store energy in the form of  
practical regenerative braking  
regenerative braking is not by itself sufficient as the sole means of safely bringing a vehicle to a standstill  or slowing it as required so it must be used in conjunction with another braking system such as -based braking 
the regenerative braking effect drops off at lower speeds  and cannot bring a vehicle to a complete halt reasonably quickly 
a regenerative brake does not immobilise a stationary vehicle 
is required  for example to prevent vehicles from rolling down hills 
many road vehicles with regenerative braking do not have drive motors on all wheels  as in a
car   regenerative braking is normally only applicable to wheels with motors  for safety  the ability to brake all wheels is required 
the regenerative braking effect available is limited  and insufficient in many cases  particularly in emergency situations 
the friction brake is a necessary back-up in the event of failure of the regenerative brake 
regenerative and friction braking must both be used  creating the need to control them to produce the required total braking  the gm
was the first commercial car to do this  in 1997 and 1998 engineers abraham farag and loren majersik were issued two patents for this
technology 
early applications commonly suffered from a serious safety hazard  in many early electric vehicles with regenerative braking  the same controller positions were used to apply power and to apply the regenerative brake  with the functions being swapped by a separate manual switch  this led to a number of serious accidents when drivers accidentally accelerated when intending to brake  such as the
accident in
in 1948  which killed twenty-one people 
conversion to electric energy  the motor as a generator  
a tesla model s p85  using regenerative braking power in excess of 60 kw  during regenerative braking the power indicator is green
  when used in reverse function as   convert mechanical energy into electrical energy  vehicles propelled by electric motors use them as generators when using regenerative braking  braking by transferring mechanical energy from the wheels to an electrical load 
early examples of this system were the
conversions of horse-drawn
by
in paris in the 1890s  the krieger electric
had a drive motor in each front wheel with a second set of parallel windings    for regenerative braking  in england  the raworth system of  regenerative control  was introduced by tramway operators in the early 1900s  since it offered them economic and operational benefits as explained by a  raworth of leeds in some detail  these included tramway systems at devonport  1903     birmingham  crystal palace-croydon  1906   and many others  slowing the speed of the cars or keeping it in control on descending gradients  the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles  the tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail  in several cases the tram car motors were shunt wound instead of series wound  and the systems on the crystal palace line utilized series-parallel controllers    following a serious accident at rawtenstall  an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911  the regenerative braking system was reintroduced 20 years later 
regenerative braking has been in extensive use on railways for many decades  the baku-tbilisi-batumi railway   or georgian railway  started utilizing regenerative braking in the early 1930s  this was especially effective on the steep and dangerous   in scandinavia the kiruna to narvik electrified railway carries iron ore on the steeply-graded route from the mines in   in the north of sweden  down to the port of
in norway to this day  the rail cars are full of thousands of tons of
on the way down to narvik  and these trains generate large amounts of electricity by regenerative braking  with a maximum recuperative braking force of 750  from
on the national border to the port of narvik  the trains use only a fifth of the power they regenerate  the regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border  any excess energy from the railway is pumped into the power grid to supply homes and businesses in the region  and the railway is a net generator of electricity 
electric cars used regenerative braking since the earliest experiments  but this was often a complex affair where the driver had to flip switches between various operational modes in order to use it  the
and the
were early examples  which used many switches and modes controlled by an expensive  black box  or  drum switch  as part of their electrical system  these  like the krieger design  could only practically be used on downhill portions of a trip  and had to be manually engaged 
improvements in electronics allowed this process to be fully automated  starting with 1967 s
experimental electric car  designed by gulton industries the motor controller automatically began battery charging when the brake pedal was applied  many modern hybrid and electric vehicles use this technique to extend the range of the battery pack  especially those using an ac drive train  most earlier designs used dc power  
electric railway vehicle operation  
in 1886 the sprague electric railway   motor company  founded by   introduced two important inventions  a constant-speed  non-sparking motor with fixed brushes  and regenerative braking 
during braking  the
connections are altered to turn them into electrical generators  the motor fields are connected across the main traction generator  mg  and the motor armatures are connected across the load  the mg now excites the motor fields  the rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the motor armatures  and the motors act as generators  either sending the generated current through onboard resistors    or back into the supply  regenerative braking   compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes  braking with the traction motors can be regulated faster improving the performance of  
for a given direction of travel  current flow through the motor armatures during braking will be opposite to that during motoring  therefore  the motor exerts
in a direction that is opposite from the rolling direction 
braking effort is proportional to the product of the magnetic strength of the field windings  multiplied by that of the armature windings 
savings of 17   and less wear on friction braking components  are claimed for
  the
reduced the amount of
 co
2  released into the atmosphere by around 90,000 tons by regenerating 112,500 megawatt hours of electricity through the use of regenerative braking systems between 2004 and 2007  it was expected that the delhi metro would reduce its emissions by over 100,000 tons of co
2 per year once its phase ii was complete  through the use of regenerative braking 
electricity generated by regenerative braking may be fed back into the traction power supply  either offset against other electrical demand on the network at that instant  used for
loads  or stored in
for later use 
a form of what can be described as regenerative braking is used on some parts of the   achieved by having small slopes leading up and down from stations  the train is slowed by the climb  and then leaves down a slope  so kinetic energy is converted to
in the station  this is normally found on the deep tunnel sections of the network and not generally above ground or on the
sections of the metropolitan and district lines 
comparison of dynamic and regenerative brakes  
the box extending sideways from the roof directly over the word  operation  allows air to freely flow through the resistors of the dynamic brakes on this diesel-electric locomotive 
what are described as dynamic brakes     in the uk  on electric traction systems  unlike regenerative brakes  dissipate electric energy as heat rather than using it  by passing the current through large banks of variable   vehicles that use dynamic brakes include  
  and   this heat can be used to warm the vehicle interior  or dissipated externally by large -like cowls to house the resistor banks 
general electric s experimental 1936
featured true regeneration  these two locomotives ran the steam water over the resistor packs  as opposed to air cooling used in most dynamic brakes  this energy displaced the oil normally burned to keep the water hot  and thereby recovered energy that could be used to accelerate again 
the main disadvantage of regenerative brakes when compared with dynamic brakes is the need to closely match the generated current with the supply characteristics and increased maintenance cost of the lines  with dc supplies  this requires that the voltage be closely controlled  the ac power supply and frequency converter pioneer miro zoric and his first ac power electronics have also enabled this to be possible with ac supplies  the supply frequency must also be matched  this mainly applies to locomotives where an ac supply is
for dc motors  
in areas where there is a constant need for power unrelated to moving the vehicle  such as electric train heat or   this load requirement can be utilized as a sink for the recovered energy via modern   this method has become popular with north american passenger railroads where
loads are typically in the area of 500kw year round  using hep loads in this way has prompted recent electric locomotive designs such as the
and
to eliminate the use of dynamic brake resistor grids and also eliminates any need for any external power infrastructure to accommodate power recovery allowing self-powered vehicles to employ regenerative braking as well 
a small number of
have used
power supplies and   this results in a near constant speed for all trains  as the motors rotate with the supply frequency both when driving and braking 
conversion to mechanical energy  
kinetic energy recovery systems  
main article 
kinetic energy recovery systems  kers  were used for the motor sport  s   and are under development for road vehicles  kers was abandoned for the 2010 formula one season  but re-introduced for the 2011 season  by 2013  all teams were using kers with marussia starting use for the 2013 season  one of the main reasons that not all cars used kers immediately is because it raises the car s center of gravity  and reduces the amount of
that is available to balance the car so that it is more predictable when turning  fia rules also limit the exploitation of the system  the concept of transferring the vehicles kinetic energy using
was postulated by physicist
in the 1950s   and is exemplified in such systems as the   flybrid  torotrak and xtrac used in f1 
based systems also exist such as the cambridge passenger commercial vehicle kinetic energy recovery system  cpc-kers  
xtrac and flybrid are both licensees of torotrak s technologies  which employ a small and sophisticated ancillary gearbox incorporating a
 cvt   the cpc-kers is similar as it also forms part of the driveline assembly  however  the whole mechanism including the flywheel sits entirely in the vehicles hub  looking like a drum brake   in the cpc-kers  a differential replaces the cvt and transfers torque between the   drive wheel and road wheel 
use in motor sport  
history  
a flybrid systems kinetic energy recovery system
the first of these systems to be revealed was the flybrid  this system weighs 24kg and has an energy capacity of 400 kj after allowing for internal losses  a maximum power boost of 60kw  81.6 ps  80.4 hp  for 6.67 seconds is available  the 240mm diameter flywheel weighs 5.0kg and revolves at up to 64,500 rpm  maximum torque is 18nm  13.3 ftlbs   the system occupies a volume of 13 litres   
two minor incidents have been reported during testing of kers systems in   the first occurred when the
team tested their kers battery for the first time in july  it malfunctioned and caused a fire scare that led to the team s factory being evacuated  the second was less than a week later when a
mechanic was given an electric shock when he touched  s kers-equipped car during a test at the
circuit 
fia  
a kers flywheel
have stated that they support responsible solutions to the world s environmental challenges  and the
allowed the use of 81hp  60kw  82ps  kers in the regulations for the   teams began testing systems in 2008  energy can either be stored as mechanical energy  as in a   or as electrical energy  as in a battery or   
with the introduction of kers in the 2009 season  four teams used it at some point in the season        and   during the season  renault and bmw stopped using the system 
became the first team to win a f1 gp using a kers equipped car when
won the hungarian grand prix on 26 july 2009  their second kers equipped car finished fifth  at the following race  lewis hamilton became the first driver to take pole position with a kers car  his team mate 
qualifying second  this was also the first instance of an all kers front row  on 30 august 2009 
won the belgian grand prix with his kers equipped ferrari  it was the first time that kers contributed directly to a race victory  with second placed
claiming  actually  i was quicker than kimi  he only took me because of kers at the beginning  
although kers was still legal in f1 in the 2010 season  all the teams had agreed not to use it  new rules for the 2011 f1 season which raised the minimum weight limit of the car and driver by 20kg to 640kg  along with the fota teams agreeing to the use of kers devices once more  meant that kers returned for the 2011 season  this is still optional as it was in the 2009 season  in the 2011 season 3 teams elected not to use it  for the 2012 season  only marussia and hrt raced without kers  and by 2013  with the withdrawal of hrt  all 11 teams on the grid were running kers 
for the 2014 season  the power output of the mgu-k  the replacement of the kers and part of the ers system that also includes a
waste heat recovery system  increased from 60kw to 120kw and it is allowed to recover 2
per lap  this was to balance the sport s move from 2.4 litre v8 engines to 1.6 litre v6 engines  the fail-safe settings of the
system that now supplements kers came under examination as a contributing factor in the crash of
at the 2014 japanese grand prix 
autopart makers  
motorsport service is developing a kers for use in motor racing  these electricity storage systems for hybrid and engine functions include a
with scalable capacity or a   a four to eight kilogram
 with a maximum power level of 60kw or 80hp   as well as the kers controller for power and battery management  bosch also offers a range of electric hybrid systems for commercial and light-duty applications 
carmakers  
automakers including
have been testing kers systems  at the   peugeot sport unveiled the   a
variant of the diesel 908  with kers  peugeot planned to campaign the car in the   although it was not capable of scoring championship points  peugeot plans also a compressed air regenerative braking powertrain called hybrid air 
began testing of their kers in september 2008 at the jerez test track in preparation for the 2009 f1 season  although at that time it was not yet known if they would be operating an electrical or mechanical system  in november 2008 it was announced that
would collaborate with
to further develop its kers for  s formula one car from 2010 onwards  both parties believed this collaboration would improve mclaren s kers system and help the system filter down to road car technology

hv-r hybrid race car that won the 24 hours of tokachi race in july 2007 
bmw has used regenerative braking on their e90 3 series as well as in current models like f25 5 series under the efficientdynamics moniker  volkswagen have regenerative braking technologies under the
brand in such models as the mk7 golf and mk7 golf estate   wagon models  other vw group brands like seat  skoda and audi 
motorcycles  
racing boss
has revealed that the factory raced with a secret kinetic energy recovery system  kers  fitted to  s motorcycle during the 2008 season-ending 125cc   this was against the rules  so they were banned from doing it afterwards 
bicycles  
regenerative braking is also possible on a non-electric bicycle  the   working with students from the university of michigan  developed the hydraulic regenerative brake launch assist  rbla   it is common on some
bicycles with   while it is not feasible with crank drive systems   it can be realised with so called direct drive hub motors  which means they do not have a
built in   
races  
  the organizer behind the annual
event and the
is currently  studying specific rules for
that will be equipped with a kinetic energy recovery system   peugeot was the first manufacturer to unveil a fully functioning lmp1 car in the form of the 908 hy at the 2008 autosport 1000km race at silverstone

is the change in energy of the flywheel 
an assumption is made that during braking there is no change in the potential energy  enthalpy of the flywheel  pressure or volume of the flywheel  so only kinetic energy will be considered  as the car is braking  no energy is dispersed by the flywheel  and the only energy into the flywheel is the initial kinetic energy of the car  the equation can be simplified to

is the initial velocity of the car just before braking 
the flywheel collects a percentage of the initial kinetic energy of the car  and this percentage can be represented by

f
l
y
  displaystyle  eta   fly  
  the flywheel stores the energy as rotational kinetic energy  because the energy is kept as kinetic energy and not transformed into another type of energy this process is efficient  the flywheel can only store so much energy  however  and this is limited by its maximum amount of rotational kinetic energy  this is determined based upon the inertia of the flywheel and its angular velocity  as the car sits idle  little rotational kinetic energy is lost over time so the initial amount of energy in the flywheel can be assumed to equal the final amount of energy distributed by the flywheel  the amount of kinetic energy distributed by the flywheel is therefore

regenerative brakes  
regenerative braking has a similar energy equation to the equation for the mechanical flywheel  regenerative braking is a two-step process involving the motor generator and the battery  the initial kinetic energy is transformed into electrical energy by the generator and is then converted into chemical energy by the battery  this process is less efficient than the flywheel  the efficiency of the generator can be represented by

as well as the battery are supposed to show an efficiency which is equal to 90   whereas the efficiency of power train is supposed to be equal to 80   in this case  the overal efficiency would amount to 58.3   which is very close to the value of 60  given by the  
the electric motor  and
are supposed to show an efficiency which is equal to 90   leading to an efficiency of 81   for recuperating such an amount  the car must know precisely when braking energy has to be recuperated  which is impossible  the recuperated amount will be lower  except maybe during braking cycles  which are known
