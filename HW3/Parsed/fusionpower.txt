by   as of january 2016  these technologies were not viable  as they cannot produce more energy than is required to initiate and sustain a fusion reaction

binding energy for different atoms  iron-56 has the highest  making it the most stable  atoms to the left are likely to fuse  atoms to the right are likely to split 
mechanism  
fusion reactions occur when two  or more  atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the
pulling them together exceeds the
pushing them apart  fusing them into heavier nuclei  for nuclei lighter than   the reaction is   releasing energy  for nuclei heavier than iron-56  the reaction is   requiring an external source of energy  hence  nuclei smaller than iron-56 are more likely to fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart 
the strong force acts only over short distances  the repulsive electrostatic force acts over longer distances  so
is needed to overcome this    before the reaction can take place  way of doing this include speeding up atoms in a   or heating them to high temperatures 
once an atom is heated above its
energy  its
are stripped away  it is ionized   leaving just the bare nucleus  the    the result is a hot cloud of ions and the electrons formerly attached to them  this cloud is known as a   because the charges are separated  plasmas are electrically conductive and magnetically controllable  many fusion devices take advantage of this to control the particles as they are heated 
cross section  
the fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off  the deuterium-tritium fusion rate peaks at a lower temperature  about 70kev  or 800 million kelvin  and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy 
a reaction s   denoted   is the measure of the probability that a fusion reaction will happen  this depends on the relative velocity of the two nuclei  higher relative velocities increase the probability  cross sections for many fusion reactions were measured  mainly in the 1970s  using  
in a plasma  particle velocity can be characterized using a probability distribution  if the plasma is thermalized  the distribution looks like a   or   in this case  it is useful to take the average cross section over the velocity distribution  this is entered into the volumetric fusion rate

lawson criterion  
the lawson criterion shows how energy varies with temperature  density  speed of collision and fuel  this equation was central to john lawson s analysis of fusion working with a hot plasma  lawson assumed an   shown below 
net power   efficiency    fusion - radiation loss - conduction loss 
net power is the net power for any fusion power station 
efficiency how much energy is needed to drive the device and how well it collects power 
fusion is rate of energy generated by the fusion reactions 
radiation is the energy lost as light  leaving the plasma 
conduction is the energy lost  as momentum leaves the plasma 
plasma clouds lose energy through
and   conduction occurs when  
or
impact a surface and transfer a portion of their kinetic energy to the atoms of the surface  radiation is energy that leaves the cloud as light in the visible      or
spectra  radiation increases with temperature  fusion power technologies must overcome these losses 
triple product  density  temperature  time  
the lawson criterion argues that a machine holding a
 hot  and quasi- plasma has to meet basic criteria to overcome
losses 
losses and reach efficiency of 30 percent  this became known as the  triple product   the plasma density  temperature and confinement time  attempts to increase the triple product led to targeting larger plants  larger plants move structural materials further away from the centre of the plasma  which reduces conduction and radiation losses since more of the radiation is internally reflected  this emphasis on

plasma behavior  
plasma is an ionized gas that conducts electricity  in bulk  it is modeled using   which is a combination of the
equations governing fluids and
governing how magnetic and electric fields behave  fusion exploits several plasma properties  including 
self-organizing plasma conducts electric and magnetic fields  its motions can generate fields that can in turn contain it 
can generate its own internal magnetic field  this can reject an externally applied magnetic field  making it diamagnetic 
can reflect plasma when it moves from a low to high density field 
energy capture  
multiple approaches have been proposed for energy capture  the simplest is to heat a fluid  the neutrons generated by fusion can re-generate a spent fission fuel 
was developed  at
in the 1980s  as a method to maintain a voltage using the fusion reaction products  this has demonstrated energy capture efficiency of 48 percent 
approaches  
magnetic confinement  
  the most well-developed and well-funded approach to fusion energy  this method races hot plasma around in a magnetically confined  donut-shaped ring  with an internal current  when completed 
will be the world s largest tokamak  as of april 2012 an estimated 215 experimental tokamaks were either planned  decommissioned or currently operating  35  worldwide 
  a variation on the tokamak with a spherical shape 
  twisted rings of hot plasma  the stellarator attempts to create a natural twist plasma path  using external magnets  while tokamaks create those magnetic fields using an internal current  stellarators were developed by
in 1950 and have four designs  torsatron  heliotron  heliac and helias  one example is   a german fusion device that produced its first plasma on december 10  2015  it is the world s largest stellarator  designed to investigate the suitability of this type of device for a power station 
  these use a solid superconducting torus  this is magnetically levitated inside the reactor chamber  the superconductor forms an axisymmetric magnetic field that contains the plasma  the ldx was developed by mit and columbia university after 2000 by jay kesner and michael e  mauel 
  developed by
and teams at
in the 1960s  magnetic mirrors reflected hot plasma back and forth in a line  variations included the magnetic bottle and the   a series of well-funded  large  mirror machines were built by the us government in the 1970s and 1980s 
  this device traps plasma in a self-organized quasi-stable structure  where the particle motion makes an internal magnetic field which then traps itself 
  here the plasma moves inside a ring  it has an internal magnetic field  moving out from the center of this ring  the magnetic field reverses direction 
inertial confinement  
  in this technique  lasers directly blast a pellet of fuel  the goal is to ignite a fusion chain reaction  ignition was first suggested by john nuckolls  in 1972  notable direct drive experiments have been conducted at the  
and the
facilities  good implosions require fuel pellets with close to a perfect shape in order to generate a symmetrical inward
that produces the high-density plasma 
fast ignition  this method uses two laser blasts  the first blast compresses the fusion fuel  while the second high energy pulse ignites it  experiments have been conducted at the
using the omega and omega ep systems and at the gekko xii laser at the institute for laser engineering in osaka japan 
  in this technique  lasers blasts a structure around the pellet of fuel  this structure is known as a   as it disintegrates the pellet is bathed in a more uniform
light  creating better compression  the largest system using this method is the  
or   this combines a laser pulse with a magnetic pinch  the pinch community refers to it as magnetized liner inertial fusion while the icf community refers to it as magneto-inertial fusion 
heavy ion beams there are also proposals to do inertial confinement fusion with ion beams instead of laser beams  the main difference is the mass of the beam has momentum  whereas lasers do not 
magnetic or electric pinches  
main article 
  this method sends a strong current  in the z-direction  through the plasma  the current generates a magnetic field that squeezes the plasma to fusion conditions  pinches were the first method for man-made controlled fusion  some examples include the
and the
at  
theta-pinch  this method sends a current inside a plasma  in the theta direction 
screw pinch  this method combines a theta and z-pinch for improved stabilization 
inertial electrostatic confinement  
  this method uses an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions  the machine typically uses two spherical cages  a cathode inside the anode  inside a vacuum  these machines are not considered a viable approach to net power because of their high
and
losses  they are simple enough to build that amateurs have fused atoms using them 
  this designs attempts to combine magnetic confinement with electrostatic fields  to avoid the
losses generated by the cage 
other  
  this method confines hot plasma using a magnetic field and squeezes it using inertia  examples include
frx-l machine 
and the plasma liner experiment 
  fusion has been initiated by man  using uncontrolled fission explosions to ignite so-called hydrogen bombs  early proposals for fusion power included using bombs to initiate reactions 
beam fusion  a beam of high energy particles can be fired at another beam or target and fusion will occur  this was used in the 1970s and 1980s to study the cross sections of high energy fusion reactions 
  this was a fusion reaction that was supposed to occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles  created during acoustic liquid cavitation  this approach was discredited 
  this is a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction that would occur at  or near  room temperature  cold fusion is discredited and gained a reputation as  
  muons allow atoms to get much closer and thus reduce the kinetic energy required to initiate fusion  muons require more energy to produce than can be obtained from muon-catalysed fusion  making this approach impractical for power generation 
  also known as
argues that a majority of available fusion fuels exists within the sphere of the sun where it is gravitationally confined  and that a tractable way to accomplish large-scale fusion power is to build very large space-borne platforms that capture energy via photons rather than via a   the theoretical limit of power via this means is a
via a
common tools  
heating  
gas must be first heated to form a plasma  this then needs to be hot enough to start fusion reactions  a number of heating schemes have been explored 
a radio wave is applied to the plasma  causing it to oscillate  this is basically the same concept as a   this is also known as
or    
an electric field can do
on charged ions or electrons  heating them 
an external source of hydrogen is ionized and accelerated by an electric field to form a charged beam which is shone through a source of neutral hydrogen gas towards the plasma which itself is ionized and contained in the reactor by a magnetic field  some of the intermediate hydrogen gas is accelerated towards the plasma by collisions with the charged beam while remaining neutral  this neutral beam is thus unaffected by the magnetic field and so shines through it into the plasma  once inside the plasma the neutral beam transmits energy to the plasma by collisions as a result of which it becomes ionized and thus contained by the magnetic field thereby both heating and refuelling the reactor in one operation  the remainder of the charged beam is diverted by magnetic fields onto cooled beam dumps 
magnetic oscillations
measurement  
light scatters from plasma  this light can be detected and used to reconstruct the plasmas  behavior  this technique can be used to find its density and temperature  it is common in  
and   in icf systems  this can be done by firing a second beam into a gold foil adjacent to the target  this makes x-rays that scatter or traverse the plasma  in tokamaks  this can be done using mirrors and detectors to reflect light across a plane  two dimensions  or in a line  one dimension  
this is a metal object placed in a plasma  a potential is applied to it  giving it a positive or negative
against the surrounding plasma  the metal collects charged particles  drawing a current  as the voltage changes  the current changes  this makes a   the iv-curve can be used to determine the local plasma density  potential and temperature 
deuterium or tritium fusion produces neutrons  geiger counters record the rate of neutron production  so they are an essential tool for demonstrating success 
a loop of wire is inserted into the magnetic field  as the field passes through the loop  a current is made  the current is measured and used to find the total magnetic flux through that loop  this has been used on the   the
and the
machines 
all plasma loses energy by emitting light  this covers the whole spectrum  visible  ir  uv  and x-rays  this occurs anytime a particle changes speed 
if the reason is deflection by a magnetic field  the radiation is
radiation at low speeds and
radiation at high speeds  if the reason is deflection by another particle  plasma radiates x-rays  known as
radiation  x-rays are termed in both hard and soft  based on their energy 
power production  
it has been proposed
that steam turbines be used to convert the heat from the fusion chamber into electricity  the heat is transferred into a
that turns into steam  driving electric generators 
neutron blankets deuterium and tritium fusion generates   this varies by technique  nif has a record of 3e14 neutrons per second while a typical
produces 1e51e9 neutrons per second   it has been proposed to use these neutrons as a way to regenerate spent fission fuel
or as a way to breed tritium from a liquid lithium blanket 
this is a method where the
of a particle is converted into   it was first suggested by
in conjunction with   in the late sixties  it has also been suggested for   the process takes the plasma  expands it  and converts a large fraction of the random energy of the fusion products into directed motion  the particles are then collected on electrodes at various large electrical potentials  this method has demonstrated an experimental efficiency of 48 percent 
confinement  
parameter space occupied by
and
devices as of the mid 1990s  the regime allowing thermonuclear ignition with high gain lies near the upper right corner of the plot 
confinement refers to all the conditions necessary to keep a plasma dense and hot long enough to undergo fusion  here are some general principles 
  the forces acting on the plasma must be balanced for containment  one exception is   where the relevant physics must occur faster than the disassembly time 
  the plasma must be so constructed so that disturbances will not lead to the plasma disassembling 
transport or   the loss of material must be sufficiently slow  the plasma carries off energy with it  so rapid loss of material will disrupt any machines power balance  material can be lost by transport into different regions or
through a solid or liquid 
to produce self-sustaining fusion  the energy released by the reaction  or at least a fraction of it  must be used to heat new reactant nuclei and keep them hot long enough that they also undergo fusion reactions 
unconfined  
the first human-made  large-scale fusion reaction was the test of the     in 1952  as part of the
project  it was once proposed to use hydrogen bombs as a source of power by detonating them in underground caverns and then generating electricity from the heat produced  but such a power station is unlikely ever to be constructed 
magnetic confinement  
at the temperatures required for fusion  the fuel is heated to a plasma state  in this state it has a very good   this opens the possibility of confining the plasma with   this is the case of magnetized plasma  where the magnetic fields and plasma intermix  this is generally known as   the field lines put a
on the plasma  the force works perpendicular to the magnetic fields  so one problem in magnetic confinement is preventing the plasma from leaking out the ends of the field lines  a general measure of magnetic trapping in fusion is the beta ratio

magnetic mirror one example of magnetic confinement is with the
effect  if a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength  the particles can be reflected  there are several devices that try to use this effect  the most famous was the magnetic mirror machines  which was a series of large  expensive devices built at the
from the 1960s to mid 1980s  some other examples include the magnetic bottles and   because the mirror machines were straight  they had some advantages over a ring shape  first  mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second
energy capture  was easier to implement  as the confinement achieved in experiments was poor  this approach was abandoned   
magnetic loops another example of magnetic confinement is to bend the field lines back on themselves  either in circles or more commonly in nested
surfaces  the most highly developed system of this type is the   with the
being next most advanced  followed by the     especially the
and the   attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a
 non-toroidal  machine  resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area 
inertial confinement  
is the use of rapidly imploding shell to heat and confine plasma  the shell is imploded using a direct laser blast  direct drive  or a secondary x-ray blast  indirect drive  or heavy ion beams  theoretically  fusion using lasers would be done using tiny pellets of fuel that explode several times a second  to induce the explosion  the pellet must be compressed to about 30 times solid density with energetic beams  if direct drive is usedthe beams are focused directly on the pelletit can in principle be very efficient  but in practice is difficult to obtain the needed uniformity  the alternative approach  indirect drive  uses beams to heat a shell  and then the shell radiates   which then implode the pellet  the beams are commonly laser beams  but heavy and light
and electron beams have all been investigated 
electrostatic confinement  
there are also
devices  these devices confine
using electrostatic fields  the best known is the   this device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage  positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage  and are heated by the electric field in the process  if they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse  ions typically hit the cathode  however  creating prohibitory high
losses  also  fusion rates in
are very low because of competing physical effects  such as energy loss in the form of light radiation  designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage  by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud  these include a plasma oscillating device  a

1920s  
research into nuclear fusion started in the early part of the 20th century  in 1920 the british physicist
discovered that the total mass equivalent of four
 two protons and two neutrons  are heavier than the total mass of one
    which implied that net energy can be released by combining hydrogen atoms together to form helium  and provided the first hints of a mechanism by which stars could produce energy in the quantities being measured  through the 1920s 
became a major proponent of the
 pp reaction  as the primary system running the  
1930s  
a theory was verified by
in 1939 showing that
and
in the
might convert one of the protons into a
and thereby producing
rather than a diproton  the deuterium would then fuse through other reactions to further increase the energy output  for this work  bethe won the  
1940s  
in 1942  nuclear fusion research was subsumed into the
when the
surrounding the field obscured by the science  the first patent related to a fusion reactor was registered in 1946 by the   the inventors were
and   this was the first detailed examination of the
concept 
z-pinch is based on the fact that plasmas are electrically conducting  running a current through the plasma  will generate a magnetic field around the plasma  this field will  according to   create an inward directed force that causes the plasma to collapse inward  raising its density  denser plasmas generate denser magnetic fields  increasing the inward force  leading to a   if the conditions are correct  this can lead to the densities and temperatures needed for fusion  the difficulty is getting the current into the plasma  which would normally melt any sort of mechanical   a solution emerges again because of the conducting nature of the plasma  by placing the plasma in the middle of an  
can be used to generate the current 
starting in 1947  two uk teams carried out small experiments and began building a series of ever-larger experiments  when the huemul results hit the news  see below     a uk physicist working at los alamos  introduced the pinch concept in the us and produced a series of machines known as the   the soviet union  unbeknownst to the west  was also building a series of similar machines  all of these devices quickly demonstrated a series of instabilities when the pinch was applied  this broke up the plasma column long before it reached the densities and temperatures required for fusion 
1950s  
the first man-made device to achieve
was the detonation of this fusion device  codenamed  
early photo of plasma inside a pinch machine  imperial college 1950/1951 
the first successful man-made fusion device was the
tested in 1951 in the
test  this was followed by true fusion weapons in 1952 s   and the first practical examples in 1954 s   this was uncontrolled fusion  in these devices  the energy released by the fission explosion is used to compress and heat fusion fuel  starting a fusion reaction  fusion releases   these
hit the surrounding fission fuel  causing the atoms to split apart much faster than normal fission processesalmost instantly by comparison  this increases the effectiveness of bombs  normal fission weapons blow themselves apart before all their fuel is used  fusion fission weapons do not have this practical upper limit 
in 1949 an expatriate german    proposed the
in argentina  announcing positive results in 1951  these turned out to be fake  but it prompted considerable interest in the concept as a whole  in particular  it prompted
to begin considering ways to solve some of the more obvious problems involved in confining a hot plasma  and  unaware of the z-pinch efforts  he developed a new solution to the problem known as the   spitzer applied to the us
for funding to build a test device  during this period 
who had worked with the uk teams had been introducing the z-pinch concept to his coworkers at his new job at
 lanl   when he heard of spitzer s pitch for funding  he applied to build a machine of his own  the  
spitzer s idea won funding and he began work on the stellarator under the code name project matterhorn  his work led to the creation of the   tuck returned to lanl and arranged local funding to build his machine  by this time  however  it was clear that all of the pinch machines were suffering from the same issues involving stability  and progress stalled  in 1953  tuck and others suggested a number of solutions to the stability problems  this led to the design of a second series of pinch machines  led by the uk
and
devices 
spitzer had planned an aggressive development project of four machines  a  b  c  and d  a and b were small research devices  c would be the prototype of a power-producing machine  and d would be the prototype of a commercial device  a worked without issue  but even by the time b was being used it was clear the stellarator was also suffering from instabilities and plasma leakage  progress on c slowed as attempts were made to correct for these problems 
by the mid-1950s it was clear that the simple theoretical tools being used to calculate the performance of all fusion machines were simply not predicting their actual behavior  machines invariably leaked their plasma from their confinement area at rates far higher than predicted  in 1954 
held a gathering of fusion researchers at the princeton gun club  near the project matterhorn  now known as   grounds  teller started by pointing out the problems that everyone was having  and suggested that any system where the plasma was confined within concave fields was doomed to fail  attendees remember him saying something to the effect that the fields were like rubber bands  and they would attempt to snap back to a straight configuration whenever the power was increased  ejecting the plasma  he went on to say that it appeared the only way to confine the plasma in a stable configuration would be to use convex fields  a  cusp  configuration 
when the meeting concluded  most of the researchers quickly turned out papers saying why teller s concerns did not apply to their particular device  the pinch machines did not use magnetic fields in this way at all  while the mirror and stellarator seemed to have various ways out  this was soon followed by a paper by
and
discussing pinch machines  however  which demonstrated instabilities in those devices were inherent to the design 
the largest  classic  pinch device was the   including all of these suggested upgrades  starting operations in the uk in 1957  in early 1958 
announced that fusion had been achieved in the zeta  an announcement that made headlines around the world  when physicists in the us expressed concerns about the claims they were initially dismissed  us experiments soon demonstrated the same neutrons  although temperature measurements suggested these could not be from fusion reactions  the neutrons seen in the uk were later demonstrated to be from different versions of the same instability processes that plagued earlier machines  cockcroft was forced to retract the fusion claims  and the entire field was tainted for years  zeta ended its experiments in 1968 
the first controlled fusion experiment was accomplished using scylla i at the
in 1958  this was a pinch machine  with a cylinder full of deuterium  electric current shot down the sides of the cylinder  the current made magnetic fields that compressed the plasma to 15 million degrees celsius  squeezed the gas  fused it and produced neutrons 
in 19501951
and
in the   first discussed a -like approach  experimental research on those designs began in 1956 at the
in
by a group of soviet scientists led by   the tokamak essentially combined a low-power pinch device with a low-power simple stellarator  the key was to combine the fields in such a way that the particles orbited within the reactor a particular number of times  today known as the     the combination of these fields dramatically improved confinement times and densities  resulting in huge improvements over existing devices 
1960s  
a key plasma physics text was published by
at princeton in 1963  spitzer took the ideal gas laws and adopted them to an ionized plasma  developing many of the fundamental equations used to model a plasma 
laser fusion was suggested in 1962 by scientists at   shortly after the invention of the laser itself in 1960  at the time  lasers were low power machines  but low-level research began as early as 1965  laser fusion  formally known as   involves
a target by using
beams  there are two ways to do this  indirect drive and direct drive  in direct drive  the laser blasts a pellet of fuel  in indirect drive  the lasers blast a structure around the fuel  this makes
that squeeze the fuel  both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place 
at the   the public was given its first demonstration of nuclear fusion  the device was a -pinch from general electric  this was similar to the scylla machine developed earlier at los alamos 
the
was first published in 1967 by
and many others at the lawrence livermore national laboratory  the mirror consisted of two large magnets arranged so they had strong fields within them  and a weaker  but connected  field between them  plasma introduced in the area between the two magnets would  bounce back  from the stronger fields in the middle 
the
group constructed the first tokamaks  the most successful being the
and its larger version   t-4 was tested in 1968 in   producing the world s first quasistationary fusion reaction  when this were first announced  the international community was highly skeptical  a british team was invited to see t-3  however  and after measuring it in depth they released their results that confirmed the soviet claims  a burst of activity followed as many planned devices were abandoned and new tokamaks were introduced in their place  the c model stellarator  then under construction after many redesigns  was quickly converted to the symmetrical tokamak 
in his work with vacuum tubes 
observed that electric charge would accumulate in regions of the tube  today  this effect is known as the   farnsworth reasoned that if ions were concentrated high enough they could collide and fuse  in 1962  he filed a patent on a design using a positive inner cage to concentrate plasma  in order to achieve nuclear fusion  during this time 
joined the farnsworth television labs and began work on what became the fusor  hirsch patented the design in 1966 and published the design in 1967

during this time  great strides in understanding the tokamak system were made  a number of improvements to the design are now part of the  advanced tokamak  concept  which includes non-circular plasma  internal diverters and limiters  often superconducting magnets  and operate in the so-called  h-mode  island of increased stability  two other designs have also become fairly well studied  the compact tokamak is wired with the magnets on the inside of the vacuum chamber  while the
reduces its cross section as much as possible 
in 1974 a study of the zeta results demonstrated an interesting side-effect  after an experimental run ended  the plasma would enter a short period of stability  this led to the
concept  which has seen some level of development since  on may 1  1974  the kms fusion company  founded by   achieves the world s first laser induced fusion in a deuterium-tritium pellet 
in the mid-1970s    carried out at los alamos national laboratory  lanl  explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small
 fusion bombs  inside an underground cavity  as an energy source  the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology  it would also require a large  continuous supply of nuclear bombs  however  making the economics of such a system rather questionable

inertial confinement fusion implosion on the
during the 1980s was a key driver of fusion development 
as a result of advocacy  the cold war  and the
a massive
program was funded by the us federal government in the late 1970s and early 1980s  this program resulted in a series of large magnetic mirror devices including  2x  baseball i  baseball ii  the   the tandem mirror experiment upgrade  the

cost 372 million dollars and was  at that time  the most expensive project in livermore history  it opened on february 21  1986 and was promptly shut down  the reason given was to balance the united states federal budget  this program was supported from within the carter and early reagan administrations by   a us navy captain  under  
in laser fusion progressed  in 1983  the
was completed  the following december 1984  the ten beam
was finished  five years later  nova would produce a maximum of 120 kilojoules of infrared light  during a nanosecond pulse    meanwhile  efforts focused on either fast delivery or beam smoothness  both tried to deliver the energy uniformly to implode the target  one early problem was that the light in the
wavelength  lost lots of energy before hitting the fuel  breakthroughs were made at the
at the   rochester scientists used frequency-tripling crystals to transform the infrared laser beams into ultraviolet beams  in 1985 
and
invented a method to amplify lasers pulses by  chirping   this method changes a single wavelength into a full spectrum  the system then amplifies the laser at each wavelength and then reconstitutes the beam into one color  chirp pulsed amplification became instrumental in building the national ignition facility and the omega ep system  most research into icf was towards weapons research  because the implosion is relevant to nuclear weapons 
during this time
constructed a series of laser facilities  this included gemini  a two beam system   helios  eight beams   antares  24 beams  and aurora  96 beams   the program ended in the early nineties with a cost on the order of one billion dollars 
in 1987  akira hasegawa
noticed that in a dipolar magnetic field  fluctuations tended compress the plasma without energy loss  this effect was noticed in data taken by   when it encountered uranus  this observation would become the basis for a fusion approach known as the

a soviet tokamak was completed  it was the first industrial fusion reactor to use
magnets to control the plasma  these were helium cooled 
in 1989  pons and fleischmann submitted papers to the journal of electroanalytical chemistry claiming that they had observed fusion in a room temperature device and disclosing their work in a press release  some scientists reported excess heat  neutrons  tritium  helium and other nuclear effects in so-called
systems  which for a time gained interest as showing promise  hopes fell when replication failures were weighed in view of several reasons cold fusion is not likely to occur  the discovery of possible sources of experimental error  and finally the discovery that fleischmann and pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts  by late 1989  most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead  and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as   however  a small community of researchers continues to investigate cold fusion claiming to replicate fleishmann and pons  results including nuclear reaction byproducts  claims related to cold fusion are largely disbelieved in the mainstream scientific community  in 1989  the majority of a review panel organized by the
 doe  found that the evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process was not persuasive  a second doe review  convened in 2004 to look at new research  reached conclusions similar to the first 
in 1984  martin peng of ornl proposed an alternate arrangement of the magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak  a   instead of wiring each magnet coil separately  he proposed using a single large conductor in the center  and wiring the magnets as half-rings off of this conductor  what was once a series of individual rings passing through the hole in the center of the reactor was reduced to a single post  allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2  the st concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design  however  it was being proposed during a period when us fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back  ornl was provided with funds to develop a suitable central column built out of a high-strength copper alloy called  glidcop   however  they were unable to secure funding to build a demonstration machine   stx   failing to build an st at ornl  peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the st concept and get a test machine built  one way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the

 fast ignition  was developed in the late nineties  and was part of a push by the

fuels  
by firing particle beams at targets  many fusion reactions have been tested  while the fuels considered for power have all been light elements like the isotopes of hydrogen and   other reactions like the deuterium and helium3 reaction or the helium3 and helium3 reactions  would require a supply of helium3  this can either come from other nuclear reactions or from extraterrestrial sources  finally  researchers hope to do the p-11b reaction  because it does not directly produce neutrons  though side reactions can

2he  
this reaction is common in research  industrial and military applications  usually as a convenient source of neutrons 
is a naturally occurring
of hydrogen and is commonly available  the large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the difficult
process 
is a natural isotope of hydrogen  but because it has a short
of 12.32 years  it is hard to find  store  produce  and is expensive  consequently  the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle requires the
of
from
using one of the following reactions

0n
the reactant neutron is supplied by the d-t fusion reaction shown above  and the one that has the greatest yield of energy  the reaction with 6li is   providing a small energy gain for the reactor  the reaction with 7li is
but does not consume the neutron  at least some 7li reactions are required to replace the neutrons lost to absorption by other elements  most reactor designs use the naturally occurring mix of lithium isotopes 
several drawbacks are commonly attributed to d-t fusion power 
it produces substantial amounts of neutrons that result in the
of the reactor materials 
only about 20  of the fusion energy yield appears in the form of charged particles with the remainder carried off by neutrons  which limits the extent to which direct energy conversion techniques might be applied 
it requires the handling of the radioisotope tritium  similar to hydrogen  tritium is difficult to contain and may leak from reactors in some quantity  some estimates suggest that this would represent a fairly large environmental release of radioactivity 
the
expected in a commercial d-t fusion reactor is about 100 times that of current fission power reactors  posing problems for   after a series of d-t tests at   the vacuum vessel was sufficiently radioactive that remote handling was required for the year following the tests 
in a production setting  the neutrons would be used to react with
in order to create more tritium  this also deposits the energy of the neutrons in the lithium  which would then be transferred to drive electrical production  the lithium neutron absorption reaction protects the outer portions of the reactor from the neutron flux  newer designs  the advanced tokamak in particular  also use lithium inside the reactor core as a key element of the design  the plasma interacts directly with the lithium  preventing a problem known as  recycling   the advantage of this design was demonstrated in the  
deuterium  
deuterium fusion cross section  in square meters  at different ion collision energies 
this is the second easiest fusion reaction  fusing deuterium with itself  the reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability 
d   d

  1h
d   d
 3he
  n
this reaction is also common in research  the optimum energy to initiate this reaction is 15kev  only slightly higher than the optimum for the d-t reaction  the first branch does not produce neutrons  but it does produce tritium  so that a d-d reactor will not be completely tritium-free  even though it does not require an input of tritium or lithium  unless the tritons can be quickly removed  most of the tritium produced would be burned before leaving the reactor  which would reduce the handling of tritium  but would produce more neutrons  some of which are very energetic  the neutron from the second branch has an energy of only 2.45mev  0.393pj   whereas the neutron from the d-t reaction has an energy of 14.1mev  2.26pj   resulting in a wider range of isotope production and material damage  when the tritons are removed quickly while allowing the 3he to react  the fuel cycle is called  tritium suppressed fusion  the removed tritium decays to 3he with a 12.5 year half life  by recycling the 3he produced from the decay of tritium back into the fusion reactor  the fusion reactor does not require materials resistant to fast 14.1mev  2.26pj  neutrons 
assuming complete tritium burn-up  the reduction in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18   so that the primary advantage of the d-d fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required  other advantages are independence from scarce     lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum  the disadvantage of d-d compared to d-t is that the energy confinement time  at a given pressure  must be 30 times longer and the power produced  at a given pressure and volume  would be 68 times less    
assuming complete removal of tritium and recycling of 3he  only 6  of the fusion energy is carried by neutrons  the tritium-suppressed d-d fusion requires an energy confinement that is 10 times longer compared to d-t and a plasma temperature that is twice as high

this reaction produces a helium-4 nucleus  4he  and a high-energy proton  as with the p-11b
fuel cycle  most of the reaction energy is released as charged particles  reducing
of the reactor housing and potentially allowing more efficient energy harvesting  via any of several speculative technologies     in practice  d-d side reactions produce a significant number of neutrons  resulting in p-11b being the preferred cycle for aneutronic fusion

if
is the goal  then the most promising candidate may be the hydrogen-1  proton   reaction  which releases alpha  helium  particles  but does not rely on
for energy transfer 
1h   11b  34he
under reasonable assumptions  side reactions will result in about 0.1  of the fusion power being carried by neutrons  at 123 kev  the optimum temperature for this reaction is nearly ten times higher than that for the pure hydrogen reactions  the energy confinement must be 500 times better than that required for the d-t reaction  and the
will be 2500 times lower than for d-t 
because the confinement properties of conventional approaches to fusion such as the tokamak and laser pellet fusion are marginal  most proposals for aneutronic fusion are based on radically different confinement concepts  such as the
and the   results have been extremely promising 
 in the october 2013 edition of nature communications  a research team led by christine labaune at cole polytechnique in palaiseau  france  reported a new record fusion rate  an estimated 80 million fusion reactions during the 1.5 nanoseconds that the laser fired  which is at least 100 times more than any previous proton-boron experiment   
material selection  
main article 
considerations  
any power station using hot plasma  is going to have plasma facing walls  in even the simplest plasma approaches  the material will get blasted with matter and energy  this leads to a minimum list of considerations  including dealing with 
a heating and cooling cycle  up to a 10mw m thermal load 
  which over time leads to
and  
high energy ions leaving at tens to hundreds of  
leaving at millions of  
electrons leaving at high energy 
light radiation  ir  visible  uv  x-ray  
depending on the approach  these effects may be higher or lower than typical
reactors like the
 pwr   one estimate put the
at 100 times the  pwr     materials need to be selected or developed that can withstand these basic conditions  depending on the approach  however  there may be other considerations such as  
and mechanical strength  there is also a need for materials whose primary components and impurities do not result in long-lived radioactive wastes 
durability  
for long term use  each atom in the wall is expected to be hit by a neutron and displaced about a hundred times before the material is replaced  high-energy neutrons will produce hydrogen and helium by way of various nuclear reactions that tends to form bubbles at grain boundaries and result in swelling  blistering or embrittlement 
selection  
one can choose either a low- material  such as
or   or a high- material  usually
with
as a second choice  use of liquid metals  lithium  gallium  tin  has also been proposed  e g   by injection of 15mm thick streams flowing at 10m s on solid substrates   
if graphite is used  the gross erosion rates due to physical and chemical
would be many meters per year  so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material  the location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with the location of the sputtering  so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive  an even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite  the tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms  representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident  the consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite  although a very attractive material for fusion experiments  cannot be the primary pfc material in a commercial reactor 
the sputtering rate of tungsten by the plasma fuel ions is orders of magnitude smaller than that of carbon  and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten  making this a more attractive choice  on the other hand  tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities  and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high  so it will be necessary to ensure that the plasma in contact with the tungsten is not too hot  a few tens of ev rather than hundreds of ev   tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events  as well as some radiological issues 
safety and the environment  
accident potential  
nuclear fusion is unlike nuclear fission  fusion requires extremely precise and controlled temperature  pressure and magnetic field parameters for any net energy to be produced  if a reactor suffers damage or loses even a small degree of required control  fusion reactions and heat generation would rapidly cease  additionally  fusion reactors contain relatively small amounts of fuel  enough to  burn  for minutes  or in some cases  microseconds  unless they are actively refueled  the reactions will quickly end  therefore  fusion reactors are considered extremely safe 
runaway reactions cannot occur in a fusion reactor  the
is burnt at optimal conditions  and any significant change will quench the reactions  the reaction process is so delicate that this level of safety is inherent  although the plasma in a fusion power station is expected to have a volume of 1,000 cubic metres  35,000cuft  or more  the plasma density is low and the total amount of fusion fuel in the vessel typically only a few grams  if the fuel supply is closed  the reaction stops within seconds  in comparison  a fission reactor is typically loaded with enough fuel for several months or years  and no additional fuel is necessary to continue the reaction  it is this large amount of fuel that gives rise to the possibility of a meltdown  nothing analogous exists in a fusion reactor 
in the magnetic approach  strong fields are developed in coils that are held in place mechanically by the reactor structure  failure of this structure could release this tension and allow the magnet to  explode  outward  the severity of this event would be similar to any other industrial accident or an
machine quench explosion  and could be effectively stopped with a
similar to those used in existing  fission  nuclear generators  the laser-driven inertial approach is generally lower-stress because of the increased size of the reaction chamber  although failure of the reaction chamber is possible  simply stopping fuel delivery would prevent any sort of catastrophic failure 
most reactor designs rely on liquid hydrogen as both a coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into   which is fed back into the reactor as fuel  hydrogen is highly flammable  and in the case of a fire it is possible that the hydrogen stored on-site could be burned up and escape  in this case  the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere  posing a radiation risk  calculations suggest that at about 1kg the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station would be so small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time they blew as far as the station s  
the likelihood of small industrial accidents including the local release of radioactivity and injury to staff cannot be estimated yet  these would include accidental releases of lithium or tritium or mis-handling of decommissioned radioactive components of the reactor itself 
magnet quench  
a quench is an abnormal termination of magnet operation that occurs when part of the superconducting coil enters the normal    state  this can occur because the field inside the magnet is too large  the rate of change of field is too large  causing
and resultant
in the copper support matrix   or a combination of the two 
more rarely a defect in the magnet can cause a quench  when this happens  that particular spot is subject to rapid
from the enormous current  which raises the
of the surrounding regions  this pushes those regions into the normal state as well  which leads to more heating in a chain reaction  the entire magnet rapidly becomes normal  this can take several seconds  depending on the size of the superconducting coil   this is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat  and rapid boil-off of the
fluid  the abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing  permanent damage to the magnet is rare  but components can be damaged by localized heating  high voltages  or large mechanical forces 
in practice  magnets usually have safety devices to stop or limit the current when the beginning of a quench is detected  if a large magnet undergoes a quench  the inert vapor formed by the evaporating cryogenic fluid can present a significant
hazard to operators by displacing breathable air 
a large section of the superconducting magnets in  s
unexpectedly quenched during start-up operations in 2008  necessitating the replacement of a number of magnets  in order to mitigate against potentially destructive quenches  the superconducting magnets that form the lhc are equipped with fast-ramping heaters which are activated once a quench event is detected by the complex quench protection system  as the dipole bending magnets are connected in series  each power circuit includes 154 individual magnets  and should a quench event occur  the entire combined stored energy of these magnets must be dumped at once  this energy is transferred into dumps that are massive blocks of metal which heat up to several hundreds of degrees celsiusbecause of resistive heatingin a matter of seconds  although undesirable  a magnet quench is a  fairly routine event  during the operation of a particle accelerator 
effluents  
the natural product of the fusion reaction is a small amount of   which is completely harmless to life  of more concern is   which  like other isotopes of hydrogen  is difficult to retain completely  during normal operation  some amount of tritium will be continually released 
although tritium is volatile and biologically active  the health risk posed by a release is much lower than that of most radioactive contaminants  because of tritium s short half-life  12.32 years  and very low decay energy   14.95 kev   and because it does not
 instead being cycled out of the body as water  with a
of 7 to 14 days   current iter designs are investigating total containment facilities for any tritium 
waste management  
the large flux of high-energy neutrons in a reactor will make the structural materials radioactive  the radioactive inventory at shut-down may be comparable to that of a fission reactor  but there are important differences 
the half-life of the
produced by fusion tends to be less than those from fission  so that the inventory decreases more rapidly  unlike fission reactors  whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years  most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself  which would be dangerous for about 50 years  and low-level waste for another 100  although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste  the very short half-life makes the process very attractive  as the waste management is fairly straightforward  by 500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as  
additionally  the choice of materials used in a fusion reactor is less constrained than in a fission design  where many materials are required for their specific   this allows a fusion reactor to be designed using materials that are selected specifically to be  low activation   materials that do not easily become radioactive    for example  would become much less radioactive than  
materials are also low-activation  as well as being strong and light  and are a promising area of study for laser-inertial reactors where a magnetic field is not required 
in general terms  fusion reactors would create far less radioactive material than a fission reactor  the material it would create is less damaging biologically  and the radioactivity  burns off  within a time period that is well within existing engineering capabilities for safe long-term waste storage 
nuclear proliferation  
main article 
although fusion power uses nuclear technology  the overlap with nuclear weapons would be limited  a huge amount of
could be produced by a fusion power station  tritium is used in the trigger of
and in a modern   but it can also be produced by nuclear fission  the energetic neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed weapons-grade
or
for an atomic bomb  for example by transmutation of u238 to pu239  or th232 to u233  
a study conducted 2011 assessed the risk of three scenarios 
use in small-scale fusion station  as a result of much higher power consumption  heat dissipation and a more recognizable design compared to enrichment
this choice would be much easier to detect and therefore implausible 
modifications to produce weapon-usable material in a commercial facility  the production potential is significant  but no fertile or fissile substances necessary for the production of weapon-usable materials needs to be present at a civil fusion system at all  if not shielded  a detection of these materials can be done by their characteristic gamma radiation  the underlying redesign could be detected by regular design information verifications  in the  technically more feasible  case of solid breeder blanket modules  it would be necessary for incoming components to be inspected for the presence of fertile material  otherwise plutonium for several weapons could be produced each year 
prioritizing a fast production of weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy  the fastest way to produce weapon usable material was seen in modifying a prior civil fusion power station  unlike in some nuclear power stations  there is no weapon compatible material during civil use  even without the need for covert action this modification would still take about 2 months to start the production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount for weapon production  this was seen as enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means  to stop the production  a military destruction of inevitable parts of the facility leaving out the reactor itself would be sufficient  this  together with the intrinsic safety of fusion power would only bear a low risk of radioactive contamination 
another study concludes that      large fusion reactors  even if not designed for fissile material breeding  could easily produce several hundred kg pu per year with high weapon quality and very low source material requirements   it was emphasized that the implementation of features for intrinsic proliferation resistance might only be possible at this phase of research and development  the theoretical and computational tools needed for hydrogen bomb design are closely related to those needed for   but have very little in common with the more scientifically developed  
energy source  
large-scale reactors using neutronic fuels  e g    and thermal power production  turbine based  are most comparable to
from an engineering and economics viewpoint  both fission and fusion power stations involve a relatively compact heat source powering a conventional steam turbine-based power station  while producing enough neutron radiation to make
of the station materials problematic  the main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste  though activated station materials still need to be disposed of   there are some power station ideas that may significantly lower the cost or size of such stations  however  research in these areas is nowhere near as advanced as in    
fusion power commonly proposes the use of   an
of hydrogen  as fuel and in many current designs also use   assuming a fusion energy output equal to the 1995 global power output of about 100 j yr    1  1020 j yr  and that this does not increase in the future  which is unlikely  then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years  lithium from sea water would last 60 million years  however  and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years  to put this in context  150 billion years is close to 30 times the remaining lifespan of the sun  and more than 10 times the estimated age of the universe 
economics  
while fusion power is still in early stages of development  substantial sums have been and continue to be invested in research  in the eu almost 10 billion was spent on fusion research up to the end of the 1990s  and the new
reactor alone is budgeted at 6.6 billion total for the timeframe between 2008 and 2020 
it is estimated that up to the point of possible implementation of electricity generation by nuclear fusion  r d will need further promotion totalling around 6080 billion over a period of 50 years or so  of which 2030 billion within the eu  based on a report from 2002  nuclear fusion research receives 750 million  excluding iter funding  from the european union  compared with 810 million for sustainable energy research  putting research into fusion power well ahead of that of any single rivaling technology  indeed  the size of the investments and time frame of the expected results mean that fusion research is almost exclusively publicly funded  while research in other forms of energy can be done by the private sector  in spite of that  a number of start-up companies active in the field of fusion power have managed to attract private money 
advantages  
fusion power would provide more energy for a given weight of fuel than any fuel-consuming energy source currently in use  and the fuel itself  primarily   exists abundantly in the earth s ocean  about 1 in 6500 hydrogen atoms in seawater is deuterium  although this may seem a low proportion  about 0.015    because nuclear fusion reactions are so much more energetic than chemical combustion and seawater is easier to access and more plentiful than fossil fuels  fusion could potentially supply the world s energy needs for millions of years 
despite being technically   fusion power has many of the benefits of renewable energy sources  such as being a long-term energy supply and emitting no   as well as some of the benefits of the resource-limited energy sources as hydrocarbons and nuclear fission  without    like these currently dominant energy sources  fusion could provide very high power-generation density and uninterrupted power delivery  because it is not dependent on the   unlike wind and solar power    
another aspect of fusion energy is that the cost of production does not suffer from   the cost of water and wind energy  for example  goes up as the optimal locations are developed first  while further generators must be sited in less ideal conditions  with fusion energy the production cost will not increase much even if large numbers of stations are built  because the raw resource  seawater  is abundant and widespread   
some problems that are expected to be an issue in this century  such as   can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply  for example  in
stations 
can be purified through
or   nonetheless  these processes are energy intensive  even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources  fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide   
a scenario has been presented of the effect of the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization  iter and later demo are envisioned to bring online the first commercial nuclear fusion energy reactor by 2050  using this as the starting point and the history of the uptake of nuclear fission reactors as a guide  the scenario depicts a rapid take up of nuclear fusion energy starting after the middle of this century   
fusion power could be used in   where solar energy is not available 
criticism  
because commercial fusion projects are very large and complex  and ongoing funding is a political issue  such projects usually involve cost overruns and missed deadlines  for example  the construction of the
cost  5 billion and took seven years longer than expected   s expected cost has gone from  5 billion to  20 billion  and the date for full power operation has been put back to 2027  from the original estimate of 2016
