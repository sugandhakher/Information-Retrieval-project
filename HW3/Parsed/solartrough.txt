parabolic trough at a plant near harper lake  california
a parabolic trough is a type of
that is straight in one dimension and curved as a
in the other two  lined with a polished metal   the energy of
which enters the mirror parallel to its plane of symmetry is focused along the   where objects are positioned that are intended to be heated  for example  food may be placed at the focal line of a trough  which causes the food to be cooked when the trough is aimed so the sun is in its plane of symmetry  further information on the use of parabolic troughs for cooking can be found in the article about  
for other purposes  there is often a tube  frequently a   which runs the length of the trough at its focal line  the mirror is oriented so that sunlight which it reflects is concentrated on the tube  which contains a
which is heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight  the hot fluid can be used for many purposes  often  it is piped to a   which uses the heat energy to drive machinery or to generate electricity  this solar energy collector is the most common and best known type of parabolic trough  the paragraphs below therefore concentrate on this type

the trough is usually aligned on a north-south axis  and rotated to track the sun as it moves across the sky each day  alternatively  the trough can be aligned on an east-west axis  this reduces the overall efficiency of the collector due to cosine loss but only requires the trough to be aligned with the change in   avoiding the need for tracking motors  this tracking method approaches theoretical efficiencies at the spring and fall
with less accurate focusing of the light at other times during the year  the daily motion of the sun across the sky also introduces errors  greatest at the sunrise and sunset and smallest at solar noon  due to these sources of error  seasonally adjusted parabolic troughs are generally designed with a lower  
parabolic trough concentrators have a simple geometry  but their concentration is about 1/3 of the theoretical maximum for the same   that is  for the same overall tolerances of the system to all kinds of errors  including those referenced above  the theoretical maximum is better achieved with more elaborate concentrators based on primary-secondary designs using
which may nearly double the concentration of conventional parabolic troughs and are used to improve practical designs such as those with fixed receivers

the concentrated sunlight  this increases the temperature of the fluid to some 400c  the heat transfer fluid is then used to heat steam in a standard turbine generator  the process is economical and  for heating the pipe  thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80   the overall efficiency from collector to grid  i e   electrical output power   total impinging solar power  is about 15   similar to pv  photovoltaic cells  but less than
 
design  
a parabolic trough is shaped as a parabola in the x-y plane  but is linear in the z direction
a parabolic trough is made of a number of solar collector modules  scm  fixed together to move as one solar collector assembly  sca   a scm could have a length up to 15 metres  49ft  or more  about a dozen or more of scm make each sca up to 200 metres  660ft  length  each sca is an independently tracking parabolic trough 
a scm may be made as a single-piece parabolic mirror or assembled with a number of smaller mirrors in parallel rows  smaller modular mirrors requires smaller machines to build the mirror  reducing cost  cost is also reduced in case of the need of replacing a damaged mirror  like after an object hit  during bad weather or other causes  
in addition  v-type parabolic troughs exist which are made from 2 mirrors and placed at an angle towards each other 
in 2009  scientists at the
 nrel  and
teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30  less expensive than today s best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a
polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors  but at a much lower cost and much lower weight  it also is much easier to deploy and install  the glossy film uses several layers of polymers  with an inner layer of pure silver 
as this renewable source of energy is inconsistent by nature  methods for energy storage have been studied  for instance the single-tank    storage technology for large-scale solar thermal power plants  the thermocline tank approach uses a mixture of silica sand and quartzite rock to displace a significant portion of the volume in the tank  then it is filled with the heat transfer fluid  typically a

enclosed trough  
inside an enclosed trough system
the enclosed trough architecture encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse  the glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system 
lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended within the glasshouse structure  a
positions the mirrors to track the sun and focus its light onto a network of stationary steel pipes  also suspended from the glasshouse structure  steam is generated directly using  oil field-quality water  as water flows from the inlet throughout the length of the pipes  without heat exchangers or intermediate working fluids 
the steam produced is then fed directly to the fields existing steam distribution network  where the steam is continuously injected deep into the oil reservoir  sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up as a result from exposure to humidity    the company that created the enclosed trough design  states its technology can produce heat for eor for about  5 per million british thermal units in sunny regions  compared to between  10 and  12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies 
early commercial adaption  
a 1917 patent drawing for shuman s parabolic trough solar energy system
shuman sunengine 1907 photo  technical world magazine  september 1907
in 1897    a u s  inventor  engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether  which has a lower boiling point than water  and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine  in 1908 shuman formed the sun power company with the intent of building larger solar power plants  he  along with his technical advisor a s e  ackermann and british physicist sir   developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes  increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether  shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water  enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 
shuman built the worlds first
in  
between 1912 and 1913  shumans plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45-52 kilowatt  60-70  engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres of water per minute from the
to adjacent cotton fields  although the outbreak of world war i and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy  shumans vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy  in 1916 shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy s utilization  saying 
we have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun

commercial plants  
array of parabolic troughs 
main article 
most commercial plants utilizing parabolic troughs are hybrids 
are used during night hours  but the amount of fossil fuel used is limited to a maximum 27  of electricity production  allowing the plant to qualify in the us as a renewable energy source    because they are hybrids and include cooling stations   
and other things besides the actual solar collectors  the power generated per square meter of area varies enormously   
as of 2014  the
using parabolic trough technology include  the 354mw
plants in california  the 280mw
that features a   the 250mw   that came online in 2014  as well as the spanish 200mw solaben solar power station  the 200mw   and the   using a eurotrough-collector
