definition  
colors of a single chemical    in different solvents  under visible and uv light  showing how the chemical interacts dynamically with its solvent environment 
a chemical substance  also called a pure substance  may well be defined as  any material with a definite chemical composition  in an introductory general chemistry textbook  according to this definition a chemical substance can either be a pure
or a pure chemical compound  but  there are exceptions to this definition  a pure substance can also be defined as a form of
that has both definite composition and distinct properties  the chemical substance index published by
also includes several
of uncertain composition 
are a special case  in inorganic chemistry  that violates the law of constant composition  and for them  it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound  as in the case of   broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found  for example   the term  chemical substance  means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity  including   i  any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature 
in   substances of uniform composition are called   while physical mixtures  aggregates  of several minerals  different substances  are defined as   many minerals  however  mutually dissolve into   such that a single rock is a uniform substance despite being a mixture in stoichiometric terms 
are a common example 
is an alkali aluminium silicate  where the alkali metal is interchangeably either sodium or potassium 
in law   chemical substances  may include both pure substances and mixtures with a defined composition or manufacturing process  for example  the
regulation
defines  monoconstituent substances    multiconstituent substances  and  substances of unknown or variable composition   the latter two consist of multiple chemical substances  however  their identity can be established either by direct chemical analysis or reference to a single manufacturing process  for example 
is an extremely complex  partially polymeric mixture that can be defined by its manufacturing process  therefore  although the exact chemical identity is unknown  identification can be made to a sufficient accuracy  the cas index also includes mixtures 
almost always appear as mixtures of molecules of multiple molar masses  each of which could be considered a separate chemical substance  however  the polymer may be defined by a known precursor or reaction s  and the   for example 
is a mixture of very long chains of -ch2- repeating units  and is generally sold in several molar mass distributions     
and  
history  
the
of a  chemical substance  became firmly established in the late eighteenth century after work by the chemist
on the composition of some pure chemical compounds such as   he deduced that   all samples of a compound have the same composition  that is  all samples have the same proportions  by mass  of the elements present in the compound   this is now known as the   later with the advancement of methods for
particularly in the realm of   the discovery of many more chemical elements and new techniques in the realm of
used for isolation and purification of elements and compounds from chemicals that led to the establishment of modern   the concept was defined as is found in most chemistry textbooks  however  there are some controversies regarding this definition mainly because the large number of chemical substances reported in chemistry literature need to be indexed 
caused much consternation to early researchers  since
have exactly the same composition  but differ in configuration  arrangement  of the atoms  for example  there was much speculation for the chemical identity of   until the correct structure was described by   likewise  the idea of
- that atoms have rigid three-dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three-dimensional arrangement - was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct chemical substances  for example

is a chemical substance that is made up of a particular kind of atoms and hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction into a different element  though it can be transmutated into another element through a   this is so  because all of the atoms in a sample of an element have the same number of protons  though they may be different   with differing numbers of neutrons 
as of 2012  there are 118 known elements  about 80 of which are stable  that is  they do not change by
into other elements  some elements can occur as more than a single chemical substance     for instance  oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen  o2  and
 o3   the majority of elements are classified as   these are elements with a characteristic

a pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of
or   two or more elements combined into one substance through a
form a   all compounds are substances  but not all substances are compounds 
a chemical compound can be either atoms
together in
or
in which atoms  molecules or ions form a   compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called   and all others are called   compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal are called  
compounds in which components share electrons are known as
compounds  compounds consisting of oppositely charged
are known as
compounds  or  
in organic chemistry  there can be more than one chemical compound with the same composition and molecular weight  generally  these are called   isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties  may be isolated and do not spontaneously convert to each other  a common example is
vs    the former is an   the latter is a   their interconversion requires either
or   however  there are also   where isomerization occurs spontaneously  such that a pure substance cannot be isolated into its tautomers  a common example is   which has open-chain and ring forms  one cannot manufacture pure open-chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes to the
form  materials may also comprise other entities such as polymers  these may be inorganic or organic and sometimes a combination of inorganic and organic

all matter consists of various elements and chemical compounds  but these are often intimately mixed together  mixtures contain more than one chemical substance  and they do not have a fixed composition  in principle  they can be separated into the component substances by purely
processes   
and
are common examples of mixtures 
grey iron metal and yellow
are both chemical elements  and they can be mixed together in any ratio to form a yellow-grey mixture  no chemical process occurs  and the material can be identified as a mixture by the fact that the sulfur and the iron can be separated by a mechanical process  such as using a
to attract the iron away from the sulfur 
in contrast  if iron and sulfur are heated together in a certain ratio  1 atom of iron for each atom of sulfur  or by weight  56
 1   of iron to 32grams  1mol  of sulfur   a chemical reaction takes place and a new substance is formed  the compound   with chemical formula fes  the resulting compound has all the properties of a chemical substance and is not a mixture  iron ii  sulfide has its own distinct properties such as
and   and the two elements cannot be separated using normal mechanical processes  a magnet will be unable to recover the iron  since there is no metallic iron present in the compound 
chemicals versus chemical substances  
while the term chemical substance is a precise technical term that is synonymous with  chemical  for professional chemists  the meaning of the word chemical varies for non-chemists within the english speaking world or those using english  for industries  government and society in general in some countries  the word chemical includes a wider class of substances that contain many mixtures of such chemical substances  often finding application in many vocations  in countries that require a list of ingredients in products  the  chemicals  listed would be equated with  chemical substances  
within the chemical industry  manufactured  chemicals  are chemical substances  which can be classified by production volume into bulk chemicals 
and chemicals found in research only 
bulk chemicals are produced in very large quantities  usually with highly optimized continuous processes and to a relatively low price 
fine chemicals are produced at a high cost in small quantities for special low-volume applications such as biocides  pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals for technical applications 
research chemicals are produced individually for research  such as when searching for synthetic routes or screening substances for pharmaceutical activity  in effect  their price per gram is very high  although they are not sold 
the cause of the difference in production volume is the complexity of the molecular structure of the chemical  bulk chemicals are usually much less complex  while fine chemicals may be more complex  many of them are simple enough to be sold as  building blocks  in the synthesis of more complex molecules targeted for single use  as named above  the production of a chemical includes not only its synthesis but also its purification to eliminate by-products and impurities involved in the synthesis  the last step in production should be the analysis of batch lots of chemicals in order to identify and quantify the percentages of impurities for the buyer of the chemicals  the required purity and analysis depends on the application  but higher tolerance of impurities is usually expected in the production of bulk chemicals  thus  the user of the chemical in the us might choose between the bulk or  technical grade  with higher amounts of impurities or a much purer  pharmaceutical grade   labeled  usp     
naming and indexing  
every chemical substance has one or more   usually named according to the   an alternative system is used by the
 cas  
many compounds are also known by their more common  simpler names  many of which predate the systematic name  for example  the long-known
is now systematically named 6- hydroxymethyl oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol 
and
are also given simpler names  for example the mild pain-killer
is the more common name for the chemical compound  s -6-methoxy--methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid 
frequently refer to

by professional chemists around the world  an enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements  as of may 2011  about sixty million chemical compounds are known  the names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately  also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature  several international organizations like
and cas have initiated steps to make such tasks easier  cas provides the abstracting services of the chemical literature  and provides a numerical identifier  known as
