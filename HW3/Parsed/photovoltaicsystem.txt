into usable   it comprises the solar array and the balance of system components  pv systems can be categorized by various aspects  such as 
vs 
systems  building-integrated vs  rack-mounted systems  residential vs  utility systems 
vs  centralized systems  rooftop vs  ground-mounted systems  tracking vs  fixed-tilt systems  and new constructed vs 
systems  other distinctions may include  systems with microinverters vs  central inverter  systems using
vs    and systems with modules from chinese vs  european and u s -manufacturers 
about 99 percent of all european and 90 percent of all u s  solar power systems are connected to the   while off-grid systems are somewhat more common in australia and south korea  14 pv systems rarely use battery storage  this may change soon  as government incentives for distributed energy storage are being implemented and investments in storage solutions are gradually becoming economically viable for small systems  a solar array of a typical residential pv system is rack-mounted on the roof  rather than integrated into the roof or facade of the building  as this is significantly more expensive  utility-scale
are ground-mounted  with fixed tilted solar panels rather than using expensive tracking devices  crystalline silicon is the predominant material used in 90 percent of worldwide produced solar modules  while rival thin-film has lost market-share in recent years  1720 about 70 percent of all solar cells and modules are produced in china and taiwan  leaving only 5 percent to european and us-  1112 the installed capacity for both  small rooftop systems and large solar power stations is growing rapidly and in equal parts  although there is a notable trend towards utility-scale systems  as the focus on new installations is shifting away from europe to sunnier regions  such as the
in the u s   which are less opposed to ground-mounted solar farms and cost-effectiveness is more emphasized by investors  43
driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication  the cost of photovoltaics is declining continuously  there are several million pv systems distributed all over the world  mostly in europe  with 1.4 million systems in germany alone 5as well as north america with 440,000 systems in the united states  the energy
of a conventional solar module increased from 15 to 20 percent over the last 10 years 17 and a pv system recoups the energy needed for its manufacture in about 2 years  in exceptionally irradiated locations  or when thin-film technology is used  the so-called
decreases to one year or less  3033
and financial incentives  such as preferential
for solar-generated electricity  have also greatly supported installations of pv systems in many countries  the
from large-scale pv systems has become competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions  and
has been achieved in about 30 different countries 
as of 2015  the
is rapidly approaching the 200gw mark  about 40 times the installed capacity of 2006  photovoltaic systems currently contribute about 1 percent to worldwide electricity generation 
in terms of capacity are currently china  japan and the united states  while half of the world s capacity is installed in europe  with germany and italy supplying 7  to 8  of their respective domestic electricity consumption with solar pv  the international energy agency expects
to become the world s largest source of electricity by 2050  with solar photovoltaics and
contributing 16  and 11  to the global demand  respectively

schematics of a typical residential pv system
a grid connected system is connected to a larger independent grid  typically the public electricity grid  and feeds energy directly into the grid  this energy may be shared by a residential or commercial building before or after the revenue measurement point  the difference being whether the credited energy production is calculated independently of the customer s energy consumption    or only on the difference of energy     grid connected systems vary in size from residential  210kwp  to solar power stations  up to 10s of mwp   this is a form of   the feeding of electricity into the grid requires the transformation of dc into ac by a special  synchronising   in kilowatt-sized installations the dc side system voltage is as high as permitted  typically 1000v except us residential 600v  to limit ohmic losses  most modules  60 or 72 crystalline silicon cells  generate 160w to 300w at 36 volts  it is sometimes necessary or desirable to connect the modules partially in parallel rather than all in series  one set of modules connected in series is known as a  string  
scale of system  
photovoltaic systems are generally categorized into three distinct market segments  residential rooftop  commercial rooftop  and ground-mount utility-scale systems  their capacities range from a few kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts  a typical residential system is around 10 kilowatts and mounted on a sloped roof  while commercial systems may reach a megawatt-scale and are generally installed on low-slope or even flat roofs  although rooftop mounted systems are small and display a higher
than large utility-scale installations  they account for the largest share in the market  there is  however  a growing trend towards bigger utility-scale power plants  especially in the  sunbelt  region of the planet  43

a photovoltaic system for residential  commercial  or industrial energy supply consists of the solar array and a number of components often summarized as the
 bos   the term originates from the fact that some bos-components are balancing the power-generating subsystem of the solar array with the power-using side  the load  bos-components include power-conditioning equipment and structures for mounting  typically one or more dc to

shading and dirt
photovoltaic cell electrical output is extremely sensitive to shading  the effects of this shading are well known  when even a small portion of a cell  module  or array is shaded  while the remainder is in sunlight  the output falls dramatically due to internal  short-circuiting   the electrons reversing course through the shaded portion of the    if the current drawn from the series string of cells is no greater than the current that can be produced by the shaded cell  the current  and so power  developed by the string is limited  if enough voltage is available from the rest of the cells in a string  current will be forced through the cell by breaking down the junction in the shaded portion  this breakdown voltage in common cells is between 10 and 30 volts  instead of adding to the power produced by the panel  the shaded cell absorbs power  turning it into heat  since the reverse voltage of a shaded cell is much greater than the forward voltage of an illuminated cell  one shaded cell can absorb the power of many other cells in the string  disproportionately affecting panel output  for example  a shaded cell may drop 8 volts  instead of adding 0.5 volts  at a particular current level  thereby absorbing the power produced by 16 other cells  it is  thus important that a pv installation is not shaded by trees or other obstructions 
several methods have been developed to determine shading losses from trees to pv systems over both large regions using   but also at an individual system level using   most modules have bypass diodes between each cell or string of cells that minimize the effects of shading and only lose the power of the shaded portion of the array  the main job of the bypass diode is to eliminate hot spots that form on cells that can cause further damage to the array  and cause fires  sunlight can be absorbed by dust  snow  or other impurities at the surface of the module  this can reduce the light that strikes the cells  in general these losses aggregated over the year are small even for locations in canada  maintaining a clean module surface will increase output performance over the life of the module  google found that cleaning the flat mounted solar panels after 15 months increased their output by almost 100   but that the 5  tilted arrays were adequately cleaned by rainwater 
insolation and energy
global
is made up of direct  diffuse  and reflected   the absorption factor of a pv cell is dened as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell  at high noon on a cloudless day at the equator  the power of the sun is about 1  m  on the earth s surface  to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun s rays  as such  pv arrays can
through each day to greatly enhance energy collection  however  tracking devices add cost  and require maintenance  so it is more common for pv arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face
 approximately due south in the northern hemisphere or due north in the southern hemisphere   the tilt angle  from horizontal  can be varied for season  but if fixed  should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system  this optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output  the optimization of the a photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux  soiling  and snow losses should be taken into effect  in addition  recent work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection  for example  the spectral
can play a significant role in output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system
and the type of solar cell material  for the weather and latitudes of the united states and europe  typical insolation ranges from 4 kwh m day in northern climes to 6.5 kwh m day in the sunniest regions  a photovoltaic installation in the southern latitudes of europe or the united states may expect to produce 1 kwh m day  a typical 1kw photovoltaic installation in australia or the southern latitudes of europe or united states  may produce 3.55kwh per day  dependent on location  orientation  tilt  insolation and other factors  in the
desert  with less cloud cover and a better solar angle  one could ideally obtain closer to 8.3 kwh m day provided the nearly ever present wind would not blow sand onto the units  the area of the sahara desert is over 9 million km  90,600km  or about 1   could generate as much electricity as all of the world s power plants combined

a
tilts a solar panel throughout the day  depending on the type of tracking system  the panel is either aimed directly at the sun or the brightest area of a partly clouded sky  trackers greatly enhance early morning and late afternoon performance  increasing the total amount of power produced by a system by about 2025  for a single axis tracker and about 30  or more for a dual axis tracker  depending on latitude  trackers are effective in regions that receive a large portion of sunlight directly  in diffuse light  i e  under cloud or fog   tracking has little or no value  because most
systems are very sensitive to the sunlight s angle  tracking systems allow them to produce useful power for more than a brief period each day  tracking systems improve performance for two main reasons  first  when a solar panel is perpendicular to the sunlight  it receives more light on its surface than if it were angled  second  direct light is used more efficiently than angled light    special
can improve solar panel efficiency for direct and angled light  somewhat reducing the benefit of tracking 
trackers and sensors to optimise the performance are often seen as optional  but tracking systems can increase viable output by up to 45   pv arrays that approach or exceed one megawatt often use solar trackers  accounting for clouds  and the fact that most of the world is not on the equator  and that the sun sets in the evening  the correct measure of solar power is
 the average number of kilowatt-hours per square meter per day  for the weather and latitudes of the united states and europe  typical insolation ranges from 2.26kwh m day in northern climes to 5.61kwh m day in the sunniest regions 
for large systems  the energy gained by using tracking systems can outweigh the added complexity  trackers can increase efficiency by 30  or more   for   the added maintenance of tracking is a substantial detriment  tracking is not required for flat panel and low-concentration   for high-concentration photovoltaic systems  dual axis tracking is a necessity  pricing trends affect the balance between adding more stationary solar panels versus having fewer panels that track  when solar panel prices drop  trackers become a less attractive option

common battery technologies used in today s pv systems include the  a modified version of the conventional

batteries  compared to the other types  lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density  however  due to their high reliability  low self discharge as well as low investment and maintenance costs  they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale  residential pv systems  as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries  furthermore  as storage devices for pv systems are stationary  the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries are not as critical as  for example  in  4,9 other rechargeable batteries that are considered for distributed pv systems include

the metering must be able to accumulate energy units in both directions or two meters must be used  many meters accumulate bidirectionally  some systems use two meters  but a unidirectional meter  with detent  will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid  in some countries  for installations over 30
a frequency and a voltage monitor with disconnection of all phases is required  this is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility  and the excess can not either be exported or   grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity  now they need to also provide storage  this is normally hydro-storage  but other means of storage are used  initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output  with   storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available  and consumption whenever it is needed 
a canadian electricity meter
the two variables a grid operator have are storing electricity for when it is needed  or transmitting it to where it is needed  if both of those fail  installations over 30kwp can automatically shut down  although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate  grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems  although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power  and results in a substantial loss of revenue  three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements 
photovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize their operation  there are several photovoltaic monitoring strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature  monitoring can be performed on site or remotely  it can measure production only  retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment  probes  meters  etc    monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions  individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software  energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes  a third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters  using the inverter manufacturer s protocols  and also acquire weather-related information  independent

in 2015  a case-study conducted in seven countries concluded that in all cases generating costs can be reduced by hybridising mini-grids and isolated grids  however  financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant  while cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant  the study also identified economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities  such as  
there has also been recent work showing that the pv penetration limit can be increased by deploying a distributed network of pv chp hybrid systems in the u s  the temporal distribution of solar flux  electrical and heating requirements for representative u s  single family residences were analyzed and the results clearly show that hybridizing chp with pv can enable additional pv deployment above what is possible with a conventional centralized electric generation system  this theory was reconfirmed with numerical simulations using per second solar flux data to determine that the necessary battery backup to provide for such a hybrid system is possible with relatively small and inexpensive battery systems  in addition  large pv chp systems are possible for institutional buildings  which again provide back up for intermittent pv and reduce chp runtime 
 hybrid pv t   also known as photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy  such a system combines a solar  pv  module with a
in an complementary way 
  a concentrated photovoltaic thermal hybrid  cpvt  system is similar to a pvt system  it uses
 cpv  instead of conventional pv technology  and combines it with a solar thermal collector 
cpv csp system  a novel solar cpv csp hybrid system has been proposed recently  combining concentrator photovoltaics with the non-pv technology of
 csp   or also known as concentrated solar thermal 
  it combines a photovoltaic system with a   combinations with
are possible and include  
floating solar arrays  
floating solar arrays are pv systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs  quarry lakes  irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds  a small number of such systems exist in france  india  japan  south korea  the united kingdom  singapore and the united states 
the systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land  the cost of land is more expensive  and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation  unlike most land-based solar plants  floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view  they achieve higher efficiencies than pv panels on land  because water cools the panels  the panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion 
in may 2008  the far niente winery in oakville  california  pioneered the world s first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar pv modules with a total capacity of 477kw onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery s irrigation pond  the primary benefit of such a system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose  in the case of the far niente winery  it saved three-quarters of an acre that would have been required for a land-based system  another benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land  leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion  the floating pv array also reduces the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibits the growth of algae 
utility-scale floating pv farms are starting to be built  the multinational electronics and ceramics manufacturer
will develop the world s largest  a 13.4mw farm on the reservoir above yamakura dam in
using 50,000 solar panels  salt-water resistant floating farms are also being considered for ocean use  with experiments in thailand  the largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350mw power station in the amazon region of brazil 
direct current grid  
dc grids are found in electric powered transport  railways trams and trolleybuses  a few pilot plants for such applications have been built  such as the tram depots in hannover leinhausen  using photovoltaic contributors and geneva  bachet de pesay   the 150kwp geneva site feeds 600v dc directly into the tram trolleybus electricity network whereas before it provided about 15  of the electricity at its opening in 1999

a
or off-grid system is not connected to the   standalone systems vary widely in size and application from
or
to remote buildings or   if the load is to be supplied independently of solar   the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery  in non-portable applications where weight is not an issue  such as in buildings 
are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse 
a charge controller may be incorporated in the system to avoid battery damage by excessive charging or discharging  it may also help to optimize production from the solar array using a maximum power point tracking technique     however  in simple pv systems where the pv module voltage is matched to the battery voltage  the use of mppt electronics is generally considered unnecessary  since the battery voltage is stable enough to provide near-maximum power collection from the pv module  in small devices  e g  calculators  parking meters  only
 dc  is consumed  in larger systems  e g  buildings  remote water pumps  ac is usually required  to convert the dc from the modules or batteries into ac  an

in
settings  the array may be used to directly power dc   without the need for an   in remote settings such as mountainous areas  islands  or other places where a power grid is unavailable  solar arrays can be used as the sole source of electricity  usually by charging a   stand-alone systems closely relate to
and  
pico pv systems
the smallest  often portable photovoltaic systems are called pico solar pv systems  or pico solar  they mostly combine a rechargeable battery and charge controller  with a very small pv panel  the panel s nominal capacity is just a few watt-peak  110 wp  and its area less than a tenth of a square meter  or one square foot  in size  a large range of different applications can be solar powered such as music players  fans  portable lamps  security lights  solar lighting kits  solar lanterns and street light  see below   phone chargers  radios  or even small  seven-inch lcd televisions  that run on less than ten watts  as it is the case for power generation from   pico pv systems are useful in small  rural communities that require only a small amount of electricity  since the efficiency of many appliances have improved considerably  in particular due to the usage of
and efficient rechargeable batteries  pico solar has become an affordable alternative  especially in the developing world  the metric prefix
stands for a trillionth to indicate the smallness of the system s electric power 
solar street lights
raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure  the solar array of such off-grid pv system charges a   which powers a fluorescent or led lamp during the night  solar street lights are stand-alone power systems  and have the advantage of savings on trenching  landscaping  and maintenance costs  as well as on the electric bills  despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting  they are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation  they are expected to dim only slightly 
telecommunication and signaling
solar pv power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange  radio and tv broadcasting  microwave and other forms of electronic communication links  this is because  in most telecommunication application  storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically dc  in hilly and mountainous terrain  radio and tv signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain  at these locations 
are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population 
solar vehicles
  whether ground  water  air or space vehicles may obtain some or all of the energy required for their operation from the sun  surface vehicles generally require higher power levels than can be sustained by a practically sized solar array  so a battery assists in meeting peak power demand  and the solar array recharges it  space vehicles have successfully used solar photovoltaic systems for years of operation  eliminating the weight of fuel or primary batteries 
solar pumps
one of the most cost effective solar applications is a solar powered pump  as it is far cheaper to purchase a solar panel than it is to run power lines  they often meet a need for water beyond the reach of power lines  taking the place of a
or   one common application is the filling of livestock watering tanks  so that grazing cattle may drink  another is the refilling of drinking water storage tanks on remote or self-sufficient homes 
spacecraft
have been one of the first applications of photovoltaics since the launch of
in 1958  the first satellite to use solar cells  contrary to   the first artificial satellite to orbit the planet  that ran out of batteries within 21 days due to the lack of solar-power  most modern
and
in the
rely on the use of solar panels to derive electricity from sunlight 
do it yourself community
with a growing interest in environmentally friendly green energy  an increasing number of hobbyists in the -community have endeavored to build their own solar pv systems from kits or partly   usually  the diy-community uses inexpensive or high efficiency systems  such as those with   to generate their own power  as a result  the diy-systems often end up cheaper than their commercial counterparts  often  the system is also hooked up into the regular   using
instead of a battery for backup  these systems usually generate power amount of  2kw or less  through the internet  the community is now able to obtain plans to  partly  construct the system and there is a growing trend toward building them for domestic requirements

costs and economy  
median installed system prices for residential pv systems in japan  germany and the united states    w 
history of solar rooftop prices since 2006  comparison in us  per installed watt 
the cost of producing photovotaic cells have dropped due to economies of scale in production and technological advances in manufacturing  for large-scale installations  prices below  1.00 per watt were common by 2012  a price decrease of 50  had been achieved in europe from 2006 to 2011 and there is a potential to lower the generation cost by 50  by 2020  crystal silicon
have largely been replaced by less expensive multicrystalline silicon solar cells  and thin film silicon solar cells have also been developed recently at lower costs of production  although they are reduced in energy conversion efficiency from single crystalline  siwafers   they are also much easier to produce at comparably lower costs 
the table below shows the total cost in us cents per kwh of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system  the row headings on the left show the total cost  per peak kilowatt  kwp   of a photovoltaic installation  photovoltaic system costs have been declining and in germany  for example  were reported to have fallen to usd 1389 kwp by the end of 2014  the column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kwh expected from each installed kwp  this varies by geographic region because the average
depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight  it also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon  panels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude  and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing solar  
can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight  thereby raising the total energy output 
the calculated values in the table reflect the total cost in cents per kwh produced  they assume a 10  total capital cost  for instance 4    1  operating and maintenance cost  and

regulation  
standardization  
increasing use of photovoltaic systems and integration of photovoltaic power into existing structures and techniques of supply and distribution increases the value of general standards and definitions for photovoltaic components and systems    the standards are compiled at the
 iec  and apply to efficiency  durability and safety of cells  modules  simulation programs  plug connectors and cables  mounting systems  overall efficiency of inverters etc 
planning and permit  
while article 690 of the national electric code provides general guidelines for the installation of photovoltaic systems  these guidelines may be superseded by local laws and regulations  often a permit is required necessitating plan submissions and structural calculations before work may begin  additionally  many locales require the work to be performed under the guidance of a licensed electrician  check with the local city county ahj  authority having jurisdiction  to ensure compliance with any applicable laws or regulations 
in the   the
 ahj  will review designs and issue permits  before construction can lawfully begin  electrical installation practices must comply with standards set forth within the
 nec  and be inspected by the ahj to ensure compliance with     and
code  jurisdictions may require that equipment has been tested  certified  listed  and labeled by at least one of the
 nrtl   despite the complicated installation process  a recent list of solar contractors shows a majority of installation companies were founded since 2000 
national regulations  
united kingdom
in the uk  pv installations are generally considered permitted development and don t require planning permission  if the property is listed or in a designated area  national park  area of outstanding natural beauty  site of special scientific interest or norfolk broads  then planning permission is required 
united states
in the us  many localities require a permit to install a photovoltaic system  a grid-tied system normally requires a licensed electrician to make the connection between the system and the grid-connected wiring of the building  installers who meet these qualifications are located in almost every state  the state of california prohibits
from restricting solar devices 
spain
although
of its electricity via photovoltaic and other renewable energy sources  and cities such as huelva and seville boast nearly 3,000 hours of sunshine per year  spain has issued a solar tax to account for the debt created by the investment done by the spanish government  those who do not connect to the grid can face up to a fine of 30 million euros   40 million usd
