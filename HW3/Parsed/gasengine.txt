model of an s type hartop gas engine
a gas engine is an
which runs on a gas fuel  such as      
or   in the   the term is unambiguous  in the   due to the widespread use of  gas  as an abbreviation for   such an engine might also be called a gaseous-fueled engine or natural gas engine or spark ignited 
generally the term gas engine refers to a heavy-duty industrial engine capable of running continuously at full load for periods approaching a high fraction of 8,760 hours per year  unlike a gasoline automobile engine  which is lightweight  high-revving and typically runs for no more than 4,000 hours in its entire life  typical power ranges from 10kw  13hp  to 4,000kw  5,364hp

history  
lenoir gas engine 1860 
otto- gas engine 1867 
3bhp gas fired crossley atmospheric engine in action at anson engine museum 
lenoir  
there were many experiments with gas engines in the 19th century but the first practical gas-fuelled
was built by the belgian engineer
in 1860  however  the lenoir engine suffered from a low power output and high fuel consumption 
otto and langen  
his work was further researched and improved by a german engineer   who was later to invent the first 4-stroke engine to efficiently burn fuel directly in a piston chamber  in august 1864 otto met
who  being technically trained  glimpsed the potential of otto s development  and one month after the meeting  founded the first engine factory in the world  na otto   cie  in cologne  in 1867 otto patented his improved design and it was awarded the grand prize at the 1867 paris world exhibition  this atmospheric engine worked by drawing a mixture of gas and air into a vertical cylinder  when the piston has risen about eight inches  the gas and air mixture is ignited by a small pilot flame burning outside  which forces the piston  which is connected to a toothed rack  upwards  creating a partial vacuum beneath it  no work is done on the upward stroke  the work is done when the piston and toothed rack descend under the effects of atmospheric pressure and their own weight  turning the main shaft and flywheels as they fall  its advantage over the existing steam engine was its ability to be started and stopped on demand  making it ideal for intermittent work such as barge loading or unloading 
four-stroke engine  
the atmospheric gas engine was in turn replaced by otto s   the changeover to four-stroke engines was remarkably rapid  with the last atmospheric engines being made in 1877  liquid-fuelled engines soon followed using diesel  around 1898  or gasoline  petrol   around 1900  
crossley  
the best-known builder of gas engines in the
was
of manchester  who in 1869 acquired the uk and world  except german  rights to the patents of otto and langden for the new gas-fuelled atmospheric engine  in 1876 they acquired the rights to the more efficient otto four-stroke cycle engine 
tangye  
there were several other firms based in the
area as well    of smethwick  near birmingham  sold its first gas engine  a 1
two-cycle type  in 1881  and in 1890 the firm commenced manufacture of the four-cycle gas engine 
preservation  
the
in   near     has a collection of engines that includes several working gas engines  including the largest running
atmospheric engine ever made 
current manufacturers  
manufacturers of gas engines include   rolls-royce with the                           mtu  man    doosan  and   output ranges from about 10kw  13hp 
to 18mw  24,000hp   generally speaking  the modern high-speed gas engine is very competitive with gas turbines up to about 50mw  67,000hp  depending on circumstances  and the best ones are much more fuel efficient than the gas turbines  rolls-royce with the bergen engines  caterpillar and many other manufacturers base their products on a diesel engine block and crankshaft  ge jenbacher and waukesha are the only two companies whose engines are designed and dedicated to gas alone 
typical applications  
stationary  
typical applications are
or high-hour generation schemes  including

 where the waste heat from the engine may be used to warm the digesters   for typical biogas engine installation parameters see  for parameters of a large gas engine chp system  as fitted in a factory  see  gas engines are rarely used for standby applications  which remain largely the province of diesel engines  one exception to this is the small   150kw  emergency generator often installed by farms  museums  small businesses  and residences  connected to either natural gas from the public utility or propane from on-site storage tanks  these generators can be arranged for automatic starting upon power failure 
transport  
the natural gas engines  lng  are getting more into the marine market  as the lean-burn gas engine can meet the new emission requirements without any extra fuel treatment or exhaust cleaning systems  use of engines running on
 cng  is also growing in the
sector  users in the united kingdom include   use of gas buses is supported by the gas bus alliance and manufacturers include  
use of methane or propane gases  
since
   has long been a clean  economical  and readily available fuel  many industrial engines are either designed or modified to use gas  as distinguished from   although the carbon emission footprint does not differ significantly  their operation produces less complex-hydrocarbon pollution  and the engines have fewer internal problems  one example is the
   engine used in vast numbers of   common us usage of  gas  to mean  gasoline  requires the explicit identification of a natural gas engine   there is also such a thing as  natural gasoline     but this term is very rarely observed outside the refining industry  
technical details  
a gas engine differs from a
in the way the fuel and air are mixed  a petrol engine uses a
or
but a gas engine often uses a
system to introduce gas into the air flow  early gas engines used a three-valve system  with separate inlet valves for air and gas 
the weak point of a gas engine compared to a
is the exhaust valves  since the gas engine exhaust gases are much hotter for a given output  and this limits the power output  thus a diesel engine from a given manufacturer will usually have a higher maximum output than the same engine block size in the gas engine version  the diesel engine will generally have three different ratings - standby  prime  and continuous   uk  1-hour rating  12-hour rating and continuous rating  whereas the gas engine will generally only have a continuous rating  which will be less than the diesel continuous rating
energy balance  
thermal efficiency  
gas engines that run on natural gas typically have a thermal efficiency between 35-45   lcv basis    the best engines can achieve a thermal efficiency of slightly more than 48   lcv basis   these gas engines are usually medium speed engines
fuel energy arises at the output shaft  the remainder appears as waste heat  large engines are more efficient than small engines  gas engines running on
typically have a slightly lower efficiency   1-2   and
reduces the efficiency further still  ge jenbacher s recent j624 engine is the world s first 24-cylinder gas engine with high efficiency running on methane 
when considering engine efficiency one should consider whether this is based on the lower heating value  lcv  or higher heating value  hcv  of the gas  engine manufacturers will typically quote efficiencies based on the lower heating value of the gas  i e  the efficiency after energy has been taken to evaporate the intrinsic moisture within the gas itself  gas distribution networks will typically charge based upon the higher heating value of the gas  i e  total energy content   a quoted engine efficiency based on lcv might be say 44  whereas the same engine might have an hcv of 39.6  based on hcv on natural gas  it is also important to ensure that efficiency comparisons are on a like for like basis  for example some manufactures have mechanically driven pumps whereas other use electrically driven pumps to drive engine cooling water  and the electrical usage can sometimes be ignored giving a falsely high apparent efficiency compared to the direct drive engines 
combined heat and power  
main article 
engine reject heat can be used for building heating or heating a process  in an engine  roughly half the waste heat arises  from the engine jacket  oil cooler and after-cooler circuits  as hot water which can be at up to 110c  the remainder arises as high-temperature heat which can generate pressurised hot water or steam by the use of an exhaust gas  
engine cooling  
two most common engine types are an
or
engine  water cooled nowadays use
in the
some engines  air or water  have an added
cooling is required to remove excessive heat  over heating can cause engine failure  usually from wear  cracking or warping
