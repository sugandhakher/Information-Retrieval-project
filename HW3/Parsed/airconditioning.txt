evaporative cooling  
since prehistoric times  snow and ice were used for cooling  the business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late 17th century  this practice was replaced by mechanical ice-making machines 
the basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient egypt  where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water  the evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window  this process also made the air more humid  which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate  in   water from

and   a chemistry professor at   conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object  franklin and hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids  such as alcohol and ether  could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water  they conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed-up the evaporation  they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to 14c  7f  while the ambient temperature was 18c  64f   franklin noted that  soon after they passed the freezing point of water 0c  32f   a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer s bulb and that the ice mass was about 6mm  14in  thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching 14c  7f   franklin concluded   from this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer s day

discovered that compressing and liquefying
could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate  in 1842 
physician
used compressor technology to create ice  which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in     he hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings  he even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities  though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly  gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine  improved process for the artificial production of ice  his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died  gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine  according to his biographer  vivian m  sherlock  he blamed the  ice king     for his failure  suspecting that tudor had launched a
against his invention  dr  gorrie died impoverished in 1855  and the idea of air conditioning went away for 50 years 
 s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the barwon river at rocky point in geelong  australia   his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853  and his patent for an ether
compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855  this novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser  where it cooled down and liquefied  the liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again  cooling down the surrounding system  the machine employed a flywheel and produced 3,000 kilograms of ice per day

electromechanical cooling  
in 1902  the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was
by

designed to improve manufacturing process control in a
plant  carrier s invention controlled not only
but also   carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process  instead of sending air through hot coils  he sent it through cold coils  filled with cold water   the air was cooled  and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled  which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable  the controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment  later  carrier s technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace  and
was formed to meet rising demand  over time  air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and
as well  residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s

operating principles  
refrigeration cycle

capillary expansion valve connection to evaporator inlet  notice
formation
in the refrigeration cycle  heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area  as heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction  work is required to achieve this  a
is an example of such a system  as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment  the
is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently rejects that heat elsewhere 
circulating refrigerant vapor enters the   where its pressure and temperature are   the hot  compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be
and is routed through a   here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid  thus  the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air  the removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils  making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve 
the condensed  pressurized  and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an
 often nothing more than a pinhole in the system s copper tubing  where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure  that pressure reduction results in
of a part of the liquid refrigerant  greatly lowering its temperature  the cold refrigerant is then routed through the   a fan blows the interior warm air  which is to be cooled  across the evaporator  causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well  further lowering the temperature  the warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan  blower into the room 
to complete the refrigeration cycle  the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor  in order for the process to have any efficiency  the cooling  evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating  condensing portion  and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own  kind  of air  either the hot air or the cool air   modern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside  they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside  because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it  the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside  usually through a drain hole 
as this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it  it never causes mineral buildup on the coils  though if the unit is set at its strongest cooling setting and happens to have inadequate circulation of air through the coils and also experiences a failure of the thermistor which senses the ambient temperature in the room  the coil s fins can develop a layer of ice which will then grow and eventually block the circulation of air on the cool side of the unit altogether in a positive feedback loop that will cause the formation of an ice block inside the unit  only minuscule amounts of cool air will then manage to come from the exhaust vent until this ice is removed or is allowed to melt  this will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low  once ice begins to form on the evaporative fins  it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice  etc  a clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this  as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit s thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally  a failing thermistor may also cause this problem  this is the same issue faced by refrigerators that do not have a
cycle  dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result  ice 
by running an air conditioner s compressor in the opposite direction  the overall effect can be completely reversed and the indoor compartment will become heated instead of cooled  see   the engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gasvapor mixtures is called  
heat pump unit  
main article 
an example of an externally fitted ac unit which uses a heat pump system 
a heat pump is an air conditioner in which the
can be reversed  producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment  they are also commonly referred to as a  reverse cycle air conditioner   the heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than   some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a   when the heat pump is in heating mode  the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil  producing heat  the outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator  and discharges cold air  colder than the ambient outdoor air  
air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4055f  413c   because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold  this is because ice forms on the outdoor unit s heat exchanger coil  which blocks air flow over the coil  to compensate for this  the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil  so that it can heat up and defrost  a heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling  which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter  the icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures  so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating  such as a
or
  which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures  in this case  the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures  and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower 
are a kind of air-source heat pump  but they do not depend on electricity to power them  instead  gas  solar power  or heated water is used as a main power source  an absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water  which gives off heat  next  the water and ammonia mixture is depressurized to induce boiling  and the ammonia is boiled off  which absorbs heat from the outdoor air   
some more expensive window air conditioning units have a true heat pump function  however  a window unit may only have an electric resistance heater 
evaporative cooling  
main article 
an evaporative cooler
in very dry climates  evaporative coolers  sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers  are popular for improving coolness during hot weather  an evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad  such as a large
soaked with water  the
of the incoming air  as measured by a   is reduced  the temperature of the incoming air is reduced  but it is also more humid  so the
 sensible heat plus latent heat  is unchanged  some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads  if the entering air is dry enough  the results can be quite substantial 
evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity  when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants  unlike other types of air conditioners  evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system  this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window  these coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain 
free cooling  
main article 
air conditioning can also be provided by a process called
which uses pumps to circulate a coolant  typically water or a glycol mix  from a cold source  which in turn acts as a
for the energy that is removed from the cooled space  common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes  equipped with heat exchanger  some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems  using free cooling early in the cooling season  and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage  the heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season  thereby declining its effectiveness 
free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies  and are sometimes combined with
 stes  so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning  free cooling and hybrid systems are  
humidity control  
since humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the
of
from the skin  drier air  up to a point  improves the comfort provided  the comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 50  to 60  relative humidity in the occupied space 
dehumidification and cooling  
refrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the absolute
of the air processed by the system  the relatively cold  below the   evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air  much like an ice-cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass  therefore  water vapor is removed from the cooled air and the relative humidity in the room is lowered  the water is usually sent to a drain or may simply drip onto the ground outdoors  the heat is rejected by the condenser which is located outside of room to be cooled 
dehumidification only  
main article 
typical portable dehumidifier
a specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a   it also uses a   but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path  a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside  however  since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room  no heat energy is removed  instead  the electric
consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat  so the room is actually heated  just as by an
that draws the same amount of power 
in addition  if water is condensed in the room  the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room  the    the dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an   and instead releases heat  therefore  an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly  as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water 
inside the unit  the air passes over the evaporator coil first  and is cooled and dehumidified  the now dehumidified  cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again  then the air is released back into the room  the unit produces warm  dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment  room  that is to be conditioned 
dehumidifiers are commonly used in cold  damp climates to prevent
growth indoors  especially in basements  they are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in  
energy transfer  
in a thermodynamically   any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature  which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners  requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase  this increase has the effect that  for each unit of energy input into the system  say to power a light bulb in the closed system   the air conditioner removes that energy  in order to do so  the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its  efficiency     times the amount of power dissipated into the system  as an example  assume that inside the closed system a 100w
is activated  and the air conditioner has an coefficient of performance of 200   the air conditioner s power consumption will increase by 50w to compensate for this  thus making the 100w heating element cost a total of 150w of power 
it is typical for air conditioners to operate at  efficiencies  of significantly greater than 100   however  it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality  lower   than the output thermal energy  heat energy  
air conditioner equipment power in the u s  is often described in terms of  tons of refrigeration   a
is approximately equal to the cooling power of one
 2000 pounds or 907 kilograms  of ice melting in a 24-hour period  the value is defined as 12,000
per hour  or 3517 watts  residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons  3 to 20 kilowatts  kw   in capacity 
seasonal energy efficiency ratio  
main article 
for residential homes  some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency  in the united states  the efficiency of air conditioners is often  but not always  rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio  seer   the higher the seer rating  the more energy efficient is the air conditioner  the seer rating is the btu of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in
 wh  during the same period 
seer   btu   wh 
this can also be rewritten as 
seer    btu   h   w  where  w  is the average electrical power in watts  and  btu h  is the rated cooling power 
for example  a 5000 btu h air-conditioning unit  with a seer of 10  would consume 5000/10   500 watts of power on average 
the electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time 
500 w  1000 h   500,000 wh   500
assuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season  i e   8 hours per day for 125 days per year  
another method that yields the same result  is to calculate the total annual cooling output 
5000 btu h  1000 h   5,000,000 btu
then  for a seer of 10  the annual electrical energy usage would be 
5,000,000 btu  10   500,000 wh   500 kwh
seer is related to the
 cop  commonly used in
and also to the
 eer   the eer is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures  while seer is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures  i e   the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the seer test   seer is unusual in that it is composed of an
divided by an   the cop is a ratio with the same metric units of energy    in both the
and   they cancel out  leaving a   formulas for the approximate conversion between seer and eer or cop are available from the  
 1    seer   eer  0.9
 2    seer   cop  3.792
 3    eer   cop  3.413
from equation  2  above  a seer of 13 is equivalent to a cop of 3.43  which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy 
the united states now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum seer rating of 13  although window-box systems are exempt from this law  so their seer is still around 10  
installation types  
window unit and packaged terminal  
how a window air conditioner works
air conditioning window unit
parts of a window unit
window unit air conditioners are installed in an open window  the interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator  on the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser  a large house or building may have several such units  allowing each room to be cooled separately 
systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems    they are ductless systems  ptacs  which are frequently used in hotels  have two separate units  terminal packages   the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior  with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them  this minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently  ptac systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather  either directly by using an electric strip  gas  or other heater  or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air  converting the air conditioner into a heat pump  while room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility  when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning 
the first practical through-the-wall air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at
and offered for sale starting in 1935 
split systems  
split-system air conditioners come in two forms  mini-split and central systems  in both types  the inside-environment  evaporative 
is separated by some distance from the outside-environment  condensing unit  heat exchanger 
mini-split  ductless  system  
outside part of a ductless split-type air conditioner
indoor part of a ductless split-type air conditioner
a mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building  mutli-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms  zones  to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit  multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted  ceiling-mounted  ceiling recessed  and horizontal ducted  mini-split systems typically produce 9,000to 36,000btu  9,50038,000kj  per hour of cooling  multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 btu s 
advantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms  the inside wall space required is significantly reduced  also  the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space  rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a ptac or window air conditioner  flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one s   these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof  in addition  ductless systems offer higher efficiency  reaching above 30 seer 
the primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost  such systems cost about us 1,500 to us 2,000 per ton  12,000 btu per hour  of cooling capacity  this is about 30  more than central systems  not including ductwork  and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity  
an additional possible disadvantage that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems  although lower operating costs and
or other financial incentivesoffered in some areascan help offset the initial expense 
central  ducted  air conditioning  
central    air conditioning offers whole-house or large-commercial-space cooling  and often offers moderate multi-zone temperature control capability by the addition of air-louver-control boxes 
in central air conditioning  the inside heat-exchanger is typically placed inside the central furnace ac unit of the
which is then used in the summer to distribute chilled air throughout a residence or commercial building 
portable units  
a portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office  they are currently available with capacities of about 5,00060,000btu h  1,50018,000w  and with or without electric-resistance heaters  portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative 
the compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled  meaning they use air to exchange heat  in the same way as a car or typical household air conditioner does  such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it  it collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area  doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air 
portable split system  
a portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes  similar to a permanently fixed installed unit 
portable hose system  
hose systems  which can be monoblock or air-to-air  are vented to the outside via air   the monoblock type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full  the air-to-air type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously 
a single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser  and then vents it outside  this air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms  due to the negative pressure inside the room   thus reducing the unit s effectiveness 
modern units might have a
of approximately 3  i e   1kw of electricity will produce 3kw of cooling   a dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room  and thus is more effective than most single-hose units 
portable evaporative system  
  sometimes called  swamp coolers   do not have a compressor or condenser  liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins  releasing the vapor into the cooled area  evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat  the   cooling the air  humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by  
evaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area  making them truly portable  they are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners 
uses  
air-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into comfort and process applications 
comfort applications  
an array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building 
comfort applications aim to provide a
that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads 
air conditioning makes
buildings feasible  for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with
so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via   air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller  since
increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildings    comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as 
commercial buildings  which are built for commerce  including offices  malls  shopping centers  restaurants  etc 
high-rise residential buildings  such as tall dormitories and apartment blocks
industrial spaces where thermal comfort of workers is desired
institutional buildings  which includes government buildings  hospitals  schools  etc 
low-rise residential buildings  including single-family houses  duplexes  and small apartment buildings
sports stadiums  such as the
and in  
women have  on average  a significantly lower resting
than men  using inaccurate metabolic rate guidelines for air conditioning sizing can result in oversized and less efficient equipment  and setting system operating setpoints too cold can result in reduced worker productivity 
in addition to buildings  air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation  including automobiles  buses and other land vehicles  trains  ships  aircraft  and spacecraft 
domestic usage  
typical residential central air conditioner in north america
air conditioning is common in the us  with 88  of new
constructed in 2011 including air conditioning  ranging from 99  in the
to 62  in the   in   air conditioning use varies by province  in 2013  55  of canadian households reported having an air conditioner  with high use in
 80   
 78   
 67    and
 54   and lower use in
 23   
 21    and
 9    in europe  home air conditioning is generally less common 
countries such as
have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years  in another southern european country    it is estimated that around 55  of households have an air conditioner installed  in india ac sales have dropped by 40     due to higher costs and stricter energy efficiency regulations 
process applications  
process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out  regardless of internal heat and humidity loads and external weather conditions  it is the needs of the process that determine conditions  not human preference  process applications include these 
and
for the production of     and the like  in which very high levels of air cleanliness and control of temperature and humidity are required for the success of the process 
of
facilities for breeding   since many animals normally reproduce only in   holding them in rooms in which conditions mirror those of spring all year can cause them to reproduce year-round 
food
and
areas
hospital   in which air is filtered to high levels to reduce
risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration  although temperatures are often in the comfort range  some specialist procedures  such as   require low temperatures  about 18c  64f  and others  such as   relatively high temperatures  about 28c  82f  
facilities
physical testing facilities
plants and farm growing areas
in both comfort and process applications  the objective may be to not only control temperature  but also   air quality  and air movement from space to space 
health effects  
air-conditioning systems can promote the growth and spread of microorganisms  such as   the infectious agent responsible for   or thermophilic   however  this is only prevalent in poorly maintained water   as long as the cooling tower is kept clean  usually by means of a chlorine treatment   these health hazards can be avoided or reduced 
conversely  air conditioning  including filtration  humidification  cooling and disinfection  can be used to provide a clean  safe 
atmosphere in hospital operating rooms and other environments where proper atmosphere is critical to patient safety and well-being  excessive air conditioning can have a negative effect on skin  causing it to dry out  and can also cause  
environmental impacts  
power consumption  
innovation in air conditioning technologies continues  with much recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency  production of the electricity used to operate air conditioners has an environmental impact  including the release of greenhouse gases 
cylinder unloaders are a method of load control used mainly in commercial air conditioning systems  on a semi-  or open  compressor  the heads can be fitted with unloaders which remove a portion of the load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed  unloaders can be electrical or mechanical 
in an automobile  the a c system will use around 4
 3kw  of the engine s   thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle 
refrigerants  
most refrigerants used for air conditioning contribute to global warming  and many also   cfcs  hcfcs  and hfcs are potent
when leaked to the atmosphere 
the use of
as a refrigerant was once common  being used in the refrigerants r-11 and r-12  sold under the brand name freon-12   freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties  however  these chlorine-bearing refrigerants reach the
when they escape  once the refrigerant reaches the  
from the
the chlorine-   yielding a chlorine   these chlorine radicals
the breakdown of
into
  depleting the
that shields the earth s surface from strong uv radiation  each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical  forming a stable
and breaking the  
prior to 1994  most automotive air conditioning systems used r-12 as a refrigerant  it was replaced with
refrigerant  which has no   old r-12 systems can be retrofitted to r-134a by a complete flush and filter dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil  which is not compatible with r-134a 
 also known as hcfc-22  has a
about 1,800 times higher than   it was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010  and is to be completely discontinued by 2020  although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of  uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere 
in the uk  the ozone regulations came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting hcfc refrigerants such as r22 in new systems  the regulation banned the use of r22 as a  top-up  fluid for maintenance between 2010  for virgin fluid  and 2015  for recycled fluid   this means that equipment that uses r22 can still operate  as long as it does not leak  although r22 is now banned  units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained 
the manufacture and use of cfcs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion  see also    in light of these environmental concerns  beginning on november 14  1994  the
environmental protection agency has restricted the sale  possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians  per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the clean air act 
as an alternative to conventional refrigerants  other gases  such as co2     have been proposed  r-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in europe and japan  it is an effective refrigerant with a
of 1  but it must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effect   
in 1992  a non-governmental organization  greenpeace  was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a european lab find substitute refrigerants  this led to two alternatives  one a blend of propane  r290  and isobutane  r600a   and one of pure isobutane  industry resisted change in europe until 1993  and in the u s  until 2011  despite some supportive steps in 2004 and 2008  see refrigerant development above
