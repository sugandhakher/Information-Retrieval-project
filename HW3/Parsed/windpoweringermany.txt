overview  
wind power germany 2015 fact sheet  electricity generation  development  investments  capacity  employment and the public opinion 
as of 2010  wind power in germany provides over 96,100 people with jobs and german wind energy systems are also exported  the   built in 2006 near the village of laasow  brandenburg  was the tallest wind turbine in the world for six years 
in germany  hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens  wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of germany s electricity  wind power has gained very high social acceptance in germany 
in 2016  germany decided to replace feed-in tariffs with auctions from 2017 
repowering  
  the replacement of first-generation wind turbines with modern multi-megawatt machines  is occurring in germany  modern turbines make better use of available wind energy and so more wind power can come from the same area of land  modern turbines also offer much better grid integration since they use a connection method similar to conventional power plants 
offshore wind power  
offshore wind farms in the german bight
see also          and
offshore wind energy also has great potential in germany  wind speed at sea is 70 to 100  higher than onshore and much more constant  a new generation of 5mw or larger wind turbines which are capable of making full use of the potential of wind power at sea has already been developed and prototypes are available  this makes it possible to operate offshore wind farms in a cost-effective way once the usual initial difficulties of new technologies have been overcome 
on 15 july 2009  the first offshore german windturbine completed construction  this turbine is the first of a total of 12 wind turbines for the
offshore wind farm in the north sea 
following the   germany s federal government is working on a new plan for increasing   with a particular focus on   under the plan  large
will be erected far away from the coastlines  where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land  and where the enormous turbines won t bother the inhabitants  the plan aims to decrease germany s dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants  the german government wants to see 7.6gw installed by 2020 and as much as 26gw by 2030 
a major challenge will be the lack of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany 
in 2014  all in all 410 turbines with 1747 megawatts were added to germany s offshore windparks  due to not yet finished grid-connections  only turbines with combined 528.9 megawatts were added to the grid feed at the end of 2014  despite this  the gigawatt offshore windpower barrier has been breached by germany at the end of 2014 
energy transition  
main article 
the 2010  energiewende  policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables  particularly wind power  germany s share of renewables has increased from around 5  in 1999 to 17  in 2010  reaching close to the oecd average of 18  usage of renewables  producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years  guaranteeing a fixed income  energy co-operatives have been created  and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits  the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market  nuclear power plants were closed  and the existing 9 plants will close earlier than necessary  in 2022 
the reduction of reliance on nuclear plants has so far had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels and on electricity imports from france  however  in good wind germany exports to france  in january 2015 the average price was 29 mwh in germany  and 39 mwh in france  one factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure  sdlink  to bring the power to market  the transmission constraint sometimes causes germany to pay
to stop producing  in october november 2015 this amounted to 96 gwh costing 1.8 million euros 
different
have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines  industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers  who have had rising electricity bills  germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe
