overconsumption is a situation where
has outpaced the
of the   a prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to
and the eventual
bases  generally the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of   that is the more people  the more
of
to sustain their lives  currently  the inhabitants of the
of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world  who make up the majority of the human population  7.4 billion people  
the theory was coined to augment the discussion of   which reflects issues of
without taking into account per capita consumption  by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support 
and the
often argue that consumption per person  or   is typically lower in poor than in rich nations

effects

a fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet s   excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment    and subsequent resource depletion 
and reduced  
the scale of modern life s overconsumption has enabled an
to exist  displaying
and     however once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption 
in the long term these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources
and in the worst case a  
of the   has said   it would take 1.5 earths to sustain our present level of consumption  environmentally  the world is in an overshoot mode  
economic growth  
the
said china and india  with their booming economies  along with the united states  are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global   the
2006 report said the two countries  high
exposed the reality of severe pollution  the report states that
the world s ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of china  india  japan  europe and the united states as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way 
footprint  
main article 
the idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint  the term ecological footprint refers to the resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere  currently  china is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint  yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the usa  it is estimated that if china developed to the level of the united states that world consumption rates would roughly double 
counteractions  
the most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming   less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead  countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries  such as
and
technologies  to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden  a fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place  movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include                    and thrifting 
other researchers and movements such as
suggest a new socioeconomic model which  through a structural increase of   collaboration and locality in production as well as effective   increased   sustainability and optimal design of products  is expected to reduce resource-consumption
