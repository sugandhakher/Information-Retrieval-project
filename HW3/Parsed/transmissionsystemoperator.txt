simplified diagram of ac electricity distribution from generation stations to consumers
a transmission system operator  tso  is an entity entrusted with transporting energy in the form of
or electrical power on a national or regional level  using fixed   the term is defined by the european commission  the certification procedure for transmission system operators is listed in article 10 of the electricity and gas directives of 2009 
due to the cost of establishing a transmission infrastructure  such as
or gas main lines and associated connection points  a tso is usually a   and as such is often subjected to regulations 
in electrical power business  a tso is an operator that
from generation plants over the
to regional or local
operators 
in natural gas business  a tso receives gas from producers  transports it via pipeline through an area and delivers to gas distribution companies

role in electrical power transmission  
safety and reliability are a critical issue for transmission system operators  since any failure on their grid or their electrical generation sources might propagate to a very large number of customers  causing personal and property damages  natural hazards and generation consumption imbalances are a major cause of concern  to minimize the probability of grid instability and failure  regional or national transmission system operators are interconnected to each other 
electricity market operations  
the role of the system operator in a wholesale
is to manage the security of the
in real time and co-ordinate the supply of and demand for electricity  in a manner that avoids fluctuations in frequency or interruptions of supply  the system operator service is normally specified in rules or codes established as part of the electricity market 
the system operator function may be owned by the
company  or may be fully independent  they are often wholly or partly owned by state or national governments  in many cases they are independent of
companies  upstream  and
companies  downstream   they are financed either by the states or countries or by charging a toll proportional to the energy they carry 
the system operator is required to maintain a continuous  second-by-second  balance between electricity supply from power stations and demand from consumers  and also ensure the provision of reserves that will allow for sudden contingencies  the system operator achieves this by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each market trading period  instructing generators when and how much electricity to generate  and managing any contingent events that cause the balance between supply and demand to be disrupted  system operations staff undertake this work using sophisticated energy modelling and communications systems 
in addition to its roles of real-time dispatch of generation and managing security  the system operator also carries out investigations and planning to ensure that supply can meet demand and system security can be maintained during future trading periods  examples of planning work may include co- ordinating generator and transmission outages  facilitating commissioning of new generating plant and procuring ancillary services to support power system operation 
role in gas transmission  
a gas tso works for the functioning of the internal market and cross-border trade for gas and to ensure the optimal management  coordinated operation and sound technical evolution of the natural gas transmission network  some gas tsos also provide the marketplace for gas trading  either directly or through
