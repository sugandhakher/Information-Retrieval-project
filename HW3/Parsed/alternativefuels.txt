alternative fuels  known as non-conventional or advanced   are any materials or
that can be used as   other than conventional fuels like 
   oil     and    as well as nuclear materials such as
and   as well as artificial
fuels that are made in nuclear reactors 
some well-known alternative
include  
        chemically stored
 batteries and      non-fossil   non-fossil    
and other

background  
the main purpose of fuel is to store energy  which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of use 
almost all fuels are chemical fuels  the user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work  such as powering an engine  it may also be used to generate electricity  which is then used for heating  lighting  or other purpose 
biofuel

at the right 
biofuels are also considered a renewable source  although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity  it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels 
biomass  
main article 
biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead
which can be used as fuel or for industrial production 
algae-based fuels  
main article 
algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems  algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production  algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the u s  navy algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices 
biodiesel  
is made from animal fats or vegetable oils  renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha  soybean  sunflowers  corn  olive  peanut  palm  coconut  safflower  canola  sesame  cottonseed  etc  once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol  biodiesel is brought to life   from this chemical reaction  these raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions  or used alone  despite ones mixture preference  biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants  carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons  than conventional diesel  because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently  even with regular diesels reduced quantity of sulfur from the ulsd  ultra-low sulfur diesel  invention  biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free 
alcohol fuels  
main articles        and
methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy  they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy  these alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels  butanol has another advantage  it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks  instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars   
ammonia  
 nh3  can be used as fuel  benefits of ammonia include no need for oil  zero emissions  low cost  and distributed production reducing transport and related pollution

carbon related
carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for   minimizing problems of wind and solar   and enabling transmission of wind  water  and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines  such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the
or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels  enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles  germany has built a 250-kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts 
has constructed a carbon neutral
 lng  plant in   the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their
automobiles  and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity  other commercial developments are taking place in     and  
the least expensive source of carbon for recycling into fuel is   where it can be extracted for about us  7.50 per ton  automobile exhaust gas capture has also been proposed to be economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting  since carbonic acid in seawater is in
with atmospheric carbon dioxide  extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied  researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about  50 per ton 
is more costly  at between  600 and  1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration 
nighttime
is considered   the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the
for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  therefore  the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative  off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the u s  averaged 1.64 cents per
in 2009  but only 0.71 cents kwh during the least expensive six hours of the day  typically 
electricity costs 2 to 5 cents kwh during the day  commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than
fuels when oil costs more than  55 per barrel  the u s  navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about  6 per gallon  while that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010  it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue  moreover  since the delivery of fuel to a
costs about  8 per gallon  shipboard production is already much less expensive  however  u s  civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power  the navy s estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than  1 per gallon 
hydrogen   formic acid  
main article 
hydrogen is an emissionless fuel  the byproduct of hydrogen burning is water  although some mono-nitrogen oxides
are produced when hydrogen is burned with air 
main article 
another fuel is formic acid  the fuel is used by converting it first to hydrogen  and using that in a   formic acid is much more easy to store than hydrogen 
hydrogen compressed natural gas mixture  
main article 
 or h2cng  is a mixture of
and 4-9 percent
by energy 
liquid nitrogen  
is another type of emissionless and efficient fuel 
compressed air  
the
is an emission-free piston engine using
as fuel  unlike hydrogen  compressed air is about one-tenth as expensive as fossil fuel  making it an economically attractive alternative fuel 
propane autogas  
main article 
is a cleaner burning  high performance fuel derived from multiple sources  it is known by many names including propane  lpg  liquified propane gas   lpa  liquid propane autogas   autogas and others  propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family 
propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall  propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply  liquid storage at low pressure  an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels 
propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 112 depending on the composition of the butane propane ratios of the mixture  propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an  intercooler  effect  reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density  the resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion 
propane lacks additives  detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe  the cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions  lower nox due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder  higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil 
propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products  it is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of propane to the market 
propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly 5bar  73psi  of pressure  fueling vehicles is similar to gasoline in speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment  propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and does not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to
which is usually kept at over 3,000psi  210bar  
in a vehicle format  propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large  pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles 
natural gas vehicles  
 cng  and
 lng  are two cleaner combusting alternatives to conventional liquid
fuels 
compressed natural gas fuel types  
compressed natural gas  cng  vehicles can use both renewable cng and non-renewable cng 
conventional cng is produced from the many underground natural gas reserves are in widespread production worldwide today  new technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources  appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way 
renewable natural gas or biogas is a methanebased gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel  present sources of biogas are mainly landfills  sewage  and animal agriwaste  based on the process type  biogas can be divided into the following  biogas produced by anaerobic digestion  landfill gas collected from landfills  treated to remove trace contaminants  and synthetic natural gas  sng  
practicality  
around the world  this gas powers more than 5 million vehicles  and just over 150,000 of these are in the u s  american usage is growing at a dramatic rate 
environmental analysis  
because natural gas emits little pollutant when combusted  cleaner air quality has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles tailpipe co2 can be reduced by 1525  compared to gasoline  diesel  the greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty  light duty and refuse truck segments 
co2 reductions of up to 88  are possible by using biogas 
similarities to hydrogen natural gas  like hydrogen  is another fuel that burns cleanly  cleaner than both gasoline and diesel engines  also  none of the smog-forming contaminates are emitted  hydrogen and natural gas are both lighter than air and can be mixed together 
nuclear power and radiothermal generators  
main articles 
and
nuclear reactors  
nuclear power is any
designed to extract usable energy from
via controlled   the only controlled method now practical uses
in a
fuel  with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent    use of the nuclear reaction
for controlled power generation is not yet practical  but is an active area of research 
nuclear power is usually used by using a
to heat a working fluid such as water  which is then used to create steam pressure  which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water  today  more than 15  of the world s electricity comes from nuclear power  and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built 
in theory  electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for
in space  but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight  some smaller reactors  such as the   are built to minimize moving parts  and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly  making them useful for space missions  but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes  power from
has been used in a number of spacecraft  all of them unmanned  the soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in
military radar satellites  where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the earth s oceans  the u s  also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965  in the
mission  no nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988 
thorium fuelled nuclear reactors  
reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years  it is being backed by many scientists and researchers  and professor james hansen  the former director at
goddard institute for space studies has reportedly said  after studying
for over four decades  its clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace   safer  cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution 
is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than   and its ore    is commonly found in sands along bodies of water  thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium  while
are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners  thorium is taken from open pits  monazite is present in countries such as australia  the united states and india  in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years  as an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors  thorium has been proven to add to proliferation  produces
for
like
 half-life over 200,000 years   and has a longer fuel cycle 
for a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors  see  
radiothermal generators  
in addition 
have been used as alternative fuels  on both land and in space  their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened  the decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes  particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak  and low temperatures is a problem 
 rtgs  which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction  but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has  in turn  been produced on earth as a concentrated power source  fuel  using energy from an earth-based
