an enhanced geothermal system  egs  generates
without the need for natural
hydrothermal resources  until recently  geothermal power systems have exploited only resources where naturally occurring heat  water  and rock
are sufficient to allow energy extraction  however  by far most of geothermal energy within reach of conventional techniques is in dry and impermeable rock  egs technologies enhance and or create geothermal resources in this hot dry rock  hdr  through  hydraulic stimulation  
when natural cracks and pores do not allow economic flow rates  the
can be enhanced by pumping high-pressure cold water down an
into the rock  the injection increases the fluid pressure in the naturally fractured rock  triggering shear events that enhance the system s permeability  as long as the injection pressure is maintained  a high matrix permeability is not required  nor are
required to maintain the fractures in an open state  this process is termed hydro-shearing  perhaps to differentiate it from   used in the oil and gas industry  which can create new fractures through the rock in addition to expanding the existing fractures 
water travels through fractures in the rock  capturing the rock s heat until forced out of a second borehole as very hot water  the water s heat is converted into
using either a
or a   all of the water  now cooled  is injected back into the ground to heat up again in a  
egs technologies can function as baseload resources that produce power 24 hours a day  unlike hydrothermal  egs may be feasible anywhere in the world  depending on the economic limits of drill depth  good locations are over deep
covered by a 35 kilometres  1.93.1mi  layer of insulating sediments that slow heat loss  an egs plant is expected to have an economical lifetime of 20-30 years using current technology 
egs systems are currently being developed and tested in         the
and   the largest egs project in the world is a 25- demonstration plant currently being developed in   australia  cooper basin has the potential to generate 5,00010,000mw

research and development  
australia  
the australian government has provided research funding for the development of hot dry rock technology 
on 30 may 2007  then australian opposition environmental spokesperson and former
announced that if elected at the   the
would use taxpayer money to subsidise putting the necessary drilling rigs in place  in an interview  he promised 
 there are some technical difficulties and challenges there  but those people who are keen on getting australia into geothermal say we ve got this great access to resource and one of the things  interestingly  that s held them back is not having the capacity to put the drilling plants in place  and so what we intend this  50 million to go towards is to provide one-for-one dollars  match
from us   1 from the industry so that they can get these drilling rigs on to site and really get the best sites identified and get the industry going  
european union  
the eu s egs r d project at   france  has recently connected its 1.5mw demonstration plant to the grid  the soultz project has explored the connection of multiple stimulated zones and the performance of triplet well configurations  1 injector 2 producers  
led to the cancellation of the egs project there 
the portuguese government awarded  in december 2008  an exclusive license to geovita ltd to prospect and explore geothermal energy in one of the best areas in continental portugal  an area of about 500 square kilometers is being studied by geovita together with the earth sciences department of the university of coimbra s science and technology faculty  and the installation of an enhanced geothermal system  egs  is foreseen 
united kingdom  
cornwall is set to host a 3mw demonstration project  based at the eden project  that could pave the way for a series of 50-mw commercial-scale geothermal power stations in suitable areas across the country 
a commercial-scale project near redruth is also planned  the plant  which has been granted planning permission  would generate 10 mw of electricity and 55 mw of thermal energy and is scheduled to become operational in 20132014 
united states  
early days  fenton hill  
main article 
the first egs effort  then termed hot dry rock  took place at fenton hill  new mexico with a project run by the federal los alamos laboratory  it was the first attempt to make a deep  full-scale egs reservoir 
the egs reservoir at fenton hill was first completed in 1977 at a depth of about 2.6km  with rock temperatures of 185 c  in 1979 the reservoir was enlarged with additional hydraulic stimulation and was operated for about 1 year  the results demonstrated that heat could be extracted at reasonable rates from a hydraulically stimulated region of low-permeability hot crystalline rock  in 1986  a second reservoir was prepared for initial hydraulic circulation and heat extraction testing  in a 30-day flow test with a constant reinjection temperature of 20 c  the production temperature steadily increased to about 190 c  corresponding to a thermal power level of about 10 mw  due to budget cuts  further study at fenton hill was discontinued 
working at the edgesusing egs technology to improve hydrothermal resources  
egs funding languished for the next few years  and by the next decade  us efforts focused on the less ambitious goal of improving the productivity of existing hydrothermal resources  according to the fiscal year 2004 budget request to congress from doe s office of energy efficiency and renewable energy 
egs are engineered reservoirs that have been created to extract heat from economically unproductive geothermal resources  egs technology includes those methods and equipment that enhance the removal of energy from a resource by increasing the productivity of the reservoir  better productivity may result from improving the reservoirs natural permeability and or providing additional fluids to transport heat 
in fiscal year 2002  preliminary designs for five projects employing egs technology were completed and the coso hot springs geothermal field at the us naval weapons air station in china lake  california was selected for full-scale development  two additional projects were selected for preliminary analysis at desert peak in nevada and glass mountain in california  funding for this effort totaled  1.5 million  the effort was continued in 2003 with an additional  3.5 million 
in 2009  the us department of energy    issued two
 foas  related to enhanced geothermal systems  together  the two foas offered up to  84 million over six years 
the doe followed up with another foa in 2009  of stimulus funding from the american reinvestment and recovery act for  350 million  including  80 million aimed specifically at egs projects 
forge  
in february 2014  the department of energy announced the intent to establish  a dedicated subsurface laboratory called the frontier observatory for research in geothermal energy  forge   in order to investigate and develop enhanced geothermal technology  in april 2015  it was announced that the proposed sites had been narrowed to five  expected to be reduced to at most three the following year  eventually  the selected site will host the forge laboratory  which will provide annual solicitations for research to be performed there 
induced seismicity  
main article 
some induced seismicity is inevitable and expected in egs  which involves pumping fluids at pressure to enhance or create permeability through the use of hydro-shearing and hydraulic fracturing techniques  hydro-shear stimulation methods seek to expand and extend the connectivity of the rock s existing fractures to create a better fluid network for the transfer of heat from the rock to the fluid  seismicity events at the geysers geothermal field in california have been strongly correlated with injection data 
the case of
merits special mention  it led the city  which is a partner  to suspend the project and conduct a seismic hazard evaluation  which resulted in the cancellation of the project in december 2009 
according to the australian government  risks associated with  hydrofracturing induced seismicity are low compared to that of natural earthquakes  and can be reduced by careful management and monitoring  and  should not be regarded as an impediment to further development of the hot rock geothermal energy resource   however  the risks of induced seismicity vary from site to site and should be considered before large scale fluid injection is begun 
co2 egs  
the geothermal energy centre of excellence at the university of queensland has been awarded
18.3 million for egs research  a large portion of which will be used to develop co2 egs technologies 
research conducted at los alamos national laboratories and lawrence berkeley national laboratories examined the use of   instead of water  as the geothermal working fluid  with favorable results  co2 has numerous advantages for egs 
greater power output
minimized parasitic losses from pumping and cooling
carbon sequestration
minimized water use
co2 has a much lower tendency to dissolve minerals and other substances than water  which greatly reduces scaling and corrosion of system components
co2 is  however  much more expensive and somewhat more difficult to work with than water 
egs potential in the united states  
technologies 
a 2006 report by   and funded by the   conducted the most comprehensive analysis to date on the potential and technical status of egs  the 18-member panel  chaired by professor jefferson tester of mit  reached several significant conclusions 
resource size  the report calculated the united states total egs resources from 310km of depth to be over 13,000  of which over 200zj would be extractable  with the potential to increase this to over 2,000zj with technology improvements  sufficient to provide all the world s current energy needs for several   the report found that total geothermal resources  including hydrothermal and geo-pressured resources  to equal 14,000 zj  or roughly 140,000 times the total u s  annual primary energy use in 2005 
development potential  with an r d investment of  1 billion over 15 years  the report estimated that 100gwe  gigawatts of electricity  or more could be installed by 2050 in the united states  the report further found that  recoverable  resources  accessible with today s technology  were between 1.212.2tw for the conservative and moderate recovery scenarios respectively 
cost  the report found that egs could be capable of producing electricity for as low as 3.9 cents kwh  egs costs were found to be sensitive to four main factors 
temperature of the resource
fluid flow through the system measured in liters second
drilling costs
power conversion efficiency
