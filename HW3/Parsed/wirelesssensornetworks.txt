typical multi-hop wireless sensor network architecture
wireless sensor networks  wsn   sometimes called wireless sensor and actuator networks  wsan   are spatially distributed
to monitor physical or environmental conditions  such as       etc  and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location  the more modern networks are bi-directional  also enabling control of sensor activity  the development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance  today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications  such as industrial process monitoring and control  machine health monitoring  and so on 
the wsn is built of  nodes   from a few to several hundreds or even thousands  where each node is connected to one  or sometimes several  sensors  each such sensor network node has typically several parts  a
with an internal
or connection to an external antenna  a   an electronic circuit for interfacing with the sensors and an energy source  usually a
or an
form of   a
might vary in size from that of a shoebox down to the size of a grain of dust  although functioning  motes  of genuine microscopic dimensions have yet to be created  the cost of sensor nodes is similarly variable  ranging from a few to hundreds of dollars  depending on the complexity of the individual sensor nodes  size and cost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding constraints on resources such as energy  memory  computational speed and communications bandwidth  the topology of the wsns can vary from a simple
to an advanced

application  
area monitoring  
area monitoring is a common application of wsns  in area monitoring  the wsn is deployed over a region where some phenomenon is to be monitored  a military example is the use of sensors detect enemy intrusion  a civilian example is the
of gas or oil pipelines 
health care monitoring  
the medical applications can be of two types  wearable and implanted  wearable devices are used on the body surface of a human or just at close proximity of the user  the implantable medical devices are those that are inserted inside human body  there are many other applications too e g  body position measurement and location of the person  overall monitoring of ill patients in hospitals and at homes  body-area networks can collect information about an individual s health  fitness  and energy expenditure 
environmental earth sensing  
there are many applications in monitoring environmental parameters  examples of which are given below  they share the extra challenges of harsh environments and reduced power supply 
air pollution monitoring  
wireless sensor networks have been deployed in several cities      and   to monitor the concentration of   these can take advantage of the ad hoc wireless links rather than wired installations  which also make them more mobile for testing readings in different areas   
forest fire detection  
a network of sensor nodes can be installed in a forest to detect when a
has started  the nodes can be equipped with sensors to measure temperature  humidity and gases which are produced by fire in the trees or vegetation  the early detection is crucial for a successful action of the firefighters  thanks to wireless sensor networks  the fire brigade will be able to know when a fire is started and how it is spreading 
landslide detection  
a
detection system makes use of a wireless sensor network to detect the slight movements of soil and changes in various parameters that may occur before or during a landslide  through the data gathered it may be possible to know the impending occurrence of landslides long before it actually happens 
water quality monitoring  
monitoring involves analyzing water properties in dams  rivers  lakes   oceans  as well as underground water reserves  the use of many wireless distributed sensors enables the creation of a more accurate map of the water status  and allows the permanent deployment of monitoring stations in locations of difficult access  without the need of manual data retrieval 
natural disaster prevention  
wireless sensor networks can effectively act to prevent the consequences of   like floods  wireless nodes have successfully been deployed in rivers where changes of the water levels have to be monitored in real time 
industrial monitoring  
machine health monitoring  
wireless sensor networks have been developed for machinery condition-based maintenance  cbm  as they offer significant cost savings and enable new functionality 
wireless sensors can be placed in locations difficult or impossible to reach with a wired system  such as rotating machinery and untethered vehicles 
data center monitoring  
due to the high density of servers racks in a data center  often cabling and ip addresses are an issue  to overcome that problem more and more racks are fitted out with wireless temperature sensors to monitor the intake and outtake temperatures of racks  as
recommends up to 6 temperature sensors per rack  meshed wireless temperature technology gives an advantage compared to traditional cabled sensors 
data logging  
main article 
wireless sensor networks are also used for the collection of data for monitoring of environmental information  this can be as simple as the monitoring of the temperature in a fridge to the level of water in overflow tanks in nuclear power plants  the statistical information can then be used to show how systems have been working  the advantage of wsns over conventional loggers is the  live  data feed that is possible 
water waste water monitoring  
monitoring the quality and level of water includes many activities such as checking the quality of underground or surface water and ensuring a countrys water infrastructure for the benefit of both human and animal  it may be used to protect the wastage of water

design
cross-layer is becoming an important studying area for wireless communications  in addition  the traditional layered approach presents three main problems 
traditional layered approach cannot share different information among different layers  which leads to each layer not having complete information  the traditional layered approach cannot guarantee the optimization of the entire network 
the traditional layered approach does not have the ability to adapt to the environmental change 
because of the interference between the different users  access conflicts  fading  and the change of environment in the wireless sensor networks  traditional layered approach for wired networks is not applicable to wireless networks 
so the cross-layer can be used to make the optimal modulation to improve the transmission performance  such as   energy efficiency  qos     etc   sensor nodes can be imagined as small computers which are extremely basic in terms of their interfaces and their components  they usually consist of a processing unit with limited computational power and limited memory  sensors or
 including specific conditioning circuitry   a communication device  usually radio transceivers or alternatively    and a power source usually in the form of a battery  other possible inclusions are
modules  secondary   and possibly secondary communication interface  e g 
or   
the base stations are one or more components of the wsn with much more computational  energy and communication resources  they act as a gateway between sensor nodes and the end user as they typically forward data from the wsn on to a server  other special components in
based networks are routers  designed to compute  calculate and distribute the routing tables 
platforms  
hardware  
main article 
one major challenge in a wsn is to produce low cost and tiny sensor nodes  there are an increasing number of small companies producing wsn hardware and the commercial situation can be compared to home computing in the 1970s  many of the nodes are still in the research and development stage  particularly their software  also inherent to sensor network adoption is the use of very low power methods for radio communication and data acquisition 
in many applications  a wsn communicates with a
or
through a gateway  the gateway acts as a bridge between the wsn and the other network  this enables data to be stored and processed by devices with more resources  for example  in a remotely located  
software  
energy is the scarcest resource of wsn nodes  and it determines the lifetime of wsns  wsns may be deployed in large numbers in various environments  including remote and hostile regions  where ad hoc communications are a key component  for this reason  algorithms and protocols need to address the following issues 
increased lifespan
robustness and fault tolerance
self-configuration
lifetime maximization  energy power consumption of the sensing device should be minimized and sensor nodes should be energy efficient since their limited energy resource determines their lifetime  to conserve power  wireless sensor nodes normally power off both the radio transmitter and the radio receiver when not in use 
operating systems  
for wireless sensor network nodes are typically less complex than general-purpose operating systems  they more strongly resemble   for two reasons  first  wireless sensor networks are typically deployed with a particular application in mind  rather than as a general platform  second  a need for low costs and low power leads most wireless sensor nodes to have low-power microcontrollers ensuring that mechanisms such as virtual memory are either unnecessary or too expensive to implement 
it is therefore possible to use embedded operating systems such as
or
for sensor networks  however  such operating systems are often designed with real-time properties 
is perhaps the first operating system specifically designed for wireless sensor networks  tinyos is based on an
model instead of   tinyos programs are composed of event handlers and tasks with run-to-completion semantics  when an external event occurs  such as an incoming data packet or a sensor reading  tinyos signals the appropriate event handler to handle the event  event handlers can post tasks that are scheduled by the tinyos kernel some time later 
is a newly developed os for wireless sensor networks  which provides unix-like abstraction and support for the c programming language 
is an os which uses a simpler programming style in c while providing advances such as
and  
online collaborative sensor data management platforms  
online collaborative sensor data management platforms are on-line database services that allow sensor owners to register and connect their devices to feed data into an online database for storage and also allow developers to connect to the database and build their own applications based on that data  examples include
and the   such platforms simplify online collaboration between users over diverse data sets ranging from energy and environment data to that collected from transport services  other services include allowing developers to embed real-time graphs   widgets in websites  analyse and process historical data pulled from the data feeds  send real-time alerts from any datastream to control scripts  devices and environments 
the architecture of the wikisensing system describes the key components of such systems to include apis and interfaces for online collaborators  a middleware containing the business logic needed for the sensor data management and processing and a storage model suitable for the efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data  0525162632
simulation of wsns  
at present  agent-based modeling and simulation is the only paradigm which allows the simulation of complex behavior in the environments of wireless sensors  such as flocking   agent-based simulation of wireless sensor and ad hoc networks is a relatively new paradigm 
was originally based on social simulation 
network simulators like  
and
can be used to simulate a wireless sensor network 
other concepts  
distributed sensor network  
if a centralised architecture is used in a sensor network and the central node fails  then the entire network will collapse  however the reliability of the sensor network can be increased by using a distributed control architecture  distributed control is used in wsns for the following reasons 
sensor nodes are prone to failure 
for better collection of data 
to provide nodes with backup in case of failure of the central node 
there is also no centralised body to allocate the resources and they have to be self organized 
data integration and sensor web  
the data gathered from wireless sensor networks is usually saved in the form of numerical data in a central base station  additionally  the
 ogc  is specifying standards for interoperability interfaces and metadata encodings that enable real time integration of heterogeneous sensor webs into the internet  allowing any individual to monitor or control wireless sensor networks through a web browser 
in-network processing  
to reduce communication costs some algorithms remove or reduce nodes  redundant sensor information and avoid forwarding data that is of no use  as nodes can inspect the data they forward  they can measure averages or directionality for example of readings from other nodes  for example  in sensing and monitoring applications  it is generally the case that neighboring sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values  this kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining
