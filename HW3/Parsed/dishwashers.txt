a dishwasher containing clean dishes
an open dishwasher
a dishwasher is a mechanical device for cleaning
and   unlike   which relies largely on physical scrubbing to remove soiling  the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water  typically between 55 and 75c  130 and 170f   at the dishes  with lower temperatures used for delicate items 
a mix of water and
is circulated by a pump  water is pumped to one or more rotating spray arms  which blast the dishes with the cleaning mixture  once the wash is finished  the water is drained  more hot water is pumped in and a rinse cycle begins  after the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained  the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods  e g  a
at the bottom of the tub  fans 
based drying  etc    typically a rinse aid is used to eliminate water spots for streak-free dishes and glassware 
large heavy-duty dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments  e g  hotels  restaurants  where a large number of dishes must be cleaned  washing is conducted with 6571c   150160f temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide the machine 82c   180f  final rinse  temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer 
dishwashers can be found in
and private homes

history  
a hand-powered dishwasher and an early electric dishwasher both from about 1917 
the first reports of a mechanical dishwashing device are of an 1850 patent in the
by
for a hand-powered wood device  this device was made of wood and was cranked by hand while water sprayed onto the dishes  this device was both slow and unreliable  another patent was granted to  l a  alexander  in 1865 that was similar to the first but featured a hand-cranked rack system  neither device was practical or widely accepted 
the first reliable  handpowered  dishwasher was invented in 1887 by
with the help of
and was unveiled at the 1893
  cochrane was quite wealthy and never washed dishes herself  she reportedly invented the dishwasher because her servants were chipping her fine china 
advertisement in an 1896 issue of
for the faultless quaker dishwasher 
europe s first domestic dishwasher with an electric motor was invented and manufactured by
in 1929  in the  
invented a small  non-electric dishwasher suitable for domestic use in 1924  it was the first dishwasher that incorporated most of the design elements that are featured in the models of today  it included a front door for loading  a wire rack to hold the dirty crockery and a rotating sprayer  drying elements were even added to his design in 1940  it was the first machine suitable for domestic use  and it came at a time when permanent plumbing and running water in the house was becoming increasingly common 
despite this  liven s design did not become a commercial success  and dishwashers were only successfully sold as domestic utilities in the
of the 1950s  albeit only to the wealthy  initially dishwashers were sold as standalone or portable devices  but with the development of the wall-to-wall
and standardized height cabinets  dishwashers began to be marketed with standardized sizes and shapes  integrated underneath the kitchen countertop as a modular unit with other kitchen appliances 
by the 1970s dishwashers had become commonplace in domestic residences in north america and western europe  by 2012  over 75 percent of homes in the us and germany had dishwashers 
design  
size and capacity  
north american counter-top dishwasher
dishwashers that are installed into standard kitchen cabinets have a standard width and depth of 60cm  europe  or 24inches  us   and most dishwashers must be installed into a hole a minimum of 86cm  europe  or 34inches  us  tall  portable dishwashers exist in 45 and 60cm  europe  or 18 and 24inch  us  widths  with casters and attached countertops  dishwashers may come in standard or tall tub designs  standard tub dishwashers have a service kickplate beneath the dishwasher door that allows for simpler maintenance and installation  but tall tub dishwashers have approximately 20  more capacity and better
from having a continuous front door 
the international standard for the capacity of a dishwasher is expressed as standard   commercial dishwashers are rated as plates per hour  the rating is based on standard sized plates of the same size  the same can be said for commercial glass washers  as they are based on standard glasses  normally pint glasses 
layout  
present-day machines feature a drop-down front panel door  allowing access to the interior  which usually contains two or sometimes three pull-out racks  racks can also be referred to as  baskets   in older u s  models from the 1950s  the entire tub rolled out when the machine latch was opened  and loading removing washable items was from the top  with the user reaching deep into the compartment for some items  youngstown kitchens  which manufactured entire kitchen cabinets and sinks  offered a tub-style dishwasher  which was coupled to a conventional kitchen sink as one unit 
today   dish drawer  models mimic this style  while the half-depth design eliminates the inconvenience of the long reach that was necessary with older full-depth models   cutlery baskets  are also common  a   first introduced by
in 1997  is a variant of the dishwasher in which the baskets slide out with the door in the same manner as a drawer   with each drawer in a double-drawer model being able to operate independently of the other 
the inside of a dishwasher in the north american market is either
or plastic  stainless steel tubs resist   provide better sound damping  and preserve heat to dry dishes more quickly  they also come at a premium price  older models used
on steel and are prone to chipping and erosion  chips in the baked enamel finish must be cleaned of all dirt and corrosion then patched with a special compound or even a good quality two-part   all european-made dishwashers feature a stainless steel interior as standard  even on low end models  the same is true for a built-in water softener 
washing elements  
the flutes  or valve meters  of the dishwasher are prevalent in american models  with some appearing in european and asian models influenced by us design  due to the higher pressure of the american water system  which averages at 90 torrs min  as opposed to the 65 torrs min pressure in other countries   the flutes help drain the excess water  preventing entropy within the system due to higher pressures at a lower volume  this is a removable fixture  as some areas require a higher or lower discharge based on their water system 
european dishwashers almost universally use two or three spray arms which are fed from the bottom and back wall of the dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters  removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them  many north american dishwashers tend to use more basic and old fashioned water distribution and exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher  some north american machines use a large cone or similar structure in the bottom dish rack to prevent placement of dishes in the center of the rack  the dishwasher directs water from the bottom of the dishwasher up through this structure to the upper wash arm to spray water on the top dish rack  some dishwashers  including many models from
and   use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher  which allows full use of the bottom rack  late-model
dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm  again allowing full use of the bottom rack  but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear  
features  
clear model of a running dishwasher
mid-to-higher end north american dishwashers often come with hard food disposal units  which behave like miniature
units that eliminate large pieces of food waste from the wash water  one manufacturer that is known for omitting hard food disposals is   a german brand  however  bosch does so in order to reduce noise  if the larger items of food waste are removed before placing in the dishwasher  pre-rinsing is not necessary even without integrated waste disposal units 
many new dishwashers feature -controlled  -assisted wash cycles that adjust the wash duration to the quantity of dirty dishes  sensed by changes in water   or the amount of dirt in the rinse water  sensed chemically optically   this can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load  in such dishwashers the
often used to control the washing cycle is replaced by a microprocessor but most sensors and
are still required to be present  however  pressure switches  some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter  are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water  when it senses there is no
it knows it has the optimal amount of water  a
or
opens the detergent door during the wash cycle 
some dishwashers include a child-lockout feature to prevent accidental starting or stopping of the wash cycle by children  a child lock can sometimes be included to prevent young children opening the door during a wash cycle  this prevents accidents with hot water and strong detergents used during the wash cycle 
cleaning agents  
detergent  
a detergent tablet
different kinds of dishwashing
contain different combinations of ingredients  common ingredients include 
bind calcium and magnesium ions to prevent  hard-water  type limescale deposits  they can cause ecological damage  so their use is starting to be phased out  phosphate-free detergents are sold as eco-friendly detergents 
oxygen-based
 older-style powders and liquids contain chlorine-based bleaching agents 
break up and bleach organic deposits 
non-ionic
lower the surface tension of the water  emulsifies oil  lipid and fat food deposits  prevents
on drying 
these are a primary component  in older and original-style dishwasher detergent powders     highly alkaline salts attack and dissolve grease  but are extremely corrosive  fatal  if swallowed  salts used may include    
etc 
break up   and possibly oil  lipid and fat deposits  proteases do this by breaking down the proteins into smaller peptides that are more easily washed away    
often   this prevents corrosion of dishwasher components    
dishwashing detergent may also contain   
foam interferes with the washing action 
additives to slow down the removal of glaze   patterns from glazed ceramics
anti-caking agents  in granular detergent 
 in tablet based detergents 
gelling agents  in liquid gel based detergents 
sand  inexpensive powdered detergents 
dishwasher detergents are strongly
   
inexpensive powders may contain sand  which can be verified by dissolving the powder in boiling water and then passing the solution through a   such detergents may harm the dishes and the dishwasher  powdered detergents are more likely to cause fading on china patterns 
besides older style detergents for dishwashers 
detergents also exist for dishwashers  these detergents may be more environmentally friendly than conventional detergents 
hand-washing dish detergent  washing up liquid  creates a large foam of bubbles which will leak from the dishwasher 
rinse aid  
rinse aid  sometimes called rinse agent  contains
and uses
to prevent droplet formation  so that water drains from the surfaces in thin sheets  rather than forming droplets   
the benefits of using it are that it prevents  spotting  on glassware  caused by droplets of water drying and leaving behind dissolved
minerals   and can also improve drying performance as there is less water remaining to be dried  a thinner sheet of water also has a much larger surface-area than a droplet of the same volume  which increases the likelihood of water molecules  
dishwasher salt  
main article 
in some countries  especially those in europe  dishwashers include a built-in
that removes
and
ions from the water    which is coarse-grained sodium chloride     is used to recharge the resin in the built-in ion-exchange system  the coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit  unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes  it does not contain added insoluble
or magnesium salts  the presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener  anticaking agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium  table salt may contain added iodine in the form of sodium iodide or potassium iodide  these compounds will not affect the ion-exchange system  but adding table salt to the dishwasher s water softening unit can damage it 
if a dishwasher has a built-in water softener there will be a special compartment inside the dishwasher where the salt is to be added when needed  this salt compartment is separate from the detergent compartment  and generally located at the bottom of the wash cabinet  this is below the bottom basket   on most dishwashers  an automatic sensing system will notify the user when more dishwasher salt is required 
if the dishwasher has run out of the salt that recharges the
that softens the water  and the water supply is  hard   limescale deposits can appear on all items  but are especially visible on glassware 
effects on crockery  
glassware  
glassware washed by dishwashing machines can develop a white
on the surface over time  this may be caused by any or all of the below processes  only one of which is reversible 
silicate filming  etching  and accelerated crack corrosion
this film starts as an iridescence or  oil-film  effect on glassware  and progresses into a  milky  or  cloudy  appearance  which is not a deposit  that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale  it is formed because the detergent is strongly alkaline  basic  and glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution  it becomes less soluble in the presence of silicates in the water  added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the dishwasher detergent   since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution  it is  somewhat paradoxically  less marked if dissolution is higher  i e  if a silicate-free detergent is used  also  in certain cases  the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks as a result of the items  manufacturing  limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness  detergent load and temperature  the type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem  some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed 
devitrification
components found in dishwasher detergents can chemically scour the glass  causing tiny crystals  which can precipitate further crystal growth that can turn entire glasses cloudy
unsuitable items  
should not be cleaned in a dishwasher as the corrosive effect of dishwasher detergent is high on such types of glass  that is  it will quickly go  cloudy   in addition  the lead in the crystal glass can be converted into a soluble form  which could endanger the health of subsequent users  some items can be damaged if washed in a dishwasher because of the effects of the chemicals and hot water  aluminium items will discolor  saucepan manufacturers often recommend handwashing due to the harsh effects of the chemicals on the pan coatings  valuable items  such as antiques or hand-painted items  should only be washed manually as they may be dulled or damaged  and detergents will gradually fade the glazing and print  sterling silver and pewter will oxidize and discolour from the heat  furthermore  pewter has a low melting point and may warp in some dishwashers 
items soiled by wax  cigarette ash or anything which might contaminate the rest of the wash load  such as poisons or mineral oils  should be washed by hand  objects contaminated by
may explode in a dishwasher  glued items  such as some cutlery handles or wooden   may be melted or softened if put in a dishwasher  especially on a hot wash cycle when temperatures can reach 75c  167f   these high temperatures can also damage plastic items which are designated as only being washed by hand  some plastic items can be distorted or melted if placed in the bottom rack too close to an exposed   therefore  most dishwasher-safe plastic items recommend placing in the top rack only  many newer dishwashers have a concealed heating element away from the bottom rack entirely   squeezing plastic items into small spaces may cause the plastic to distort in shape 
dishwashers should only be used to wash normal household items  such as plates  cutlery  cups  mugs  kitchenware etc  items such as paintbrushes  tools  furnace filters etc  should not be put into a dishwasher as this will cause the subsequent washes to become contaminated and may cause damage to the appliance 
knives and other cooking tools that are made of   semi-stainless steels like d2 or specialized  highly hardened cutlery steels like zdp189 should also not be placed into a dishwasher  as these steels are not corrosion resistant or far less corrosion resistant than the austenitic stainless steels used for cookware  also  very sharp edges can become dulled or damaged from colliding with other items and or thermal stress from the washing cycles  and can pose an injury hazard if another person unloading the dishwasher does not expect such items in the dishwasher  ceramic edges are very brittle and can take damage from collision with dishwasher parts or other contents 
is normally seasoned with oil or grease and heat  which causes the oil or grease to be absorbed into the pores of the cookware  thereby giving a smooth relatively non-stick cooking surface  such cookware should not be washed in a dishwasher as the combination of alkali based detergent and hot water will strip off this cooking surface  requiring reseasoning before the item may once again be used 
process  
drying  
the heat inside the dishwasher dries the contents after the final hot rinse  the final rinse adds a small amount of rinse aid to the hot water  as this improves drying significantly  plastic and non-stick items may not dry properly compared to china and glass  which hold the heat better  some dishwashers incorporate a fan to improve drying  older dishwashers with a visible heating element  at the bottom of the wash cabinet  below the bottom basket  may use the heating element to improve drying  however  this uses more energy 
north american dishwashers tend to use heat-assisted drying via an exposed element  european machines and some high end north american machines use passive methods for drying  a stainless steel interior helps this process and some models use heat exchange technology between the inner and outer skin of the machine to cool the walls of the interior and speed up drying  most dishwashers feature a drying sensor and as such  a dish-washing cycle is always considered complete when a drying indicator  usually in the form of an illuminated  end  light  or in more modern models on a digital display or audible sound  exhibits to the operator that the washing and drying cycle is now over 
governmental agencies often recommend air-drying dishes by either disabling or stopping the drying cycle to save energy 
efficiency  
most consumer dishwashers use a 75c  167f  thermostat in the sanitizing process  during the final rinse cycle  the heating element and wash pump are turned on  and the cycle timer  electronic or electromechanical  is stopped until the thermostat is tripped  at this point  the cycle timer resumes and will generally trigger a drain cycle within a few timer increments 
most consumer dishwashers use 75c  167f  rather than 83c  181f  for reasons of burn risk  energy and water consumption  total cycle time  and possible damage to plastic items placed inside the dishwasher  with new advances in detergents  lower water temperatures  5055c   122131f  are needed to prevent premature decay of the enzymes used to eat the grease and other build-ups on the dishes 
in the us  residential dishwashers can be certified to a
testing protocol which confirms the cleaning and sanitation performance of the unit 
a 2009 study showed that the microwave and the dishwasher were both effective ways to clean  
adoption  
commercial use  
a commercial dishwasher
a hobart commercial dishwasher
large heavy-duty dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments  e g  hotels  restaurants  where a large number of dishes must be cleaned 
unlike a residential dishwasher  a commercial dishwasher does not utilize a drying cycle  commercial drying is achieved by heated ware meeting open air once the wash rinse sanitation cycles have been completed  and thus are significantly faster than their residential counterparts  washing is conducted with 6571c   150160f temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide the machine 82c   180f  final rinse  temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer  this distinction labels the machines as either  high-temp  or  low-temp  
some commercial dishwashers work similarly to a commercial   with a pulley system that pulls the rack through a small chamber  known widely as a  rack conveyor  systems   single-rack washers require an operator to push the rack into the washer  close the doors  start the cycle  and then open the doors to pull out the cleaned rack  possibly through a second opening into an unloading area 
in the uk  the
set standards for dishwashers  in the us 
 an independent not-for-profit organization  sets the standards for wash and rinse time along with minimum water temperature for chemical or hot water sanitizing methods  there are many types of commercial dishwashers including under counter  single tank  conveyor  flight type  and carousel machines 
commercial dishwashers often have significantly different plumbing and operations than a home unit  in that there are often separate spray arms for washing and rinsing sanitizing  the wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution  and is used repeatedly from one load to the next  the wash tank usually has a large strainer basket to collect food debris  and the strainer may not be emptied until the end of the day s kitchen operations 
water used for rinsing and sanitizing is generally delivered directly through building water supply  and is not reusable  the used rinse water falls into the wash tank reservoir  which dilutes some of the used wash water and causes a small amount to drain out through an overflow tube  the system may first rinse with pure water only  and then sanitize with an additive solution that is left on the dishes as they leave the washer to dry 
additional soap is periodically added to the main wash water tank  from either large soap concentrate tanks or dissolved from a large solid soap block  to maintain wash water cleaning effectiveness 
environmental impact  
the dishwasher has made cleaning and drying dishes much easier and more efficient  in the european union  the energy consumption of a dishwasher for a standard usage is shown on a   in the united states  the energy consumption of a dishwasher is defined using the  
comparing the efficiency of automatic dishwashers and hand-washing of dishes is difficult because hand-washing techniques vary drastically by individual  according to a peer-reviewed study in 2003  hand washing and drying of an amount of dishes equivalent to a fully loaded automatic dishwasher  no   could use between 20300 litres  5.379.3usgal  of water and between 0.1 and 8 kwh of energy  while the numbers for energy-efficient automatic dishwashers were 1522 litres  4.05.8usgal  and 1 to 2 kwh  respectively  the study concluded that fully loaded dishwashers use less energy  water  and detergent than the average european hand-washer  for the automatic dishwasher results  the dishes were not rinsed before being loaded  the study does not address costs associated with the manufacture and disposal of dishwashers  the cost of possible accelerated wear of dishes from the chemical harshness of dishwasher detergent  the comparison for cleaning cookware  or the value of labour saved  hand washers needed between 65 and 106 minutes  several points of criticism on this study have been raised  for example 
of electricity were compared against energy used for heating hot water without taking into account possible inefficiencies  also  inefficient human washers were compared against optimal usage of a fully loaded dishwasher without manual pre-rinsing that can take up to 100 litres  26usgal  of water 
most dishwasher detergent contains   as they have several properties that aid in effective cleaning  however  the same chemicals have been removed from laundry detergents in many countries as a result of concerns raised about the increase in
in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels  see    17 us states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent  and 2 us states
and
ban phosphates in commercial dishwashing  detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans  although detergents are typically formulated for local markets   and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents 
in addition  rinse aids have contained
and nonylphenol ethoxylates  these have been banned in the european union by eu directive 76/769 eec 
alternative uses  
dishwashers can be used to cook certain foods  in particular salmon
