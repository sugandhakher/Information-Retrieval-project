in honduras  there is an important potential of untapped indigenous
resources  due to the variability of high oil prices and declining renewable infrastructure costs  such resources could be developed at competitive prices 
currently hydropower  solar and biomass are used on a large scale for electricity generation  while the potential of large generation from
and geothermal energy has been studied in detail  the potential for the development of other renewable energy resources is yet to be explored in depth

legal and policy framework  
decrees no  85-98 and 267-98 promote the development of renewable energy-generating plants  the decrees include tax breaks to developers and a secure buyer for energy at prices equivalent to the systems short-term marginal cost  the national integrated utility enee  which is the default buyer  must pay a premium  10 percent of the same short-run   for the electricity generated when the installed capacity is below 50   this framework has facilitated the negotiation of about 30 public private partnerships with enee for small renewable energy plants  in addition  decree no  85-98 also establishes tax exemptions in favor of developers  import and salestaxes on equipment  and a five-year income tax holiday 
the penetration of renewable energy technologies into
programs is still lagging behind due to a lack of clear and consistent policy framework in the field  as a result  most of the rural electrification activities are still grid extensions 
current use and potential  
hydropower  
currently  33 percent  502 mw  of the installed capacity of the national interconnected system is hydro plants  there has been an intensive use of small- and medium-scale hydro energy  with 14 out of 16 existing hydro plants with capacity below 30 mw  two large plants   and   account  however  for more than 70  of the total capacity 
in honduras  there is a large potential for electricity generation based on   in 2003 then president
put in place a special commission for the development of hydroelectric projects 
there are 16 new hydro projects that are expected to be commissioned before 2011  with an overall capacity of 206.5 mw  the two largest projects are the cangrejal and patuca 3  there are also other large hydropower project that are not included in the power expansion plan  these large projects have attracted some criticism  some of the most prominent projects are 
cangrejal  this planned dam on the rio cangrejal near   with an associated 40 mw power plant  has attracted international criticism due to its potential environmental impact  including the flooding of rapids that are a well-known whitewater sports destination and attract many tourists
patuca 3  the patuca 3 dam on the
in the department of   with an associated 100 mw power plant  is to be built in a protected area that is part of the
and is inhabited by indigenous people whose livelihoods would be affected 
los llanitos  the los llanitos hydroelectric power project is planned on the   the plant was initially expected to have a capacity between 94 and 135 mw  but has later been reduced to 50 mw  initial plans had been drawn up as part of the sula valley water management plan  but the project had not been implemented 
the jicatuyo dam  170 mw  on the river of the same name  a tributary of the  
concerning medium-size and small dams  private developers receive tax breaks  specifically  private producers are benefiting from fiscal incentives  tax exemptions  and the recognition of 10 percent of the short-term marginal cost per kwh as a premium  fiscal incentives for small and medium-size hydropower have created a bias toward this type of development and against other renewable options  such as the use of photovoltaic  wind  and geothermal systems 
in 2015  the 38.5 mw la vegona hydropower plant came online as well as 10.8 mw of smaller projects 
wind  
due to the diversity of the honduran landscape  the potential for wind development varies considerably  a 100 mw wind project was built in 2012  finance was agreed with us exim bank in mid 2010  exim bank project reference ap083987xx   this project  sponsored by   is located in   in the municipalities of santa ana and san buenaventura  20km south of   mesoamerica seems to be actively controlled by the actis infrastructure fund  a 24 mw expansion of this wind farm was completed in 2014  a 50 mw wind plant was built in 2014 in  
solar  
in 2015  honduras ranked as the second largest producer of solar electricity in latin america  behind chile  but ahead of mexico   honduras has a large potential for solar
generation  in fact  it is a practical solution for servicing energy-isolated rural communities  in 2007  there were about 5,000 individual solar home systems  with an average size between 30 wp and 50 wp  which makes up for a total capacity of approximately 15 to 25kw of power  the government utility 
 enee   offered 20-year guaranteed contracts for utility scale solar farms  this resulted in 23 solar farms being approved in 2014 for a total of 609mw and will represent an investment of 1.6 billion us dollars  the ten parks totaling 300mw which came online by july 31  2015 got a bonus 
examples of solar farms 
144 mw solar park in
61.5 mw aura ii pv solar plant
35.1 mw choluteca ii
23.3 mw pacfico
23.3 mw choluteca i
an additional 250 mw of solar power are expected to come online in 2015 including another 50 mw project in nacaome 
biomass  
honduras has a large potential for electricity generation from   mainly from the sugar industry  currently  there are nine biomass projects in operation  with a total of 81.75 mw installed capacity  these plants are estimated to supply 2.3 percent of the total demand of energy in honduras for 2007 
geothermal  
the three planned
projects in honduras add up to 85.5 mw of installed capacity  the largest of them is called platanares  in the department of copan  which is expected to begin operations in 2011 with an installed capacity of 40.5 mw and a generation of 354.8 gwh per year
