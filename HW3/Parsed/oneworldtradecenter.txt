the first one world trade center under construction in 1971
the construction of the world trade center  of which the twin towers  one and
world trade center  were the centerpieces  was conceived as an
project and spearheaded by   the project was intended to help revitalize   the project was planned by the   which hired architect   yamasaki came up with the idea of building twin towers  after extensive negotiations  the
and
governments  which supervise the port authority  consented to the construction of the world trade center at the
site  located in the lower-west area of   to satisfy the new jersey government  the port authority agreed to buy the bankrupt hudson   manhattan railroad  renamed to    which transported commuters from new jersey to lower manhattan 
the towers were designed as   giving tenants open floor plans  unobstructed by columns or walls  this design was accomplished by using many closely spaced perimeter columns  providing much of the structure s strength  with the gravity load shared with the core columns  the
system  which made use of
and a system of express and local elevators  allowed substantial floor space to be used for office purposes by making the structural core smaller  the design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques  such as
experiments and the
for digging the  
construction of the north tower  one world trade center  began in august 1966  extensive use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process  the first tenants moved into the north tower in december 1970  in the 1970s  four other low-level buildings were built as part of the world trade center complex  a
building was built in the mid-1980s 
specifications and operations
after
was built in the 1980s  the world trade center complex had a total of seven buildings  however  the most notable ones were the main twin towers built in the 1970sone world trade center was the north tower  and
was the south tower  each tower was over 1,350 feet  410m  high  and occupied about 1 acre  0.40ha  of the total 16 acres  6.5ha  of  s land  during a press conference in 1973  yamasaki was asked   why two 110-story buildings  why not one 220-story building   his response was   i didn t want to lose the human scale  
when completed in 1972  one world trade center became the tallest building in the world for two years  surpassing the   which had held the record for 40 years  the north tower was 1,368 feet  417m  tall  and in 1978  a telecommunications antenna was added to the top of the roof  by itself  the antenna was 360 feet  110m  tall  with the 360-foot  110m -tall antenna  the highest point of the north tower reached 1,728ft  527m   the tower held its record for a brief period of time  chicago s   finished in may 1973  was 1,450 feet  440m  at the rooftop  at 110 floors  the world trade center towers had
than any other building at that time  this number was not surpassed until the construction of the
 163 floors   which opened in 2010 
of the 110 stories  eight were set aside as
 floors 7/8  41/42  75/76  and 108/109   which were four two-floor areas that were spaced up the building in even intervals  all the remaining floors were open for tenants  each floor of the tower had 40,000 square feet  3,700m2  of available space  the north and south tower had 3,800,000 square feet  350,000m2  of total office space  the entire complex of seven buildings had a combined total of 13,400,000 square feet  1,240,000m2  of office space

the complex initially failed to attract the expected clientele  during the early years  various governmental organizations became key tenants of the world trade center  such as the   in the 1980s  the city s perilous financial condition eased  after which an increasing number of private companiesmostly financial firms related to became tenants  during the 1990s  approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex  including financial companies such as     and   the basement concourse of the world trade center included   and a   the north tower became the main corporate headquarters of   and it also became the headquarters of the  
the tower s electrical service was supplied by
 coned  at 13,800volts  the electricity passed through the world trade center primary distribution center  pdc   and was then sent up the building s core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors  the substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts  and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services  the complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of five world trade center 
the 110th floor of one world trade center  the north tower  housed radio and television transmission equipment  the roof of the north tower contained a vast array of transmission antennas  including the 360 feet  110m  center antenna mast  rebuilt by dielectric inc  to support
in 1999  the center mast contained the television signals for almost all nyc television broadcasters  2  4  5  7  9   11  13   31 and 47   it also had four nyc fm broadcasters  93.1  93.9  89.9  and 103.5  access to the roof was controlled by the wtc operations control center  occ   located in the b1 level of the south tower  after the
of 2001  the broadcasting equipment for the radio and television stations was moved to the  
on a typical weekday  a combined total of 50,000 people worked in the north and south towers  with another 200,000 passing through as visitors  the complex was so large that it had its own zip code    the
restaurant  located on top of the north tower  reported revenues of  37 million in 2000  making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the united states  the twin towers became known worldwide  appearing in movies  television shows  postcards  and other merchandise  the towers came to be seen as a new york city icon  much like the empire state building  the   and the  
incidents
on february 13  1975  a
broke out on the 11th floor of the north tower  fire spread through the core of the building to the 9th and 14th floors  as the insulation for telephone cables  located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors  had been ignited  areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately  and the original fire was put out in a few hours  most of the damage was on the 11th floor  where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper  alcohol-based fluid for office machines  and other office equipment 
protected the steel  and there was no structural damage to the tower  in addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors  water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below  at the time  the world trade center complex had no

the first terrorist attack on the world trade center   at 12 17p m   when a
truck filled with 1,500 pounds  680kg  of explosives  planted by   detonated in the underground garage of the north tower  the blast resulted in a 100 feet  30m  hole through five sublevels  the greatest damage was on levels b1 and b2  with significant structural damage on level b3  six people were killed  and more than a thousand were injured  as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time  many people inside the north tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no emergency lighting  and some took two hours or more to reach safety

planning and early development
following the destruction of the original world trade center  there was debate regarding the future of the world trade center site  there were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately  and by 2002  the
had organized a competition to determine how to use the site  the proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the september 11 attacks and rebuild the complex  when the public rejected the first round of designs  a second  more open competition took place in december 2002  in which a design by
was selected as the winner  this design went through many revisions  mainly because of disagreements with developer   who held the lease to the world trade center site at that time 
there was criticism concerning the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan  only 82 floors would have been habitable  and the total office space of the rebuilt world trade center complex would have been reduced by more than 3,000,000 square feet  280,000m2  in comparison with the original complex  the floor limit was imposed by silverstein  who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident  much of the building s height would have consisted of a large  open-air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower  containing wind turbines and  sky gardens   in a subsequent design  the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original world trade center  and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans  in 2002  former
faced accusations of
for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect s design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor  ron lauder 
a final design for the  freedom tower  was formally unveiled on june 28  2005  to address security issues raised by the   a 187-foot  57m  concrete base was added to the design in april of that year  the design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a  concrete bunker   however  the prisms were later found to be unworkable  as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards  as a result  it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast-resistant glass 
contrasting with libeskind s original plan  the tower s final design tapers octagonally as it rises  its designers stated that the tower would be a  monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna   in 2006  larry silverstein commented on a planned completion date   by 2012 we should have a completely rebuilt world trade center  more magnificent  more spectacular than it ever was   on april 26  2006  the port authority of new york and new jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin  a formal agreement was drafted the following day  the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the   construction began in may  a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived

one world trade center tower construction as of august 7  2007
one world trade center construction as of april 3  2012  three months before topping off
the symbolic cornerstone of one world trade center was laid in a ceremony on july 4  2004  the stone had an inscription supposedly written by   however  construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money  security  and design  the last major issues were resolved on april 26  2006  when a deal was made between developer
and the port authority of new york and new jersey  so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on june 23  2006  soon after  explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear
for the building s foundation  onto which 400 cubic yards  310 cubic meters  of concrete was poured by november 2007 
in a december 18  2006  ceremony held in nearby   members of the public were invited to sign the first 30-foot  9.1m  steel beam installed onto the building s base  it was welded onto the building s base on december 19  2006  foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward  so the tower s footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year 
in january 2008  two cranes were moved onto the site  construction of the tower s concrete core  which began after the cranes arrived  reached street level by may 17  however  construction of the base was not finished until two years later  after which construction of the office floors began  and the first glass windows were subsequently installed  during 2010  floors were constructed at a rate of about one per week  an advanced  cocoon  scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling  and was the first such safety system installed on a steel structure in the city  the tower reached 52 floors and was over 600 feet  180m  tall by december 2010  the tower s steel frame was halfway complete by then  but grew to 82 floors by the tenth anniversary of the september 11 attacks  at which time its concrete flooring had reached 72 floors and the glass cladding had reached 56 floors 
in 2009  the port authority changed the official name of the building from  freedom tower  to  one world trade center   stating that this name was the  easiest for people to identify with   the change came after board members of the port authority voted to sign a 21-year lease deal with vantone industrial co   a chinese real estate company  which will become the building s first commercial tenant  vantone plans to create the china center  a trade and cultural facility  covering 191,000 square feet on floors 64 through 69 
detailed floor plans of the tower were posted on the new york city s department of finance website in may 2011  resulting in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area  who warned that the plans could potentially be used for a future terrorist attack 
while under construction  the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions  on the weekend of july 4  2011  it was lit up with the colors of the
to commemorate   and it was lit up with the same colors on september 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks  on october 27 of that same year  it was illuminated with pink in honor of   on december 11  the port authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the   on february 24  2012  the building was lit up with red in honor of
  who became a
on february 18  on june 14  2012  it was illuminated with red  white  and blue to honor   in august  it was illuminated with red in honor of the armed forces  on september 8  2012  it was once again illuminated with red  white  and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the september 11 attacks  on june 24  2013  the building was again illuminated with red  white  and blue to celebrate the   on november 12  2013  three hundred red  white  and blue lights were lit up 
the tower s loading dock  however  was not due to be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building  so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars  the temporary path station was not to be removed until its official replacement  the   was completed  blocking access to the planned loading area  by march 2012  one world trade center s steel structure had reached 93 floors  growing to 94 floors and 1,240 feet  380m  by the end of the month  however  because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements  the 94th floor was numbered  floor 100   because the extra space was occupied by the high-ceilinged 91st floor  which was used for mechanical purposes 
the still-incomplete tower became new york city s tallest building by roof height in april 2012  passing the 1,250-foot  380m  roof height of the   president
visited the construction site two months later and wrote  on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower  the sentence  we remember  we rebuild  we come back stronger   that same month  with the tower s structure nearing completion  the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building  seeking to attract visitors and tenants 
one world trade center s steel structure topped out at the nominal 104th floor  with a total height of 1,368 feet  417m   in august 2012  the tower s antenna was shipped to new york in november 2012  the first section of the antenna was hoisted to the top of the tower on december 12  2012  and was installed on january 15  2013  by march 2013  two sections of the antenna had been installed  the spire s completion was scheduled for april 29  2013  but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces  on may 10  2013  the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of one world trade center  bringing the tower to its full height of 1,776 feet  541m   and making it the   as well as the tallest in the city  surpassing the 1,454-foot  443m  empire state building  in subsequent months  the exterior elevator shaft was removed  the podium glass  interior decorations  and other finishings were being installed  and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed 
a report in september 2013 revealed that  at the time of the report  the world trade center association  wtca  was negotiating with regard to the  world trade center  name  as the wtca had purchased the rights to the name in 1986  the wtca sought  500,000 worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of  world trade center  in the tower s name and associated souvenirs 
on november 12  2013  the height committee of the -based
 ctbuh  made the controversial announcement that one world trade center was the
at 1,776 feet  declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building s architecture  by the same reasoning  the building was also the tallest in the western hemisphere

the building opened on november 3  2014  and cond nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors  cond nast occupies floors 20 to 44  having completed its move in early 2015  it is expected that the company will attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40  of unleased space in the tower  as cond nast had revitalized times square after moving there in 1999  only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day  future tenants will include kids creative  legends hospitality  the     and  
disabled suspended working platform used for maintenance activities on southern exposure
on november 12  2014  the supporting
cables of a suspended working platform slacked  the cables were manufactured by tractel  and they were used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the building s exterior  at the time  the platform was holding a two-man  -affiliated
team  the slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower  the workers were rescued by over 100   who used a
to cut through the glass  after the incident  the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia  and were taken to the hospital 
estimated cost and funding
an estimate in february 2007 placed the initial construction cost of one world trade center at about  3 billion  or  1,150 per square foot   12,380 per square meter   however  the tower s total estimated construction cost had risen to  3.9 billion by april 2012  making it the most expensive building in the world at the time  the tower s construction was partly funded by approximately  1billion of insurance money that silverstein received for his losses in the september 11 attacks  the state of new york provided an additional  250million  and the port authority agreed to give  1billion  which would be obtained through the sale of   the port authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds  with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015  however  the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower s construction 
architecture and design
preliminary site plans for the world trade center s reconstruction  in orange are the new buildings  one world trade center is the square at upper left   and in blue is the 9/11 memorial and museum 
many of  s original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower s final design  one world trade center s final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile  intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary new york skyline  the tower s central spire draws from previous buildings  such as the
and the   it also visually resembles the original twin towers  rather than being an off-center spire similar to the  
the building occupies a 200-foot  61m  square  with an area of 40,000 square feet  3,700m2   nearly identical to the footprints of the original twin towers  the tower is built upon a 185-foot  56m  tall windowless concrete base  designed to protect it from
and other ground-level attacks  originally  the base was to be covered in decorative
glass  but a simpler glass-and-steel faade was adopted when the prisms proved unworkable  the current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels  similar to those on  
lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night  cable-net glass faades on all four sides of the building for the higher floors  designed by schlaich bergermann  will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex  the faades are 60 feet  18m  high  and range in width from 30 feet  9.1m  on the east and west sides  50 feet  15m  on the north side  and 70 feet  21m  on the south side  the curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by benson industries in   using glass made in
by viracon 
from the 20th floor upwards  the square edges of the tower s cubic base are
back  shaping the building into eight tall   or an elongated   near its middle  the tower forms a perfect octagon  and then culminates in a glass   whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base  a 408-foot  124 m  sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna designed in a collaboration between
 som   artist
 who invented the
structure   lighting designers  and engineers is secured by a system of cables  and rises from a circular support ring  which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment  at night  an intense beam of light is projected horizontally from the spire and shines over 1,000 feet  300m  above the tower 
of som  the architect of one world trade center  said the following regarding the tower s design 
we really wanted our design to be grounded in something that was very real  not just in sculptural sketches  we explored the infrastructural challenges because the proper solution would have to be compelling  not just beautiful  the design does have great sculptural implications  and we fully understand the iconic importance of the tower  but it also has to be a highly efficient building  the discourse about freedom tower has often been limited to the symbolic  formal and aesthetic aspects but we recognize that if this building doesn t function well  if people don t want to work and visit there  then we will have failed as architects

design evolution
the original design went through significant changes after the
joined the port authority of new york and new jersey as the co-developer of the project in 2010 
height comparison of major skyscrapers in new york city  with one world trade center shown at far left  the north tower of wtc was 1,727 ft  526.3 m 
the 185-foot  56m  tall base corners were originally designed to gently slope upward  and have prismatic glass  the corners were later squared  in addition  the base s walls are now covered in  hundreds of pairs of 13-foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight-inch-wide stainless-steel slats  
the spire was originally to be enclosed with a protective   described as a  sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels   however  the radome-enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna    the chairman of the durst organization  stated that the design change would save  20 million  however  the tower s architect  skidmore owings   merrill  strongly criticized the change  david childs  the lead designer  said   eliminating this integral part of the building s design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate   we stand ready to work with the port on an alternate design   after joining the project in 2010  the durst organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs  but the proposal was rejected by the port authority s then-executive director    ward was replaced by
in september 2011  foye changed the port authority s position  and the radome was removed from the plans  in 2012  douglas durst gave a statement regarding the final decision    the antenna  is going to be mounted on the building over the summer  there s no way to do anything at this point  
the north pool of the
adjacent to one world trade center
the large triangular plaza on the west side of one world trade center  facing the   was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street  however  the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design  the terrace can be accessed through a staircase on vesey street  the terrace is paved in granite  and has 12 sweetgum trees  in addition to a block-long planter bench 
durst also removed a skylight from the plaza s plans  the skylight was designed to allow natural light to enter the below-ground observation deck lobby  the plaza is 5ft 8in  1.73m  higher than the adjacent sidewalk 
the port authority formally approved all these revisions  and the revisions were first reported by the   patrick foye  the executive director of the port authority  said that he thought that the changes were  few and minor  in a telephone interview 
a contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization states that the durst organization will receive a  15 million fee and a percentage of  base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project   the specifics of the signed contract give durst 75 percent of the savings  up to  24 million  with further returns going down to 50 percent  25 percent and 15 percent as the savings increase 
height
when viewed from street level in proximity to the tower  one world trade center  freedom tower  appears to ascend to a pyramid point  as seen in this view of the west street side of the building 
spire on the top of one world trade center building as viewed from the ground
the top floor of one world trade center is 1,368 feet  417m  above ground level  along with a 33ft 4in  10.16m    this is identical to the roof height of the original one world trade center  the tower s antenna spire brings it to a pinnacle height of 1,776 feet  541m   a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776  when the
was signed  if the antenna is included in the building s height  as stated by the
 ctbuh   one world trade center surpasses the height of
 1,671-foot  509m    is the world s tallest all-office building  and the fourth-tallest skyscraper in the world  behind the     and  
one world trade center is the second-tallest   as the
in
exceeds one world trade center s pinnacle height by approximately 12m  39.4ft   the   with a planned height of 2,000 feet  610m   was expected to exceed the height of one world trade center  but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in 2009 
after design changes for one world trade center s spire were revealed in may 2012  there were questions as to whether the 408-foot  124m -tall structure would still qualify as a spire  and thus be included in the building s height  since the tower s spire is not enclosed in a radome as originally planned  it could be classified as a simple antenna  which is not included in a building s height  according to the ctbuh  without the antenna  one world trade center would be 1,368 feet  417m  tall  making it the   behind the
and   both located in chicago  and
in new york  the building is currently the tallest in new york city with the antenna  however  without the antenna  it was surpassed in 2015 by   which topped out at 1,396 feet  426m  high  one world trade center s developers have disputed the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign  with port authority spokesman steve coleman reiterating that  one world trade center will be the tallest building in the western hemisphere   in 2012  the ctbuh announced that it would wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire would count towards the building s height  on november 12  2013  the ctbuh announced that one world trade center s spire would count as part of the building s recognized height  giving it a final height of 1,776feet  and making it the tallest building in the western hemisphere 
sustainability
like other buildings in the new world trade center complex  one world trade center includes
features  much of the building s structure and interior is built from recycled materials  including
boards and ceiling tiles  around 80percent of the tower s waste products are recycled  although the roof area of any tower is limited  the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems  the building s
generate 4.8megawatts  mw  of power  and its waste steam generates electricity  the
selected
to provide the tower s fuel cell system  which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed  the tower also makes use of off-site
and   the windows are made of an ultra-clear glass  which allows maximum sunlight to pass through  the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days  reducing energy costs  like all of the new facilities at the world trade center site  one world trade center is   with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site  one world trade center is expected to receive a
 leed  gold certification  making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world 
safety and security
security features
one world trade center and 7 world trade center at night
along with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base  a number of other safety features were included in the building s design  so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack  like   the building has 3-foot  91cm  thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells  elevator shafts  risers  and sprinkler systems  there are also extra-wide 
stairwells  along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters  and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system  in comparison  the original twin towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions  protected only by lightweight
panels 
the building is no longer 25 feet  8m  away from   as the twin towers were  at its closest point  west street is 65 feet  20m  away  the windows facing west street are equipped with specially tempered blast-resistant plastic  which looks almost like the glass used in the other sides of the building  the port authority has stated   its structure is designed around a strong 
steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected by a combination of welding and bolting  paired with a concrete-core shear wall  the moment frame lends substantial rigidity and redundancy to the overall building structure while providing column-free interior spans for maximum flexibility  
in addition to safety design  new security measures will be implemented  all vehicles will be screened for
materials and other potentially dangerous objects before they enter the site through the underground road  four hundred
will be placed in and around the site  with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the nypd  a computer system will use   designed to detect potential threats  such as unattended bags  and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects  new york city and port authority police will patrol the site 
once the world trade center site is fully completed  the plaza will be completely opened to the public  as the original world trade center plaza was  the initial stage of the opening process began on thursday  may 15  2014  when the  interim operating period  of the
ended  during this period  all visitors were required to undergo airport style security screening  as part of the  interim operating period   which was expected to end on december 31  2013  however  screening did not fully end until the official dedication and opening of the museum on may 21  2014  after which visitors were allowed to use the plaza without needing passes 
incidents
in march 2014  the tower was scaled by 16-year-old new jersey resident justin casquejo  who entered the site through a hole in a fence  he was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges  he allegedly dressed like a construction worker  sneaked in  and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the towers 88th floor  according to news sources  he then used stairways to get to the 104th floor  walked past a sleeping security guard  and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna  where he took pictures for two hours  the elevator operator was reassigned  and the guard was fired  it was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower  which facilitated casquejo s entry to the site 
less than a week after the trespassing incident  four peoplethree male parachutists  one of whom was a construction worker at the site  and their lookoutwere arrested for a
they conducted on september 30  2013  they had posted a video of the jump online  as a result of these incidents  the  s head of security at one world trade center  david velazquez  resigned on march 28  2014 
controversies
the social center of the previous one world trade center included a restaurant on the 107th floor  called   and the greatest bar on earth  these were tourist attractions in their own right  and a gathering spot for people who worked in the towers  this restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the united states  called  windows on the world wine school   run by wine personality   despite numerous assurances that these attractions would be rebuilt  the port authority scrapped plans to rebuild them  which has outraged some observers 
the fortified base of the tower has also been a source of controversy  some critics  including
of the   have said that it is alienating and dull  and reflects a sense of fear rather than freedom  leading them to dub the building  the fear tower   nicolai ouroussoff  the architecture critic for   calls the tower base a  grotesque attempt to disguise its underlying paranoia  
statue in front of the building
main article 
the america s response monument  a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue commemorating the actions of

owners and tenants
one world trade center is principally owned by the   around 5percent equity of the building was sold to the   a private real estate company  in exchange for an investment of at least  100million  the durst organization assisted in supervising the building s construction  and manages the building for the port authority  having responsibility for leasing  property management  and tenant installations  by september 2012  around 55percent of the building s floor space had been leased  but no new leases were signed for three years until may 2014  the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by november 2014 
in 2006  the state of new york agreed to a 15-year 415,000 square feet  38,600m2  lease  with an option to extend the lease s term and occupy up to 1,000,000 square feet  90,000m2   the

key figures
developer
of   the leaseholder and developer of the complex  retains control of the surrounding buildings  while the port authority has full control of the tower itself  silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the world trade center site in july 2001  and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site s redevelopment process 
before construction of the new tower began  silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower  the terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001  for which silverstein paid  14 million  gave silverstein  as leaseholder  the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed  after the september 11 attacks  there were a series of disputes between silverstein and insurance companies concerning the
that covered the original towers  this resulted in the construction of one world trade center being delayed  after a trial resulted  a verdict was given on april 29  2004  the verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the  one occurrence  interpretation  so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies  three insurers were added to the second trial group  at that time  the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer    but it did so several days later on may 3  2004  finding that this company was also subject to the  one occurrence  interpretation  silverstein appealed the swiss reinsurance decision  but the appeal failed on october 19  2006  the second trial resulted in a verdict on december 6  2004  the jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the  two occurrences  interpretation  referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the september 11 attacks  they were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies   2.2 billion   the highest potential payout was  4.577 billion  for buildings 1  2  4  and 5 
in march 2007  silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference  he highlighted what he describes as the failures of insurers
and
to pay  800 million in claims related to the attacks  insurers state that an agreement to split payments between silverstein and the port authority is a cause for concern 
key project coordinators
  one of silverstein s favorite architects  joined the project after silverstein urged him to do so  he developed a design proposal for one world trade center  initially collaborating with daniel libeskind  in may 2005  childs revised the design to address security concerns  he is the architect of the tower  and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development 
won the 2002 competition to develop a master plan for the world trade center s redevelopment 
architect
won the invitational competition to develop a plan for the new tower in 2002  he gave an initial proposal  which he called     for the design of one world trade center  his design included aerial gardens  windmills  and off-center spire  libeskind later denied a request to place the tower in a more rentable location next to the path station  he instead placed it another block west  as it would then line up with  and resemble  the   most of libeskind s original designs were later scrapped  and other architects were chosen to design the other wtc buildings  however  one element of libeskind s initial plan was included in the final design the tower s symbolic height of 1,776 feet  541m  
daniel r  tishman along with his father   builder of the original world trade center led the construction team from   the selected builder for one world trade center 
and jody durst  the co-presidents of the   a real estate development company  won the right to invest at least  100million in the project on july 7  2010 
in august 2010  cond nast  a long-time durst tenant  confirmed a tentative deal to move into 1 world trade center  and finalized the deal on may 26  2011  the contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization specifies that the durst organization will receive a  15 million fee  and a percentage of  base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project   the specifics of the signed contract give durst 75 percent of savings up to  24 million  stepping down to 50  25  and 15 percent as savings increase  since durst joined the project  significant changes have been made to the building  including the 185 foot base of the tower  the spire  and the plaza to the west of the building  facing the hudson river  the port authority has approved all the revisions 
port authority construction workers
a woodsearch films short-subject documentary entitled how does it feel to work on one world trade center  was uploaded to
on august 31  2010  it depicted construction workers who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site  however  further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of one world trade center  including 34 not reported to the   workers also left -related
at the site  which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience
