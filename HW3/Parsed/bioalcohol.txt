a dish of ethanol aflame
throughout history 
have been used as a   the first four
alcohols        and   are of interest as fuels because they can be synthesized chemically or biologically  and they have characteristics which allow them to be used in   the general chemical formula for alcohol fuel is cnh2n 1oh 
most methanol is produced from natural gas  although it can be produced from biomass using very similar chemical processes  ethanol is commonly produced from
through
processes  however  ethanol that is derived from petroleum should not be considered safe for consumption as the mixture contains about 5  methanol and may cause blindness or death 
has the advantage in combustion engines in that its
is closer to gasoline than the simpler alcohols  while still retaining over 25  higher octane rating   however  biobutanol is currently more difficult to produce than ethanol or methanol  when obtained from biological materials and or biological processes  they are known as bioalcohols  e g   bioethanol    there is no
difference between biologically produced and chemically produced alcohols 
one advantage shared by the four major alcohol fuels is their high   this tends to increase their fuel efficiency and largely offsets the lower energy density of vehicular alcohol fuels  as compared to petrol gasoline and diesel fuels   thus resulting in comparable  fuel economy  in terms of distance per volume metrics  such as kilometers per liter  or miles per gallon

methanol and ethanol  
ethanol used as a fuel 
main articles 
and
methanol and ethanol can both be derived from fossil fuels  biomass  or perhaps most simply  from carbon dioxide and water  ethanol has most commonly been produced through fermentation of sugars  and methanol has most commonly been produced from synthesis gas  but there are more modern ways to obtain these fuels  enzymes can be used instead of fermentation  methanol is the simpler molecule  and ethanol can be made from methanol  methanol can be produced industrially from nearly any biomass  including animal waste  or from carbon dioxide and water or steam by first converting the biomass to synthesis gas in a   it can also be produced in a laboratory using electrolysis or enzymes 
as a fuel  methanol and ethanol both have advantages and disadvantages over fuels such as
 gasoline  and   in spark ignition engines  both alcohols can run at a much higher
rates and with higher   both alcohols have a high   with ethanol at 109 ron     90 mon      which equates to 99.5   and methanol at 109 ron  89 mon  which equates to 99 aki   note that aki refers to    which averages the ron and mon ratings  ron mon  2  and is used on u s  gas station pumps  ordinary european petrol is typically 95 ron  85 mon  equal to 90 aki  as a compression ignition engine fuel  both alcohols create very little particulates  but their low cetane number means that an ignition improver like glycol must be mixed into the fuel with approx  5  
when used in spark ignition engines alcohols have the potential to reduce    
and particulates  a test with e85 fueled chevrolet luminas showed that
went down by 20-22   nox by 25-32  and co by 12-24  compared to reformulated gasoline  toxic emissions of benzene and 1,3 butadiene also decreased while aldehyde emissions increased   in particular  
tailpipe emissions of co2 also decrease due to the lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratio of these alcohols  and the improved engine efficiency 
methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and insoluble contaminants 
ions  which are soluble contaminants  such as chloride ions  have a large effect on the corrosivity of alcohol fuels  halide ions increase corrosion in two ways  they chemically attack passivating oxide films on several metals causing pitting corrosion  and they increase the conductivity of the fuel  increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical  galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system  soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide  itself a product of corrosion by halide ions  clogs the fuel system over time  to prevent corrosion the fuel system must be made of suitable materials  electrical wires must be properly insulated and the fuel level sensor must be of pulse and hold type  magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type  in addition  high quality alcohol should have a low concentration of contaminants and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added  scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol  the experiments are done with e50  which is more aggressive   speeds up the corrosion effect  it is very clear that by increasing the amount of water in fuel ethanol one can reduce the corrosion  at 2  or 20,000 ppm water in the fuel ethanol the corrosion stopped  the observations in japan are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol  the reaction mechanism is 3etoh   al -  al oet 3  3/2h2 will be the same at lower-mid blends  when enough water is present in the fuel  the aluminum will react preferably with water to produce al2o2  repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer  the aluminum alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer  water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer 
methanol and ethanol are also incompatible with some polymers  the alcohol reacts with the polymers causing swelling  and over time the oxygen breaks down the carbon-carbon bonds in the polymer causing a reduction in tensile strength  for the past few decades though  most cars have been designed to tolerate up to 10  ethanol  e10  without problem  this includes both fuel system compatibility and lambda compensation   of fuel delivery with fuel injection engines featuring closed loop lambda control  in some engines ethanol may degrade some compositions of plastic or rubber fuel delivery components designed for conventional petrol  and also be unable to lambda compensate the fuel properly   
 flexfuel  vehicles have upgraded fuel system and engine components which are designed for long life using e85 or m85  and the
can adapt to any fuel blend between gasoline and e85 or m85  typical upgrades include modifications to  fuel tanks  fuel tank electrical wiring  fuel pumps  fuel filters  fuel lines  filler tubes  fuel level sensors  fuel injectors  seals  fuel rails  fuel pressure regulators  valve seats and inlet valves   total flex  autos destined for the brazilian market can use e100  100  ethanol    
one liter of ethanol contain 21.1 mj  a liter of methanol 15.8 mj and a liter of gasoline approximately 32.6 mj  in other words  for the same energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline  one needs 1.6 liters gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters gallons of methanol  the raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however  because alcohol-fueled engines can be made substantially more energy-efficient  a larger percentage of the energy available in a liter of alcohol fuel can be converted to useful work  this difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference    depending on the particular engines being compared 
has been proposed as a future biofuel  often as an alternative to the   methanol has a long history as a racing fuel  early grand prix racing used blended mixtures as well as pure methanol  the use of the fuel was primarily used in north america after the war     however  methanol for racing purposes has largely been based on methanol produced from
derived from natural gas and therefore this methanol would not be considered a biofuel  methanol is a possible biofuel  however when the
is derived from   in theory  methanol can also be produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen using nuclear power or any renewable energy source  although this is not likely to be economically viable on an industrial scale  see    compared to bioethanol  the primary advantage of methanol biofuel is its much greater well-to-wheel efficiency  this is particularly relevant in temperate climates where fertilizers are needed to grow sugar or starch crops to make ethanol  whereas methanol can be produced from
 woody  biomass 
is already being used extensively as a   and the use of
alone or as part of a mix with gasoline is increasing  compared to methanol its primary advantage is that it is less corrosive and additionally the fuel is non-toxic  although the fuel will produce some toxic exhaust emissions  from 2007  the
will use ethanol as its exclusive fuel  after 40 years of using methanol  since september 2007 petrol stations in nsw  australia are mandated to supply all their petrol with 2  ethanol content
butanol and propanol  
main article 
and
are considerably less toxic and less volatile than methanol  in particular  butanol has a high
of 35c  which is a benefit for fire safety  but may be a difficulty for starting engines in cold weather  the concept of flash point is however not directly applicable to engines as the compression of the air in the cylinder means that the temperature is several hundred degrees celsius before ignition takes place 
the fermentation processes to produce propanol and butanol from
are fairly tricky to execute  and the weizmann organism    currently used to perform these conversions produces an extremely unpleasant smell  and this must be taken into consideration when designing and locating a fermentation plant  this organism also dies when the butanol content of whatever it is fermenting rises to 7   for comparison 
dies when the ethanol content of its feedstock hits 14   specialized strains can tolerate even greater ethanol concentrations - so-called turbo yeast can withstand up to 16  ethanol   however  if ordinary saccharomyces yeast can be modified to improve its ethanol resistance  scientists may yet one day produce a strain of the weizmann organism with a butanol resistance higher than the natural boundary of 7   this would be useful because butanol has a higher
than ethanol  and because waste fibre left over from sugar crops used to make ethanol could be made into butanol  raising the alcohol yield of fuel crops without there being a need for more crops to be planted 
despite these drawbacks 
and
have recently announced that they are jointly to build a small scale
demonstration plant
alongside the large bioethanol plant they are jointly developing with  
energy environment international developed a method for producing
from biomass  which involves the use of two separate micro-organisms in sequence to minimize production of acetone and ethanol byproducts 
the swiss company butalco gmbh uses a special technology to modify yeasts in order to produce butanol instead of ethanol  yeasts as production organisms for butanol have decisive advantages compared to bacteria 
butanol combustion is  c4h9oh   6o2  4co2   5h2o   heat
propanol combustion is  2c3h7oh   9o2  6 co2   8h2o   heat
the 3-carbon alcohol  propanol  c3h7oh   is not often used as a direct fuel source for petrol engines unlike ethanol  methanol and butanol   with most being directed into use as a solvent  however  it is used as a source of hydrogen in some types of fuel cell  it can generate a higher voltage than methanol  which is the fuel of choice for most alcohol-based fuel cells  however  since propanol is harder to produce than methanol  biologically or from oil   methanol-utilising fuel cells are preferred over those that utilise propanol 
by country  
brazil  
main article 
was until recently the largest producer of alcohol fuel in the world  typically fermenting ethanol from   the country produces a total of 18 billion litres  4.8 billion gallons  annually  of which 3.5 billion liters are exported  2 billion of them to the   alcohol cars debuted in the brazilian market in 1979 and became quite popular because of heavy subsidy  but in the 1980s prices rose and gasoline regained the leading market share 
however  from 2003 on  alcohol is rapidly rising its market share once again because of new technologies involving   called  flex  or  total flex  by all major car manufacturers        etc     flex  engines work with gasoline  alcohol or any mixture of both fuels  as of may 2009  more than 88  of new vehicles sold in brazil are flex fuel 
because of the brazilian leading production and technology  many countries became very interested in importing alcohol fuel and adopting the  flex  vehicle concept  on march 7 of 2007  us president
visited the city of
to sign agreements with brazilian president
on importing alcohol and its technology as an alternative fuel 
china  
main article 
as early as 1935  china has made alcohol fuel powered cars 
has reported with a 70

an independence from  
national committee of planning and action coordination for clean automobile had listed key technologies related to alcohol ether fuel and accelerated industrialization into its main agenda  alcohol fuels had become part of five main alternative fuels  two of which were alcohols 
and
united states  
see
the united states at the end of 2007 was producing 26.9 billion litres  7 billion gallons  per year e10 or gasohol is commonly marketed in delaware and e85 is found in many states  particularly in the midwest where ethanol from corn is produced locally 
many states and municipalities have mandated that all gasoline fuel be blended with 10 percent alcohol  usually ethanol  during some or all of the year  this is to reduce pollution and allows these areas to comply with federal pollution limits  because alcohol is partially oxygenated  it produces less overall pollution  including   in some areas  california in particular  the regulations may also require other formulations or added chemicals that reduce pollution  but add complexity to the fuel distribution and increase the cost of the fuel

main articles 
and
the first alcohol fuel in japan began with
in 1999  gaiax was developed in   and imported by japan  the principal ingredient was methanol 
because gaiax was not gasoline  it was a tax-free object of the   however  as a result  the use of gaiax came to be considered an act of smuggling in japan by the government and the petroleum industry  retailing of gaiax was done to avoid the tax evasion criticism by independently paying the
in the legal system regulations 
accidental vehicle fires where gaiax was being refueled began to be reported in around 2000 when the tax evasion discussion had almost ended  the car industry in japan criticized gaiax  saying that  fires broke out because high density alcohol had corroded the fuel pipes   gaiax was named a  high density alcohol fuel   and a campaign was executed to exclude it from the market long term  finally  the
also joined this campaign 
was revised under the pretext of safety concerns in 2003  this prohibited the manufacturing and sale of  high density alcohol fuel   and added a substantial gaiax sales ban  by revising the law  fuel manufacturers are prohibited from adding 3  or more alcohol to gasoline  this revision to the law is grounds not to be able to sell alcohol fuel greater than e3 in japan 
the petroleum industry in japan is now proceeding with research and development of an original alcohol fuel that differs from gaiax  however  the commercial manufacture and sale of any new fuel may be barred by existing laws that currently exclude gaiax from the market  moreover  the strong aversion by the japanese consumer to a high density alcohol fuel of any type may prevent commercial success of any new fuel
