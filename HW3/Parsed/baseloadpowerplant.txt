description  
a base load power station in  
baseload plant   also baseload power plant or base load power station  is an energy station devoted to the production of base load supply  baseload plants are the production facilities used to meet some or all of a given region s continuous energy demand  and produce energy at a constant rate  usually at a low cost relative to other production facilities available to the system  examples of baseload plants using nonrenewable fuels include
and
plants  baseload plants typically run at all times through the year except in the case of repairs or maintenance  these plants are often designed for relatively high efficiency  and may be
plants  but may take several days to start up and shut down 
each baseload power plant on a grid is allotted a specific amount of the baseload power demand to handle  the base load power is determined by the
of the system  for a typical power system  the rule of thumb is that the base load power is usually 35-40  of the maximum load during the year   
peaks or spikes in customer power demand are frequently handled by smaller and more responsive  but perhaps somewhat less efficient types of power plants called   often powered with    
while historically large power grids have had base load power plant to exclusively meet the base load  there is no specific technical requirement for this to be so  the base load can equally well be met by the appropriate quantity of

production is available with 95  or greater probability  and so may be used for baseload power 
hydroelectric power also has the desirable attribute of   but conversely a hydroelectric plant may run low on its  fuel   water at the reservoir elevation  if a long

economics  
power plants are designated baseload based on their low cost generation  efficiency and safety at rated output power levels  baseload power plants do not change production to match power consumption demands since it is more economical to operate them at constant production levels  use of higher cost combined-cycle plants or combustion turbines is thus minimized  and these plants can be cycled up and down to match more rapid fluctuations in consumption  baseload generators  such as nuclear and coal  often have very high   high
but very low   on the other hand  peak load generators  such as   have low fixed costs  low plant load factor and high marginal costs  typically baseload plants are large and provide a majority of the power used by a   thus  they are more effective when used continuously to cover the power baseload required by the grid 
base load power plant usage  
power plants may take many hours  if not days  to change their power output  although modern stations  and those in   can and do operate as
and alter their output to meet varying demands  because they require a long period of time to heat up to   these plants typically handle large amounts of baseload demand  different plants and technologies may have differing capacities to increase or decrease output on demand  nuclear plants are generally run at close to maximum output continuously  apart from maintenance 
and periodic refurbishment   while coal-fired plants may be cycled over the course of a day to meet demand    plants with multiple generating units may be used as a group to improve the  fit  with demand  by operating each unit as close to peak
as possible
