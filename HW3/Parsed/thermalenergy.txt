in visible light can be seen on this hot metalwork  thermal energy would ideally be the amount of heat required to warm the metal to its temperature  but this quantity is not well-defined  as there are many ways to obtain a given body at a given temperature  and each of them may require a different amount of total
input  thermal energy  unlike   is therefore not a state function 
in   thermal energy refers to the
present in a system due to its   the concept is not well-defined or broadly accepted in
or   because the internal energy can be changed without changing the temperature  and there is no way to distinguish which part of the internal energy is  thermal   instead  the appropriate thermodynamic concept is   defined as a transfer of energy  just as
is another type of transfer of energy   heat and work therefore depend on the path of transfer and are not state functions  whereas internal energy is a state function

relation to heat and internal energy  
is energy transferred spontaneously from a hotter to a colder system or body  heat is energy in transfer  not a property of the system  it is not contained within the boundary of the system  on the other hand  internal energy is a property of a system  and exists on both sides of a boundary  in an   the internal energy is the statistical mean of the kinetic energy of the gas particles  and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system boundary  the internal energy of an ideal gas can in this sense be regarded as  thermal energy   in this case  however  thermal energy and internal energy are identical 
systems that are more complex than ideal gases  such as real gases  can undergo   phase transitions can change the internal energy of the system without changing its temperature  therefore  the thermal energy cannot be defined solely by the temperature  thermal energy also cannot be defined by the difference between the internal energy and the net heat transfer in or out of the system  because it is easy to construct thermodynamic cycles where the system begins and ends in exactly the same state  but there is a net flow of heat in or out during the cycle 
for these reasons  the concept of the thermal energy of a system is ill-defined and is not used in thermodynamics 
historical context  
in an 1847 lecture entitled on matter  living force  and heat 
characterized various terms that are closely related to thermal energy and heat  he identified the terms
and
as forms of heat each effecting distinct physical phenomena  namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles  respectively  he describes latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles  i e  a form of   and the sensible heat as an energy affecting temperature measured by the thermometer due to the thermal energy  which he called the living force
