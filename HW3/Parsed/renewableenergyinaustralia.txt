australian renewable power plants
percentage of renewable electricity generation by energy source  2010 
renewable energy in australia deals with efforts being made in
to quantify and expand   which includes electricity  transport fuels and thermal energy  total renewable energy consumption in australia in 2015 was 346  representing 5.9  of australia s total energy consumption  this is an increase of 1.6  from 201112 levels  265pj   representing 4.3  of australia s total energy consumption  of all renewable energy consumption in 2015  in order of contribution 
 wood  woodwaste and bagasse  represents 53   hydroelectricity 19.2  
10.7  
5.1   biogas 4.7   solar hot water 3.8  and biofuels 3.6  
 the sum of all energy derived from plant matter  represented 61.3   211.9pj  of australia s total renewable energy consumption in 2015 
has undergone substantial growth in australia in the 21st century  it is estimated that australia produced 35,007 gigawatt hours  gwh  of renewable electricity  or equivalent  over the year ending december 2015  representing 14.6  of the total production in australia  by way of comparison  in 2006  approximately 9,500gwh of electricity came from renewable sources  representing less than 4  of nationally generated electricity   
of all renewable electrical sources in 2012  hydroelectricity represented 57.8   wind 26   bioenergy 8.1   solar pv 8   large-scale solar 0.147  
0.002  and marine 0.001   additionally  solar hot water heating was estimated to replace a further 2,422gwh of electrical generation 
similar to many other countries  development of renewable electricity in australia has been encouraged by
implemented in response to concerns about  
and economic stimulus  a key policy that has been in place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy development is a   which in 2010 was increased to 41,000gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations  this was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the
with the agreement of the labor opposition  alongside this there is the small-scale renewable energy scheme  an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water and several state schemes providing
to encourage   in 2012  these policies were supplemented by a
and a 10billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects  although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the federal government 
it has been suggested that with sufficient public and private sector investment and government policy certainty  australia could switch entirely to renewable energy within a decade by building additional large-scale solar and wind power developments  upgrading to transmission infrastructure and introduction of appropriate energy efficiency measures

renewable energy sources and initiatives  
australia has a very high potential for renewable energy  therefore  the
to a renewable energy system is gaining momentum in the peer-reviewed scientific literature  among them several studies have examined the feasibility of a transition to a 100  renewable electricity systems  which was found both practicable as well as economically and environmentally beneficial to combat  
hydro power  
the
constructed between 1949 and 1974 consists of sixteen major dams and seven major power stations  and has a total generating capacity of 3,800mw  the scheme generates on average 4,500 gwh electricity per year 
operates thirty power stations and fifty dams  and has a total generating capacity of 2,600mw  each year an average of 9,000 gwh of hydro-electricity is generated by the company 
in 200708 hydro-electricity represented 15  of renewable energy production in australia  in 2015 this had risen to 40  of renewable energy production 
wind power  
main article 
  atherton tablelands  queensland
as of october 2010  around 22.9  of australia s renewable electricity  and 2  of australia s total electricity  was sourced from wind power  enough electricity to power more than 700,000 homes  this came from 52 operating wind farms containing a total of 1,052turbines producing approximately 5,000gwh of electricity per year  this figure represented approximately a 30  increase in wind power generation each year over the previous decade  or a total increase of more than 1,000  over that time  the total installed capacity as of october 2010 was 1,880mw  including only projects over 100kw   with a further 1,043mw under construction 
is a fast-growing industry as south australia is well suited for wind farms  consequently  more wind power is generated in south australia than any other australian state or territory  as of october 2010 south australia had an installed capacity of 907mw from 435turbines accounting for close to 20  of that state s electricity needs  considerably ahead of victoria with 428mw from 267turbines  and western australia with 202mw from 142turbines  by the end of 2011 wind power in south australia had risen to 26  of the state s electricity generation  edging out coal fired power for the first time  with only 7.2  of australia s population south australia had 54  of the nation s installed wind power capacity  adelaide s  a2.2billion   capable of providing 50  of the city s water needs  is totally powered by renewable energy 
the
near   completed in 2009  was the largest wind farm in the southern hemisphere  consisting of 128turbines spread over 173km2 and rated at 192mw  however  in terms of generating capacity
near
was the largest with 239.5mw  despite only having 99turbines  these figures have since been surpassed by the
at   which opened in 2013 with a capacity of 420mw

solar photovoltaics  
solar photovoltaic  pv  technology generates electricity from sunlight  and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications  they first become mass-produced in 2000  when german environmentalists and
succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program 
the issue for the australian photovoltaics industry today is that there is enormous market potential  built up through a natural competitiveness in australian research and development  industry investment and government policy support  however  despite this  the industry is not yet self-sustaining and advantages gained to date could be lost  a 2004 market report suggested that a partnership between government and industry is necessary 
 the pv industry cannot continue to actively invest in strategic industry development unless the australian government is also committed to the journey  the industry     requires policy and program support to assist it in bridging the gap to mainstream commercial competitiveness  
two recent projects which illustrate co-operation between industry and government are the solar power station planned for north-western victoria  and the development of new solar cells  queensland solar and lighting is a major importer of chinese and european solar products for the brisbane region in queensland  australia 
mildura solar concentrator power station  
many projects have demonstrated the feasibility of
and a large new
is planned 
is to build the world s most advanced
 pv 
solar concentrator power station in north-western   the 154mw  a 420million project  will generate 270,000mwh per year  enough for more than 45,000 homes  it will aid in reducing salinity and create jobs during manufacture  construction and operation  it will also reduce
emissions by approximately 400,000tonnes per year  full commissioning is expected in 2013  with the first stage to be completed in 2010 
the essential components of the power plant  developed by solar systems over the past 16years  are 
 an ultra powerful solar module for use in concentrated sunlight  
 a cooling system to keep solar cells operating at 60c to optimise the operation of the pv modules in a concentrated solar beam that can melt steel  
 low cost  high performance mirror concentrator systems  
 a control system to manage the power station to deliver maximum reliability and output  
the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia  with support from the  
technology development  
sliver cell  tm  photovoltaic technology uses just one tenth of the costly and limited supply of silicon used in conventional solar panels while matching power  performance  and efficiency  professor   director of the
centre for sustainable energy systems  invented the technology with colleague dr klaus weber and developed it with funding from energy supplier
and the   blakers and weber won the   walsh medal for their work  origin energy is presently developing sliver modules for commercialisation at its a 20m pilot plant in regency park  south australia 
solar thermal energy  
main article 
australia has developed world leading solar thermal technologies  but with only very low levels of actual use  domestic solar water heating is the most common solar thermal technology 
solar water heating  
main article 
during the 1950s  australia s
 csiro  carried out world leading research into flat plate solar water heaters  a solar water heater manufacturing industry was subsequently established in australia and a large proportion of the manufactured product was exported  four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies  despite an excellent solar resource  the penetration of solar water heaters in the australian domestic market was only about 5  in 2006  with new dwellings accounting for most sales  by 2014  around 14  of australian households had solar hot water installed
it is estimated that by installing a solar hot water system  it could reduce a family s co2 emissions up to 3tonnes per year while saving up to 80  of the energy costs for water heating 
while solar water heating saves a significant amount of energy  they are generally omitted from measures of renewable energy production as they do not actually produce electricity  based on the installed base in australia as of october 2010  it was calculated that solar hot water units would account for about 7.4  of clean energy production if they were included in the overall figures 
solar thermal power  
  australia s first solar power station operated between 1981 and 2004
 s national solar energy centre in newcastle  nsw houses a 500kw  thermal  and a 1.5 mw  thermal  solar central receiver system  which are used as research and development facilities 
the
 anu  has worked on dish concentrator systems since the early 1970s and early work lead to the construction of the   in 1994  the first  big dish  400m2 solar concentrator was completed on the anu campus  in 2005 
was established to commercialise the big dish technology to deployment  wizard power has built and demonstrated the 500m2 commercial big dish design in canberra and the whyalla solaroasis will be the first commercial implementation of the technology  using 300 wizard power big dish solar thermal concentrators to deliver a 40mwe solar thermal power plant  construction is expected to commence in mid-late 2013 
research activities at the university of sydney and
have spun off into solar heat and power pty ltd  now    which is currently building a major project at
in the hunter valley  the csiro division of energy technology has opened a major solar energy centre in newcastle that has a tower system purchased from solar heat and power and a prototype trough concentrator array developed in collaboration with the anu 
  a town in north-west   has been chosen as the site for an innovative  31million  including a  7million government grant    the 10 mw
station would deliver about 30million kilowatt hours of electricity a year  enough to power the whole town 
will develop the project which should be running by early 2010 
in august 2008 worley parsons  an australian engineering firm  announced plans to build world s biggest solar plant in australia within three years  backed by nine australian companies  including miners bhp billiton and rio tinto  they have launched a study into finding possible sites to host the  1billion plant 
solar cities  
is a  75million program which is designed to demonstrate how    
and new approaches to
can combine to provide a sustainable energy future in urban locations throughout australia  it is a partnership approach that involves all levels of government  the private sector and the local community     
and
are the first four solar cities announced in australia  consumers will be able to purchase solar
panels using discounted loans  the project also plans to help low-income and rental households in the community share in the benefits of the project through other cost-saving initiatives 
geothermal energy  
main article 
in australia  geothermal energy is a natural resource which is not utilised as a form of energy  however  there are known and potential locations near the centre of the country in which geothermal activity is detectable  exploratory geothermal wells have been drilled to test for the presence of high temperature geothermal activity and such high levels were detected  as a result  projects will eventuate in the coming years and more exploration is expected at potential locations 
south australia has been described as  australia s hot rock haven  and this emissions free and renewable energy form could provide an estimated 6.8  of australia s base load power needs by 2030  according to an estimate by the centre for international economics  australia has enough geothermal energy to contribute electricity for 450years 
there are currently 19 companies australia-wide spending a 654million in exploration programmes in 141 areas  in south australia  which is expected to dominate the sector s growth  12 companies have already applied for 116 areas and can be expected to invest a 524million  us 435 m  in their projects by the next six years  ten projects are expected to achieve successful exploration and heat flows  by 2010  with at least three power generation demonstration projects coming on stream by 2012 
a geothermal power plant is generating 80kw of electricity at birdsville  in southwest queensland 
wave power  
main article 
several projects for harvesting the power of the ocean are under development 
pty ltd is developing a 19mw wave power station connected to the grid near   the project has received an au 66.46million grant from the  
is trialling a
system at  
is refining a method of using energy captured from passing waves 
to generate high-pressure sea water  this is piped onshore to drive a turbine and to create desalinated water  a series of large buoys is tethered to piston pumps anchored in waters 15 to 50 metres  49 to 164ft  deep  the rise and fall of passing waves drives the pumps  generating water pressures of up to 1,000pounds per square inch  psi   the company is looking to have a 50 mw demonstration project finished within the next four years 
biopower systems is developing its biowave system anchored to the seabed that would generate electricity through the movement of buoyant blades as waves pass  in a swaying motion similar to the way sea plants  such as kelp  move  it expects to complete pilot wave and tidal projects off northern
this year 
biofuels  
main article 
biofuels produced from food crops have become controversial as food prices increased significantly in mid-2008  leading to increased concerns about  
can be produced from
or grains and there are currently three commercial producers of fuel ethanol in australia  all on the east coast 
legislation imposes a 10  cap on the concentration of fuel ethanol blends  blends of 90  unleaded petrol and 10  fuel ethanol are commonly referred to as e10  which is mainly available through service stations operating under the bp  caltex  shell  and united brands 
in partnership with the   the canegrowers organisation launched a regional billboard campaign in march 2007 to promote the renewable fuels industry  over 100million litres of the new bp unleaded with renewable ethanol has now been sold to queensland motorists 
biodiesel produced from oilseed crops or recycled cooking oil may be a better prospect than ethanol  given the nation s   and the growing popularity of fuel-efficient diesel cars  australian cities are some of the most car-deponent cities in the world  and legislations involving vehicle pollution within the country are considered relatively lax 
biomass  
can be used directly for electricity generation  for example by burning sugar cane waste    as a fuel for thermal power generation in sugar mills  it can also be used to produce steam for industrial uses  cooking and heating  it can also be converted into a liquid or gaseous biofuel 
in 2015 bagasse accounted for 26.1   90.2pj  of australia s renewable energy consumption  while wood and woodwaste for another 26.9   92.9pj  
biomass for energy production was the subject of a federal government report in 2004 
major renewable energy companies  
bp solar  
has been involved in solar power since 1973 and its subsidiary    is now one of the world s largest solar power companies with production facilities in the united states  spain 
and australia  bp solar is involved in the commercialisation of a long life deep cycle
battery  jointly developed by the

which is expected to be fully commissioned late in 2008 
government policy  
this article needs to be updated  please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information   april 2009 
main articles 
and
there are a number of government policies in place in australia that influence the development of renewable energy 
mandatory renewable energy target  mret  schemes  
a key policy encouraging the development of renewable energy in australia includes
 mret  schemes at both commonwealth and state levels  in 2001  the
introduced an mret of 9,500 gwh of new renewable energy generation by 2010  this target has since been revised with the
introducing in january 2011 an expanded target of 45,000 gwh of additional renewable energy between 2001 and 2020  this mret has been split into a small scale renewable energy scheme  sres  and large scale renewable energy target  lret  components to ensure that adequate incentive exists for large scale grid connected renewable energy 
a number of states have also implemented their own renewable energy targets independent of the commonwealth  for example  the victorian renewable energy target scheme  vret  mandated an additional 5  of victoria s  load for renewable generation   although this has since been replaced by the new australian government lret and sres targets  south australia achieved its target of 20  of renewable supply by 2014 three years ahead of schedule  i e  in 2011  and has subsequently established a new target of 33  to be achieved by 2020 
renewable energy certificates registry  
the
 rec-registry  is an internet based registry system that is required by the australian renewable energy  electricity  act 2000  the act   the rec-registry is dedicated to  maintaining various registers  as set in the act   and facilitating the creation  registration  transfer and surrender of renewable energy certificates  recs  
carbon pricing  
main article 
in 2012  the gillard government implemented a
of  23 per tonne to be paid by 300 liable entities representing the highest business emitters in australia  the carbon price will increase to  25.40 per tonne by 201415  and then will be set by the market from 1 july 2015 onwards  it is expected that in addition to encouraging efficient use of electricity  pricing carbon will encourage investment in cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power  treasury modelling has projected that with a carbon price  energy from the renewables sector is likely to reach 40 percent of supply by 2050 
analysis of the first 6months of operation of the carbon tax have shown that there has been a drop in carbon emissions by the electricity sector  it has been observed that there has been a change in the mix of energy over this period  with less electricity being sourced from coal and more being produced by renewables such as hydro and wind power  the government at the time presented this analysis as an indicator that their policies to promote cleaner energy are working 
the carbon pricing legislation was repealed by the -led australian government on 17 july 2014  since then  carbon emissions from the electricity sector have increased 
clean energy finance corporation  
main article 
the australian government has announced the creation of the new 10billion dollar clean energy finance corporation which will commence business in july 2013  the goal of this intervention is to overcome barriers to the mobilisation of capital by the renewable energy sector  it will make available two billion dollars a year for five years for the financing of renewable energy  energy efficiency and low emissions technologies projects in the latter stages of development  the government has indicated that the fund is expected to be financially self-sufficient producing a positive return on investment comparable to the long term bond rate 
feed-in tariffs  
main article 
have been enacted on a state by state basis in australia to encourage investment in renewable energy by providing above commercial rates for electricity generated from sources such as rooftop photovoltaic panels or wind turbines  the schemes in place focus on residential scale infrastructure by having limits that effectively exclude larger scale developments such as wind farms  feed-in tariffs schemes in australia started at a premium  but have mechanisms by which the price paid for electricity decreases over time to be equivalent or below the commercial rate  all the schemes now in place in australia are  net  schemes whereby the householder is only paid for surplus electricity over and above what is actually used  in the past  new south wales and the australian capital territory enacted  gross  schemes whereby householders were entitled to be paid for 100  of renewable electricity generated on the premises  however these programs have now expired  in 2008 the
 coag  agreed to harmonise the various state schemes and developed a set of national principles to apply to new schemes  leader of the australian greens  christine milne  has advocated a uniform national  gross  feed-in tariff scheme  however this proposal has not been enacted 
subsidies to fossil fuel industry  
there is dispute about the level of subsidies paid to the fossil fuel industry in australia 
the
 acf  argues that according to the definitions of the
 oecd   fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in australia by means of direct payments  favourable tax treatment  and other actions  it is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources  analysis by the acf indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of a 7.7billion  with the most significant component being the fuel tax credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users 
this analysis is disputed by the
 ipa  who argue that the acf s definition of a subsidy differs from that of the oecd and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view  however  the ipa acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the acf analysis  some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence 
ratification of the kyoto protocol  
australia ratified the
in december 2007 under the then newly elected prime minister   evidence suggests australia will meet its targets required under this protocol  australia had not ratified the
until then  due to concerns over a loss of competitiveness with the us  which also rejects the treaty 
public opinion and action  
demonstration in front of the
supporting investment in renewable energy 
survey results suggest that there is considerable public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in australia  in one recent survey  74  of respondents favoured a  greenhouse strategy based mainly on energy efficiency and renewable energy  and 19  favoured an  approach that focuses mainly on nuclear power and clean coal technologies  
the australian results from the 1st annual world environment review  based on a survey of 1,007 people in 2007  found that 
88  of australians think that the government should do more to increase the use of solar power  78  say the government should do more to boost wind power  58  hydro power  50  tidal power  and 38  geothermal power  while only 25  think that the government should do more to increase use of nuclear power 
84  of australians think that the government should make it easier for people to buy renewable electricity 
89  think that all electricity should contain a minimum 25  of power generated from renewable energy sources  only 3  disagree 
82  think that the government should make it easier for people to buy solar panels 
80  think that the government should make it easier for people to buy energy efficient products  such as energy-saving light globes  water-saving shower heads and insulation etc 
85  think that the government should raise national fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks 
87  think that the government should do more to increase the number of cars that don t use petrol 
there is a considerable movement known as
to transition australia s entire energy system to renewable by 2020 
voluntary uptake of   a government program initiated in 1997 whereby people can pay extra for electricity that is generated from renewable sources  increased from 132,300 customers in 2005 to 904,716 customers in 2009 
future prospects  
the percentage of renewable resources that could be achieved by 2020 has evolved from 25  in 2007 to 100  in 2010 
2007
several reports have discussed the possibility of australia setting a renewable energy target of 25  by 2020  combined with some basic energy efficiency measures  such a target could deliver 15,000mw new renewable power capacity   33billion in new investment  16,600 new jobs  and 69million tonnes reduction in electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions 
2008
released a report in 2008 called  energy  r evolution  a sustainable energy australia outlook   detailing how australia could produce 40  of its energy through renewable energy by 2020 and completely phase out coal-fired power by 2030 without any job losses 
david spratt and phillip sutton argue in their book
that australia  as part of a concerted global effort  needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions down to zero as quickly as possible so that carbon dioxide can be drawn down from the atmosphere and greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced to less than 325ppm co2-e  which they argue is the upper  safe climate  level at which we can continue developing infinitely  they outline a plan of action which would accomplish this 
2010
australia could entirely transition to renewable energy within the 2010decade by building 12
 3500 mw each   which would provide 60  of electricity used  and 6500 7.5 mw   which would supply most of the remaining 40   along with other changes  according to the  zero carbon australia stationary energy plan   for a cost of a 370billion  about  8 household week over a decade to create an infrastructure that will last a minimum of 30 to 40years  biofuel use is proposed to increase from 2 pj used in 2010 to 51 pj year for modes of transportation not easily electrified  along with some hybrid vehicles  the cost of oil  post   is increasing  and without converting now to 100  renewable sources the world will pay an additional usd 8trillion over the next 25years  and then convert to 100  renewable 
recently an uptake of third party ownership models for small to mid-scale solar photovoltaic systems has been seen in australia mirroring developments in the same direction in the us with over 70  of all new pv systems installed under such models in california  colorado and arizona  in australia the solar
approach is pursued under the term solar sponsoring
2015
the australian federal government ordered the  10billion clean energy finance corporation to refrain from any new investment in wind power projects  with the explanation that the government prefers the corporation to invest in researching new technologies rather than the  mature  wind turbine sector
