base load and peaking power plants  
operate at maximum output  they shut down or reduce power only to perform maintenance or repair  base load power plants include     almost all      
and
plants 
operate only during times of peak demand  in countries with widespread   demand peaks around the middle of the afternoon  so a typical peaking power plant may start up a couple of hours before this point and shut down a couple of hours after  however  the duration of operation for peaking plants varies from a good portion of the waking day to only a couple dozen hours per year  peaking power plants include hydroelectric and
power plants  many gas turbine power plants can be fuelled with natural gas or   most plants burn natural gas  but a supply of diesel is sometimes kept on hand in case the gas supply is interrupted  other gas turbines can only burn either diesel or natural gas 
load following power plants  
load following power plants run during the day and early evening  they either shut down or greatly curtail output during the night and early morning  when the demand for electricity is the lowest  the exact hours of operation depend on numerous factors  one of the most important factors for a particular plant is how efficiently it can convert fuel into electricity  the most efficient plants  which are almost invariably the least costly to run per
produced  are brought online first  as demand increases  the next most efficient plants are brought on line and so on  the status of the
in that region  especially how much base load generating capacity it has  and the variation in demand are also very important  an additional factor for operational variability is that demand does not vary just between night and day  there are also significant variations in the time of year and day of the week  a region that has large variations in demand will require a large load following or peaking power plant capacity because base load power plants can only cover the capacity equal to that needed during times of lowest demand 
load following power plants can be hydroelectric power plants 
power plants  combined cycle gas turbine power plants and steam turbine power plants that run on natural gas or heavy   although heavy fuel oil plants make up a very small portion of the energy mix  a relatively efficient model of gas turbine that runs on natural gas can also make a decent load following plant 
gas turbine power plants  
gas turbine power plants are the most flexible in terms of adjusting power level  but are also among the most expensive to operate  therefore  they are generally used as  peaking  units at times of maximum power demand  gas turbines find only limited application as prime movers for power generation  one such use is power generation at remote military facilities  mine sites and rural or isolated communities  this is because gas turbine generators typically have significantly higher heat loss rates than steam turbine or diesel power plants  their higher fuel costs quickly outweigh their initial advantages in most applications  applications to be evaluated include 
supplying relatively large power requirements in a facility where space is at a significant premium  such as hardened structures 
mobile  temporary or difficult access site such as isolated communities  isolated mine sites  or troop support or line-of-sight stations 
peak shaving  in conjunction with a more-efficient generating station 
emergency power  where a gas turbines lightweight and relatively vibration-free operation are of greater importance than fuel consumption over short periods of operation  however  the starting time of gas turbines may not be suitable for a given application 
or
power plants where turbine exhaust waste heat can be economically used to generate additional power and thermal energy for process or space heating 
diesel and gas engine power plants  
diesel and gas engine power plants can be used for base load to stand-by power production due to their high overall flexibility  such power plants can be started rapidly to meet the grid demands  these engines can be operated efficiently on a wide variety of fuels  adding to their flexibility 
some applications are  base load power generation  wind-diesel  load following  cogeneration and trigeneration 
hydroelectric power plants  
power plants can operate as base load  load following or peaking power plants  they have the ability to start within minutes  and in some cases seconds  how the plant operates depends heavily on its water supply as many plants do not have enough water to operate anywhere near their full capacity on a continuous basis 
lakes and man made reservoirs used for hydropower come in all sizes  holding enough water for as little as a one day supply  or as much as a whole year s supply  a plant with a reservoir that holds less than the annual river flow may change it s operating style depending on the season of the year  for example  the plant may operate as a peaking plant during the dry season  as a base load plant during the wet season and as a load following plant between seasons  a plant with a large reservoir may operate independently of wet and dry seasons  such as operating at maximum capacity during peak heating or cooling seasons 
when electrical generation supplying the grid and the consumption or load on the electrical grid are in balance  the frequency of the alternating current is at it s normal rate  either 50 or 60 cycles per second   hydro electric power plants can be utilized for making extra revenue in an electric grid with erratic grid frequency  when grid frequency is above normal  ex  indian grid frequency is exceeding the rated 50hz for most of the duration in a month day   the extra power available can be consumed by adding extra load  say agriculture water pumps  to the grid and this new energy draw is available at nominal price or no price  however  there may not be a guarantee of continued supply at that price when the grid frequency falls below normal  which would then call for a higher price 
to arrest the fall of frequency below normal  the available hydro power plants are kept in no load nominal load operation and the load is automatically ramped up or down strictly following the grid frequency  i e  the hydro units would run at no load condition when frequency is above 50hz and generate power up to full load in case the grid frequency is below 50hz   thus a utility can draw two or more times energy from the grid by loading the hydro units less than 50  of the duration and the effective use of available water is enhanced more than twice the conventional peak load operation 
coal based power plants  
large size coal fired thermal power plants can also be used as load following   variable load power stations  these power plants are generally incorporated with following features to achieve this flexibility techno economically 
sliding pressure operation  sliding pressure operation of the steam generator allows the power plant to generate electricity without much deterioration in fuel efficiency at part load operation up to 75  of the  
over loading capability  the power plants are generally designed to run at 5 to 7  above the name plate rating for 5  duration in a year
frequency follow governor controls  the load generation can be automatically varied to suit the grid frequency needs 
two shift daily operation for five days in a week  the needed warm and hot start up of these power stations are designed to take lesser time to achieve full load operation  thus these power plants are not strictly base load power generation units 
hp lp steam bypass systems  this feature allows the steam
to reduce the load quickly and allows the
to adjust to the load requirement with a lag 
nuclear power plants  
load following is the potential for a power plant to adjust its power output as demand and price for electricity fluctuates throughout the day  in nuclear power plants  this is done by inserting control rods into the reactor pressure vessel  this operation is very inefficient as nuclear power generation is composed almost entirely of fixed and sunk costs  therefore  lowering the power output doesn t significantly reduce generating costs and the plant is thermo-mechanical stressed  older nuclear  and coal  power plants may take many hours  if not days  to achieve a steady state power output    in general it is not economical for large thermal installations such as nuclear power plants to practice load following   
modern nuclear plants with light water reactors are designed to have strong manoeuvring capabilities  nuclear power plants in france and in germany operate in load-following mode and so participate in the primary and secondary frequency control  some units follow a variable load programme with one or two large power changes per day  some designs allow for rapid changes of power level around rated power  a capability that is usable for frequency regulation  a more efficient solution is to maintain the primary circuit at full power and to use the excess power for cogeneration 
boiling water reactors  
 bwr  and
can use a combination of
and the speed of recirculation water flow to quickly reduce their power level down to under 60  of rated power  making them useful for overnight load-following  in markets such as
where half of the local utility s fleet is bwrs  it is common to load-follow  although less economic to do so  
pressurized water reactors  
 pwr  use a chemical shim in the moderator coolant  see   to control power level  and so normally do not load follow   in most pwrs  control rods are either fully withdrawn or fully inserted - variable control is difficult  partly due to the large bundle sizes  
in france  however  nuclear power plants use load following  french pwrs use  grey  control rods made of boron steel  in order to replace chemical shim  without introducing a large perturbation of the power distribution  these plants have the capability to make power changes between 30  and 100  of rated power  with a slope of 5  of rated power per minute  their licensing permits them to respond very quickly to the grid requirements 
solar and wind power plants  
for countries that are trending
baseload plants and towards
such as wind and solar  there is a corresponding increase in the need for peaking or load following power plants and the use of a grid intertie 
the infirm or unreliable secondary power from the renewable energy such as solar and wind power plants can be used to follow the load or stabilise the grid frequency with the help of
storage units economically  when the grid frequency is below the desired or rated value  the power being generated  if any  and the stored battery power is fed to the grid to raise the grid frequency  when the grid frequency is above the desired or rated value  the power being generated is fed or surplus grid power is drawn  in case cheaply available  to the battery units for energy storage  the grid frequency keeps on fluctuating 50 to 100 times in a day above and below the rated value depending on the type of load encountered and the type of generating plants in the electrical grid  recently  the cost of battery units  solar power plants  etc  have come down drastically to utilise secondary power for power grid stabilisation as an on line
