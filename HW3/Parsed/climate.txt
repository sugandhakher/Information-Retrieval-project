climate
climate is the statistics of   usually over a 30-year interval  it is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in           atmospheric particle count and other
variables in a given region over long periods of time  climate differs from weather  in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region 
a region s climate is generated by the climate system  which has five components          and  
the climate of a location is affected by its     and   as well as nearby
and their currents  climates can be
according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables  most commonly temperature and precipitation  the most commonly used classification scheme was
originally developed by   the thornthwaite system  in use since 1948  incorporates
along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and the potential effects on it of climate changes  the bergeron and
focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region 
is the study of ancient climates  since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century  paleoclimates are inferred from
that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in
and   and biotic evidence such as
and coral 
are mathematical models of past  present and future climates 
may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors  recent warming is discussed in

definition  
climate  from
klima  meaning inclination  is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period  the standard averaging period is 30years  but other periods may be used depending on the purpose  climate also includes statistics other than the average  such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations  the
 ipcc 
glossary definition is as follows 
climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the  average weather   or more rigorously  as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years  the classical period is 30years  as defined by the world meteorological organization  wmo   these quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature  precipitation  and wind  climate in a wider sense is the state  including a statistical description  of the climate system 
the
 wmo  describes climate  normals  as  reference points used by climatologists to compare current climatological trends to that of the past or what is considered  normal   a normal is defined as the arithmetic average of a climate element  e g  temperature  over a 30-year period  a 30 year period is used  as it is long enough to filter out any interannual variation or anomalies  but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends   the wmo originated from the
which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929  at its 1934
meeting the technical commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals  in 1982 the wmo agreed to update climate normals  and in these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data from 1 january 1961 to 31 december 1990 
the difference between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase  climate is what you expect  weather is what you get   over
time spans there are a number of nearly constant variables that determine climate  including   altitude  proportion of land to water  and proximity to oceans and mountains  these change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as   other climate determinants are more dynamic  the
of the ocean leads to a 5c  9f  warming of the northern
compared to other ocean basins  other
redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale  the density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption  water retention  and rainfall on a regional level  alterations in the quantity of atmospheric
determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet  leading to
or   the variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex  but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood  at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate change are concerned 
climate classification  
worldwide climate classifications
there are several ways to
into similar regimes  originally 
were defined in
to describe the weather depending upon a location s latitude  modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods  which focus on the causes of climate  and empiric methods  which focus on the effects of climate  examples of genetic classification include methods based on the
of different
types or locations within
weather disturbances  examples of
classifications include
defined by   evapotranspiration  or more generally the
which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain   a common shortcoming of these
is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define  rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature 
bergeron and spatial synoptic  
main article 
the simplest classification is that involving air masses  the bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification    air mass classification involves three letters  the first letter describes its
properties  with c used for continental air masses  dry  and m for maritime air masses  moist   the second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region  t for   p for   a for
or antarctic  m for   e for   and s for superior air  dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere   the third letter is used to designate the stability of the atmosphere  if the air mass is colder than the ground below it  it is labeled k  if the air mass is warmer than the ground below it  it is labeled w  while air mass identification was originally used in
during the 1950s  climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973 
based upon the bergeron classification scheme is the
 ssc   there are six categories within the ssc scheme  dry polar  similar to continental polar   dry moderate  similar to maritime superior   dry tropical  similar to continental tropical   moist polar  similar to maritime polar   moist moderate  a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical   and moist tropical  similar to maritime tropical  maritime monsoon  or maritime equatorial

main article 
the kppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation  the most commonly used form of the kppen classification has five primary types labeled a through e  these primary types are a  tropical  b  dry  c  mild mid-latitude  d  cold mid-latitude  and e  polar  the five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as                       and  
rain forests are characterized by high   with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 millimetres  69in  and 2,000 millimetres  79in   mean monthly temperatures exceed 18c  64f  during all months of the year

a subarctic climate has little precipitation  and monthly temperatures which are above 10c  50f  for one to three months of the year  with
in large parts of the area due to the cold winters  winters within subarctic climates usually include up to six months of temperatures averaging below 0c  32f

precipitation by month
devised by the american climatologist and geographer   this climate classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration  it monitors the portion of total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area  it uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area s moisture regime based upon its average temperature  average rainfall  and average vegetation type  the lower the value of the index in any given area  the drier the area is 
the moisture classification includes climatic classes with descriptors such as hyperhumid  humid  subhumid  subarid 
 values of 20 to 40   and arid  values below 40   humid regions experience more precipitation than evaporation each year  while arid regions experience greater evaporation than precipitation on an annual basis  a total of 33percent of the earth s landmass is considered either arid or semi-arid  including southwest north america  southwest south america  most of northern and a small part of southern africa  southwest and portions of eastern asia  as well as much of australia  studies suggest that precipitation effectiveness  pe  within the thornthwaite moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter  this index can be effectively used to determine the number of
and
species numbers within a given area  the index is also used in studies of climate change 
thermal classifications within the thornthwaite scheme include microthermal  mesothermal  and megathermal regimes  a microthermal climate is one of low annual mean temperatures  generally between 0c  32f  and 14c  57f  which experiences short summers and has a potential evaporation between 14 centimetres  5.5in  and 43 centimetres  17in   a mesothermal climate lacks persistent heat or persistent cold  with potential evaporation between 57 centimetres  22in  and 114 centimetres  45in   a megathermal climate is one with persistent high temperatures and abundant rainfall  with potential annual evaporation in excess of 114 centimetres  45in

details of the modern climate record are known through the taking of measurements from such weather instruments as     and
during the past few centuries  the instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale  their known error  their immediate environment  and their exposure have changed over the years  which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past 
paleoclimatology  
main article 
paleoclimatology is the study of past climate over a great period of the  s history  it uses evidence from ice sheets  tree rings  sediments  coral  and rocks to determine the past state of the climate  it demonstrates periods of stability and periods of change and can indicate whether changes follow patterns such as regular cycles

climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time  it reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years  these changes can be caused by processes internal to the earth  external forces  e g  variations in sunlight intensity  or  more recently  human activities

in recent usage  especially in the context of   the term  climate change  often refers only to changes in modern climate  including the rise in average surface
known as   in some cases  the term is also used with a presumption of human causation  as in the
 unfccc   the unfccc uses  climate variability  for non-human caused variations 
earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past  including four major   these consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal  separated by
periods  the accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface   reflecting more of the sun s energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature  increases in   such as by volcanic activity  can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period  suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the   variations in the earth s orbit  changes in the solar output  and volcanism 
climate models  
see also 
and
climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the     land surface and ice  they are used for a variety of purposes  from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system  to projections of future climate  all climate models balance  or very nearly balance  incoming energy as short wave  including visible  electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave  infrared  electromagnetic radiation from the earth  any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth 
the most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  primarily
 see    these models predict an upward trend in the   with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere 
models can range from relatively simple to quite complex 
simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
this can be expanded vertically  radiative-convective models   or horizontally
finally   coupled  atmosphereocean
discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange 
climate forecasting is a way by some scientists are using to predict climate change  in 1997 the prediction division of the international research institute for climate and society at columbia university began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis  to produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed  including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model s accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability
