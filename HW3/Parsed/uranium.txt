characteristics
a neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235
when   uranium is a silvery white  weakly radioactive   it has a
of 6  sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of    
and   it is     slightly   strongly
and a poor   uranium metal has a very high
of 19.1g cm3  denser than
 11.3g cm3   but slightly less dense than
and
 19.3g cm3  
uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements  with an exception of the   and their   with reactivity increasing with temperature 
and
dissolve uranium  but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly  when finely divided  it can react with cold water  in air  uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of   uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into
or other chemical forms usable in industry 
uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be   other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable  but not fissile  on bombardment with slow neutrons  its uranium-235
will most of the time divide into two smaller   releasing nuclear
and more neutrons  if too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei  a
occurs that results in a burst of heat or  in special circumstances  an explosion  in a nuclear reactor  such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a   absorbing some of the free neutrons  such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor
 see

as little as 15lb  7kg  of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb  the first nuclear bomb used in war    relied on uranium fission  but the very first nuclear explosive  the gadget used at   and the bomb that destroyed nagasaki    were both plutonium bombs

applications
military
various militaries use
as high-density penetrators 
the major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density penetrators  this ammunition consists of
 du  alloyed with 12  other elements  such as
or   at high impact speed  the density  hardness  and
of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets  tank armor and other removable
can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates  the use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the us  uk and other countries during wars in the persian gulf and the balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil  see   
depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials  while the metal itself is radioactive  its high density makes it more effective than
in halting radiation from strong sources such as   other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces  as ballast for missile
and as a shielding material  due to its high density  this material is found in
and in
  depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost  the main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by
rather than radioactivity  uranium being only a weak   
during the later stages of   the entire   and to a lesser extent afterwards  uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons  initially  two major types of fission bombs were built  a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses
derived from uranium-238  later  a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission fusion bomb    was built  that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of
and
to undergo   such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile  unenriched  uranium case  and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by
from the nuclear fusion process 
civilian
the most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in
the main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel   one kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about
of energy  21013   assuming complete fission  as much
as 1500
of  
commercial
plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3  uranium-235  the
and
designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel  fuel used for
reactors is typically highly enriched in
 the exact values are    in a   uranium-238 can also be converted into
through the following reaction

uranium glass glowing under
before  and  occasionally  after  the discovery of radioactivity  uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes  such as
and in  
the discovery and isolation of
in uranium ore  pitchblende  by
sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium  which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials  this left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product  since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one
of radium  this waste product was diverted to the glazing industry  making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant  besides the pottery glazes 
glazes accounted for the bulk of the use  including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green  yellow  mauve  black  blue  red and other colors 
uranium glass used as lead-in seals in a vacuum
uranium was also used in
chemicals  especially
as a    in lamp filaments for
bulbs  to improve the appearance of   and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes  uranium salts are
of silk or wool  uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron-dense  stains  in   to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in
of   isolated
and  
the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element  the long
of the isotope uranium-238  4.51109 years  makes it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest
and for other types of   including  
and   uranium metal is used for
targets in the making of high-energy x-rays 
history
pre-discovery use
the planet   which uranium is named after
the use of uranium in its natural
form dates back to at least the year 79   when it was used to add a yellow color to
glazes  yellow glass with 1  uranium oxide was found in a
villa on cape
in the   italy  by r  t  gunther of the
in 1912  starting in the late   pitchblende was extracted from the
silver mines in  
 now jchymov in the czech republic   and was used as a coloring agent in the local
industry  in the early 19th century  the world s only known sources of uranium ore were these mines 
discovery
discovered the phenomenon of
by exposing a
to uranium in 1896
the
of the element is credited to the german chemist   while he was working in his experimental laboratory in
in 1789  klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound  likely   by dissolving
in
and neutralizing the solution with   klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with
to obtain a black powder  which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself  in fact  that powder was an oxide of uranium   he named the newly discovered element after the planet    named after the primordial    which had been discovered eight years earlier by  
in 1841    professor of analytical chemistry at the
 central school of arts and manufactures  in   isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating
with  
discovered
by using uranium in 1896  becquerel made the discovery in paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt  k2uo2 so4 2  potassium uranyl sulfate   on top of an unexposed
in a drawer and noting that the plate had become  fogged   he determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate 
fission research
cubes and cuboids of uranium produced during the manhattan project
a team led by
in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of
  or
from the elements produced  see    the fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94  which the dean of the faculty of rome  orso mario corbino  christened
and   respectively  the experiments leading to the discovery of uranium s ability to fission  break apart  into lighter elements and release
were conducted by
and
in hahn s laboratory in berlin 
and her nephew  the physicist   published the physical explanation in february 1939 and named the process     soon after  fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction  confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939  and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235  further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be
into plutonium  which  like uranium-235  is also fissile by thermal neutrons  these discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and  
on 2 december 1942  as part of the   another team led by enrico fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained     working in a lab below the stands of
at the   the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons  360metric tons  of   58short tons  53metric tons  of   and six short tons  5.5 metric tons  of uranium metal  a majority of which was supplied by
in a makeshift production process 
nuclear weaponry
the
over
after the dropping of the uranium-based atomic bomb nicknamed   
two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the united states during   a uranium-based device  codenamed     whose fissile material was highly   and a plutonium-based device  see
and     whose plutonium was derived from uranium-238  the uranium-based little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the
city of
on 6 august 1945  exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500tonnes of   the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people  see    initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare  and that
could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks  but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world

discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the
mine in     collectively known as the   the ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old  then  uranium-235 constituted about 3  of the total uranium on earth  this is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur  provided other supporting conditions exist  the capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the

and   uo2 
2 also forms
with various
agents  the most commonly encountered of which is  
unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and
uranium-oxide cationic forms  the   salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion  are generally not water-soluble 
carbonates
the interactions of carbonate anions with uranium vi  cause the
to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution  while the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water  students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water   uranium carbonates are often soluble in water  this is because a u vi  cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes

relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in an aqueous carbonate solution 
effects of ph
the uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further  when the ph of a uranium vi  solution increases  the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high phs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex 
when carbonate is added  uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the ph is increased  one effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the ph range 6 to 8  a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels 
hydrides  carbides and nitrides
uranium metal heated to 250 to 300c  482 to 572f  reacts with
to form   even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen  this property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium     and
compounds  two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist  an  form that is obtained at low temperatures and a  form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250c 
and
are both relatively
compounds that are minimally soluble in   react with water  and can ignite in

main article 
consists of three major  
 99.28     uranium-235  0.71    and
 0.0054    all three are   emitting   with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing   rather than   there are also five other trace isotopes  uranium-239  which is formed when 238u undergoes spontaneous fission  releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238u atom  uranium-237  which is formed when 238u captures a neutron but emits two more  which then decays to   and finally  uranium-233  which is formed in the
of that neptunium-237  it is also expected that
should be able to undergo   which would produce uranium-232  but this has not yet been observed experimentally 
uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium  with a
of about 4.468109 years  roughly the   uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13108 years  and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48105 years  for natural uranium  about 49  of its alpha rays are emitted by each of 238u atom  and also 49  by 234u  since the latter is formed from the former  and about 2.0  of them by the 235u  when the earth was young  probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235  but the percentage of 234u was probably much lower than this 
uranium-238 is usually an  emitter  occasionally  it undergoes spontaneous fission   decaying through the   which has 18 members  into   by a variety of different decay paths 
the   which is called the   has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207  the constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in  
uranium-234  which is a member of the   decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes 
uranium-233 is made from
by neutron bombardment  usually in a nuclear reactor  and 233u is also fissile  its decay series ends at
and -205 
uranium-235 is important for both
and   because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on earth in any significant amount that is   this means that it can be split into two or three fragments    by thermal neutrons 
uranium-238 is not fissile  but is a fertile isotope  because after
it can produce   another fissile isotope  indeed  the 238u nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope   239u decays by
to -239  also a beta-emitter  that decays in its turn  within a few days into plutonium-239  239pu was used as fissile material in the first
detonated in the    on 15 july 1945 in  
enrichment
main article 
cascades of
are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes
in nature  uranium is found as uranium-238  99.2742   and uranium-235  0.7204   
concentrates  enriches  the fissionable uranium-235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants  except for
and   most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the   the concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve this is called a    
to be considered  enriched   the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3  and 5   this process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238  called depleted uranium or  du   to be considered  depleted   the uranium-235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0.3   the price of uranium has risen since 2001  so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35  uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment  driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above  130 per kilogram in july 2007 from  5 in 2001 
the
process  where gaseous
 uf
6  is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235uf6 and 238uf6 using high-speed   is the cheapest and leading enrichment process  the
process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the   in this process  uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly
through a - membrane  and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate  since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235   the
method employs a
beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine  this leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution  an alternative laser method of enrichment is known as
 avlis  and employs visible
such as   another method used is liquid thermal diffusion 
human exposure
a person can be exposed to uranium  or its radioactive daughters  such as   by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food  the amount of uranium in air is usually very small  however  people who work in factories that process
  live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons  live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium
have been used  or live or work near a -fired power plant  facilities that mine or process uranium ore  or enrich uranium for reactor fuel  may have increased exposure to uranium  houses or structures that are over uranium deposits  either natural or man-made slag deposits  may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas  the
 osha  has set the
for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg m3 over an 8-hour workday  the
 niosh  has set a
 rel  of 0.2mg m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg m3  at levels of 10mg m3  uranium is  
most ingested uranium is excreted during   only 0.5  is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium  such as its oxide  are ingested  whereas absorption of the more soluble
ion can be up to 5   however  soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body  whereas insoluble uranium compounds  especially when inhaled by way of dust into the   pose a more serious exposure hazard  after entering the bloodstream  the absorbed uranium tends to
and stay for many years in
tissue because of uranium s affinity for phosphates  uranium is not absorbed through the skin  and
released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin 
incorporated uranium becomes
ions  which accumulate in bone  liver  kidney  and reproductive tissues  uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and  
effects and precautions
normal functioning of the         and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure  because  besides being weakly radioactive  uranium is a   uranium is also a reproductive toxicant  radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation  the primary form of 238u decay  has a very short range  and will not penetrate skin 
 uo2 
2  ions  such as from
or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds  have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals  while the cdc has published one study that no human
has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium  exposure to uranium and its decay products  especially   are widely known and significant health threats  exposure to     and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure  but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons  although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of
has resulted in human fatalities  those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and
rather than with uranium itself  finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is   small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature 
uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution  uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it
