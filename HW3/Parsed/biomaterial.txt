a biomaterial is any substance that has been engineered to interact with biological systems for a medical purpose - either a therapeutic  treat  augment  repair or replace a tissue function of the body  or a diagnostic one  as a science  biomaterials is about fifty years old  the study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering  it has experienced steady and strong growth over its history  with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products  biomaterials science encompasses elements of      
and  
note that a biomaterial is different from a biological material  such as   that is produced by a   additionally  care should be exercised in defining a biomaterial as   since it is application-specific  a biomaterial that is biocompatible or suitable for one application may not be biocompatible in another

introduction  
biomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in the laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches utilizing metallic components   
or   they are often used and or adapted for a medical application  and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs  augments  or replaces a natural function  such functions may be benign  like being used for a   or may be
with a more interactive functionality such as
coated   biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications  surgery  and drug delivery  for example  a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body  which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time  a biomaterial may also be an

biomineralization  
main article 
biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce   often to harden or stiffen existing tissues  such tissues are called   it is an extremely widespread phenomenon  all six taxonomic kingdoms contain members that are able to form minerals  and over 60 different minerals have been identified in organisms  examples include
in
and  
in   and
and
in   these minerals often form structural features such as sea
and the
in
and  
have been producing mineralised
for the past 550 million years  other examples include  
and
deposits involving bacteria  biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic sensors in
 fe3o4   gravity sensing devices  caco3  caso4  baso4  and iron storage and mobilization  fe2o3h2o in the protein   
self-assembly  
is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles  atoms  molecules      etc   without the influence of any external forces  large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into
stable  structurally well-defined arrays  quite reminiscent of one of the 7 crystal systems found in
and
 e g  face-centered cubic  body-centered cubic  etc    the fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the
 or lattice parameter  in each particular case 
molecular self-assembly is found widely in biological systems and provides the basis of a wide variety of complex biological structures  this includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructural features and designs found in nature  thus  self-assembly is also emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and   molecular crystals  liquid crystals  colloids  micelles    phase-separated polymers  thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques  the distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization 
structural hierarchy  
nearly all materials could be seen as hierarchically structured  especially since the changes in spatial scale bring about different mechanisms of deformation and damage  however  in biological materials this hierarchical organization is inherent to the microstructure  one of the first examples of this  in the history of structural biology  is the early
work on the hierarchical structure of
and
by astbury and woods  in bone  for example 
is the building block of the
 a triple helix with diameter of 1.5nm  these
molecules are
with the mineral phase    a calcium phosphate  forming
that curl into
of alternating directions  these    are the basic building blocks of bones  with the volume fraction distribution between organic and mineral phase being about 60/40 
in another level of complexity  the hydroxyapatite crystals are mineral platelets that have a diameter of approximately 70100nm and thickness of 1nm  they originally nucleate at the gaps between collagen fibrils 
similarly  the hierarchy of
shell begins at the nanolevel  with an organic layer having a thickness of 2030nm  this layer proceeds with single crystals of
 a polymorph of caco3  consisting of  bricks  with dimensions of 0.5 and finishing with layers approximately 0.3mm    
are arthropods whose carapace is made of a mineralized hard component  which exhibits brittle fracture  and a softer organic component composed primarily of   the brittle component is arranged in a helical pattern  each of these mineral rods  1 m diameter  contains chitinprotein fibrils with approximately 60nm diameter  these fibrils are made of 3nm diameter canals which link the interior and exterior of the shell 
applications  
biomaterials are used in 
bone plates
artificial ligaments and tendons
for tooth fixation
blood vessel prostheses
skin repair devices  artificial tissue 
cochlear replacements
drug delivery mechanisms
sustainable materials
vascular grafts
nerve conduits
  clips  and staples for
pins and screws for fracture stabilisation
biomaterials must be compatible with the body  and there are often issues of
which must be resolved before a product can be placed on the market and used in a
setting  because of this  biomaterials are usually subjected to the same requirements as those undergone by new
therapies 
all manufacturing companies are also required to ensure traceability of all of their products so that if a defective product is discovered  others in the same batch may be traced 
heart valves  
in the united states  45  of the 250,000 valve replacement procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant  the most widely used valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve  or st  jude valve  the mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth  with both allowing the flow of blood as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow  the valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon  and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called dacrontm  du pont s trade name for    the mesh allows for the body s tissue to grow while incorporating the valve 
skin repair  
main article 
most of the time  artificial tissue is grown from the patients own cells  however  when the damage is so extreme that it is impossible to use the patient s own cells  artificial tissue cells are grown  the difficulty is in finding a scaffold that the cells can grow and organize on  the characteristics of the scaffold must be that it is biocompatible  cells can adhere to the scaffold  mechanically strong and   one successful scaffold is a
of
and  
compatibility  
is related to the behavior of
in various environments under various chemical and physical conditions  the term may refer to specific properties of a material without specifying where or how the material is to be used  for example  a material may elicit little or no
in a given organism  and may or may not able to integrate with a particular cell type or   the ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into how biomaterials interact with the
and eventually how those interactions determine the clinical success of a
 such as
or    modern medical devices and
are often made of more than one materialso it might not always be sufficient to talk about the biocompatibility of a specific material 
biopolymers  
main article 
biopolymers are
produced by living organisms 
and  
and   and
and
are all examples of biopolymers  in which the
units  respectively  are     and   cellulose is both the most common biopolymer and the most common organic compound on earth  about 33  of all plant matter is cellulose

footnotes  
the notion of exploitation includes utility for applications and for fundamental research to understand reciprocal perturbations as well 
the definition non-viable material used in a medical device  intended to interact with biological systems recommended in ref  cannot be extended to the environmental field where people mean material of natural origin 
this general term should not be confused with the terms biopolymer or biomacromolecule  the use of polymeric biomaterial is recommended when one deals with
or polymer device of therapeutic or biological interest
