science in a broad sense existed before the

and successful in its   so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term 
science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge  in particular  it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share  for example  knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought  this is shown by the construction of complex calendars  techniques for making poisonous plants edible  and buildings such as   however  no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things  which are true in every community  and other types of communal knowledge  such as mythologies and legal systems

a major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by
to apply philosophy to the study of human things  including human nature  the nature of political communities  and human knowledge itself  he criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative  and lacking in self-criticism  he was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order  explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter  the study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition  however  so socrates was executed as a heretic   30e
later created a less controversial systematic programme of socratic philosophy which was
and human-centred  he rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists  for example  in his physics the sun goes around the earth  and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans  each thing has a
and
and a role in the rational cosmic order  motion and change is described as the
of potentials already in things  according to what types of things they are  while the socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being  a study aristotle divided into
and    they did not argue for any other types of  
aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans  treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity  practical thinking about good living as something less lofty  and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes  in contrast to modern science  aristotle s influential emphasis was upon the  theoretical  steps of
universal rules from raw data  and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself

predictions that are testable by experiment or observation  the predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought  as proof that no tampering has occurred  disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress  this is done partly through observation of natural phenomena  but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline  in the observational sciences  such as astronomy or geology  a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment   experimentation is especially important in science to help establish

when a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory  it is either modified or discarded  if the hypothesis survived testing  it may become adopted into the framework of a   a logically reasoned  self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena  a theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis  commonly  a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory  thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses  in that vein  theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses  in addition to testing hypotheses  scientists may also generate a   an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical  physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested  based on observable phenomena 
while performing experiments to test hypotheses  scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another  and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias  this can be achieved by careful   transparency  and a thorough
process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions  after the results of an experiment are announced or published  it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed  and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be  taken in its entirety  the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users  especially the

whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate  some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists  regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments  others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses  mathematical

philosophy of science

working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method   1  that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers   2  that this objective reality is governed by natural laws   3  that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation  philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid 
the belief that scientific theories should and do represent
reality is known as   it can be contrasted with   the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as   one form of anti-realism is   the belief that the mind or
is the most basic essence  and that each mind generates its own reality  in an idealistic   what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds 
is a work by archimedes in which he sets out to determine an upper bound for the number of grains of sand that fit into the universe  in order to do this  he had to estimate the size of the universe according to the contemporary model  and invent a way to analyze extremely large numbers 
there are different schools of thought in philosophy of science  the most popular position is   which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations  empiricism generally encompasses   a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories  this is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite  which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using
only  many versions of empiricism exist  with the predominant ones being
and the   p236
empiricism has stood in contrast to   the position originally associated with   which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect  not by observation  p20
is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science  first defined by austrian-british philosopher   popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation  he claimed that theories are not generated by observation  but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it  pp637 popper proposed replacing verifiability with
as the landmark of scientific theories  and replacing induction with
as the empirical method  p68 popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method  not specific to science  the negative method of criticism    it covers all products of the human mind  including science  mathematics  philosophy  and art 
another approach    colloquially termed  shut up and multiply   emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena  it views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input  initial conditions  and output  predictions  being relevant  consequences  theoretical entities  and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn t make a fuss about  see    close to instrumentalism is   according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true 
advanced the idea of   which holds that there are no useful and exception-free
governing the
or the growth of   and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic  pernicious and detrimental to science itself  feyerabend advocates treating science as an
alongside others such as     and   and considers the dominance of science in society
and unjustified  he also contended  along with     that the
of distinguishing science from
on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed  universal rules  feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts  particularly the notion of  
finally  another approach often cited in debates of
against controversial movements like    is   its main point is that a difference between natural and
explanations should be made  and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations  that the restriction is merely methodological  rather than ontological  means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself  but should not claim them to be wrong either  instead  supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief   methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to
study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for
phenomena  the absence of these standards    biased

are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize

new scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding  according to psychologist   it may be the media s overuse of words like  breakthrough  that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false  119138 while there are such famous cases as the
that required a complete reconceptualization  these are extreme exceptions  knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various

argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome  verbal  or
is fruitlessbut also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense  he held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference  no stronger than its weakest link  but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected 
stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a  magic bullet   it avoids the   this means a scientist would not ask merely  what is the cause of      but rather  what are the most significant causes of      this is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science  e g       141147 of course 
often analyzes few factors at once  but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider  141147 for example  knowing the details of only a person s genetics  or their history and upbringing  or the current situation may not explain a behavior  but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive 
fringe science  pseudoscience  and junk science
an area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as     or   physicist
coined the term    for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the  kind of utter honesty  that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated  various types of commercial advertising  ranging from hype to fraud  may fall into these categories 
there can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates  sometimes  research may be characterized as  bad science   research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect  obsolete  incomplete  or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas  the term    refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person 
scientific practice
became much more
after
devised his
for measuring angles between two   before the invention of the telescope 
were the basis for  
although encyclopedias such as pliny s  fl  77 ad 
offered purported fact  they proved unreliable  a skeptical point of view  demanding a method of proof  was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge  as early as 1000 years ago  scholars such as
          francis bacon  1605   and
 18391914  provided the
to address these points of uncertainty  in particular  fallacious reasoning can be exposed  such as    
 if a man will begin with certainties  he shall end in doubts  but if he will be content to begin with doubts  he shall end in certainties  
      book 1  v  8
the methods of
into a problem have been known for thousands of years  and extend beyond theory to practice  the use of   for example  is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community 
points out that
is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge  p44 ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries  he refers to this ability as  perceptual consensibility   p46 he then makes consensibility  leading to consensus  the touchstone of reliable knowledge  p104
basic and applied research
anthropogenic
has an effect on the earth s environment and
although some scientific research is
into specific problems  a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of   this leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable  this point was made by michael faraday when allegedly in response to the question  what is the use of basic research   he responded  sir  what is the use of a new-born child    for example  research into the effects of red light on the human eye s
did not seem to have any practical purpose  eventually  the discovery that our
is not troubled by red light would lead
teams  among others  to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters  106110 in a nutshell  basic research is the search for knowledge  and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge  finally  even basic research can take unexpected turns  and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to  
research in practice
due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists  most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists  rather than individuals  d k  simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far  creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked  hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is  in his view  the future of science 
practical impacts of scientific research
discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing  for example
