of which france was the principal example and the
exemplified by the german peoples  the german tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers  like   and referred to people sharing a common language  religion  culture  history  and   that differentiate them from people of other nations  on the other hand  the civic nation was traced to the

the 18th century brought an alteration to the meaning of the term  nation   which became more narrowly referred to as a group with a recognizable and sovereign government with physical borders  this new definition aligns more with the concept of a nation-state  the nation began to emerge in the late 18th century as the leading form of government and social organization  in the americas  the catalyst that brought about this change in meaning was the influence of the african diaspora and its people in other states    national identity brought rights to vote  to hold office  and independence for a growing number of black territories held under colonial rule 
this change occurred in the new world as africans were brought as enslaved peoples    the white population of the new world considered these aliens to be in one category of nation that was based entirely on color and continent of origin  the identity of the enslaved at the time was then shaped by their skin color rather than what nation or tribe they truly originated from  prior to the 18th and 19th centuries  the term mainly referred to a group of people unified by language  region and cultural background  what is now considered to be one s ethnicity  it was through the process of emancipation and the end of the slave trade that the concept of nation began to change  as the previously enslaved began to fight for rights they had to discover what kind of rights they were searching for  it was in this process of emancipation that nationality began to take on a different meaning  language and cultural background were no longer the only requirements of nation  instead  now the idea of an established government and physical boundaries also shaped what it meant to be a nation 
however  within the diaspora  particularly among groups that have been politicized  the term nation has been used to describe a more abstract national experience  one that transcends physical borders and language differences  this description of nation is pinned to the shared experience of being radicalized and termed as black  the expansion of
demonstrates that although some expanded the view that nation requires definable boundaries  those who shared the experience of the diaspora also found a nationality among themselves
