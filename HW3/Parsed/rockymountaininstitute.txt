history  
in 1978  experimental physicist
had published many books  consulted widely  and was active in energy affairs in some fifteen countries as synthesist and lobbyist  lovins is a main theorist of the  
later in 1979  lovins married   a lawyer  forester  and social scientist  hunter received her undergraduate degree in
and
studies from   and her
from  s   in 1982  amory and hunter founded rocky mountain institute  based in colorado  together with a group of colleagues  the lovinses fostered efficient resource use and policy development that they believed would promote global security  rmi ultimately grew into an organization with a staff of around fifty  by the mid 1980s  the lovinses were being featured on major network tv programs  such as  
at rmi s headquarters the south-facing building complex is so energy-efficient that  even with local -40f  -40c  winter temperatures  the building interiors can maintain a comfortable temperature solely from the sunlight admitted plus the body heat of the people who work there  the environment can actually nurture semi-tropical and tropical indoor plants 
the lovinses described the  hard energy path  as involving inefficient liquid-fuel automotive transport  as well as giant centralized electricity-generating facilities  often burning
such as
or   or harnessing a   greatly complicated by electricity wastage and loss  the  soft energy path  which they wholly preferred involves efficient use of energy  diversity of energy production methods  and matched in scale and quality to end uses   and special reliance on  soft technologies   alternative technology  such as       and   according to the institute  large-scale electricity production facilities had an important place  but it was a place that they were already filling in the middle 1970s  in general  more would not be needed  in a 1989 speech  amory lovins introduced the related concept of   in which the creation of a market for trading increased efficiency could supply additional electrical energy to consumers without increasing generation capacitysuch as building more power plants 
in recent years  rmi has convened a team of designers and engineers to develop a super-efficient prototype automobile  which they ve dubbed the
