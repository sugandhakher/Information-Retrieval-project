the emissions decline 7.7  in 20082009 was at least partly influenced by the european economic recession of 20082009 and not only by the sustainable changes in energy consumption  from 2008 to 2009 the change in the
was a 7.0  decline and in
was a 9.6  decline 
a report was published in 2011 by the
in association with   entitled policies for the future  2011 assessment of country energy and climate policies  which ranks country performance according to an energy sustainability index  the best performers were switzerland  sweden and france 
buildings and the residential sector currently account for 40 percent of sweden s energy consumption  buildings have a long life-span  thus energy efficiency is important for houses being built  better energy efficiency for existing buildings is the biggest challenge 
renewable energy  
the share of renewable energy use is high in sweden  hydro  wind  and solar power together accounted for 49.8  of the electricity produced in the country in 2014  when measured against national electricity consumption  however  this amount rises to 55.5    since 2003  sweden has supported renewable energy in the electricity sector with a  green electricity certificate  obligation for retail power suppliers  the current plan of the certificate system is to support 25 twh of new renewable electricity generation by 2020 
within the context of the european union s 2009   sweden is working towards reaching a 50  share of renewable energy in gross final consumption of energy - electricity  heating cooling  and transportation - by 2020 
reported that sweden had already exceeded the directive s 2020 target in 2014 
in 2013 renewable energy investment was more than us 1 billion in sweden 
wind power  
main article 
further information 
accounted for 2.4  of the electricity production in sweden in 2010  5  in 2012 
sweden has
potential of 510 twh a at land and 46 twh a at sea 
consumption was 140 twh of power in 2010 
in 2013 sweden was second top country for wind power capacity per inhabitant in the world  488 w per person  in correlation one must note that swedish use of energy per inhabitant is much higher than average in europe

wave power  
sweden has a
station outside  
hydroelectric power  
accounts for more than half of energy production  more than 1900 power stations operate all over the country  forty-five produce 100 mw and over  17 produce 200 mw and over  and 6 produce 400 mw and over  the largest station  which is located on the upper   has a maximum production capacity of 977 mw  the
is also the most productive river  with almost 18  of the swedish installed effect  almost all of the medium to large plants are located in northern sweden 
solar power  
while installations have historically been minimal  solar power has recently been growing quickly in sweden with the country s cumulative
capacity nearly doubling in 2014 to 79 mw 
biofuels  
further information 
sweden aims for a fossil fuel free vehicle fleet by 2030 
sweden published the sustainability criteria for biofuels  2011  which consider the areas with high biological values to be protected in respect to fuels production  the feedstock origin used for production of bioliquids in sweden during 2011 was sweden 49  the netherlands 17  united states 17  finland 6  belgium 3  and other 8   brazil  malaysia and russia  
is often pointed out as a dirty feed-stock for biofuels  none of the swedish companies used palm oil in 2011  the largest share of feedstock for bioliquids comes from the forest industry in the form of  
and  
in 2013 the bus fleets in more than a dozen cities relied entirely on biomethane  local plants produced more than 60  of the total biomethane used in swedish natural gas vehicles  and more filling stations were opened in 2012 and 2013  goteborg energi  gothenburg energy  has a 20 mw facility that gasifies forest residues and then converts the synthesis gaseshydrogen and carbon monoxideinto biomethane 
thermal and nuclear  
nuclear is dominating in this sector  the other operational plant is  in almost all cases  fueled with renewable fuels  oil plants are few  and are either decommissioned or used as a reserve 
nuclear power  
main article 
more than 35  of the swedish electricity is produced by 10   spread out on 3 power stations 
- 3   1    4,2
- 3 bwrs  one of them is also world s largest bwr    2,6 gw
- 3 bwrs   3,2 gw
before 2005  there were 12 reactors  but the two bwr reactors   1,2 gw  at the
were decommissioned in 1999 and 2005 
global warming  
main article 
according to energy information administration the co2 emissions from energy consumption of sweden were in 2009 54.77 mt  slightly below
54.86 mt  despite the difference in the population  the emissions per capita were in sweden 5.58 and in finland 9.93 tonnes per capita in 2009
