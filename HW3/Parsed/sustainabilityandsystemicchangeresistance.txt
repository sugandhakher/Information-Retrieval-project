has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways  but little progress has been made  as shown by severe
overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the
problem  something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior  that system trait is systemic change resistance  change resistance is also known as organizational resistance  barriers to change  or policy resistance

overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem  
while environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change  the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first
in 1970  in which over 20 million people participated  with publication of
in 1972  and with the first
in stockholm in 1972  early expectations the problem could be solved ran high  114 out of 132 members of the united nations attended the stockholm conference  the conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success 
 many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation  the nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment  particularly the oceans and the atmosphere  and they signed a declaration of principles  after extensive negotiations  concerning their obligations  the conference also approved an environmental fund and an action program  which involved 200 specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change  marine pollution  population growth  the dumping of toxic wastes  and the preservation of biodiversity  a permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts   this later became  the united nations environmental program  which was  was formally approved by the general assembly later that same year and its base established in nairobi  kenya  this organization not only coordinated action but monitored research  collecting and disseminating information  and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues 
 the conference in stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned  it was widely considered successful  and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement  
however  despite the work of a worldwide   many national environmental protection agencies  creation of the   and many international environmental treaties  the sustainability problem continues to grow worse  the latest
data shows the worlds footprint increased from about 50  undershoot in 1961 to 50  overshoot in 2007  the last year data is available 
in 1972 the first edition of the limits to growth analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a
model  the widely influential book predicted that 
 if the present trends in world population  industrialization  pollution  food production  and resource depletion continue unchanged  the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years  the most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century  
yet thirty-two years later in 2004 the third edition reported that 
  the second edition of limits to growth  was published in 1992  the year of the global summit on environment and development in rio de janeiro  the advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems  but we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of rio  the rio plus 10 conference in johannesburg in 2002 produced even less  it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes   due to  the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national  corporate  or individual self-interests 
    humanity has largely squandered the past 30 years  
change resistance runs so high that the worlds top two greenhouse gas emitters 
and the   have never adopted the
treaty  in the us resistance was so strong that in 1999 the us senate voted 95 to zero against the treaty by passing the   despite the fact
was vice-president at the time  not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty  which has not been brought back to the floor since 
due to prolonged change resistance  the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis 
emissions are rising much faster than
models expected  the growth rate of  fossil fuel  emissions was 3.5  per year for 2000-2007  an almost four fold increase from 0.9  per year in 1990-1999   this makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case ipcc-sres scenario 
the
of december 2009 ended in failure  no agreement on binding targets was reached  the
in december 2010 did not break the deadlock  the best it could do was another non-binding agreement 
recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet  and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all parties 
this indicates no progress at all since 1992  when the
was created at the
in   the 2010 cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the 1992 agreement said 
 the parties to this convention     acknowledge  that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response      thus the parties recognize  that states should enact effective environmental legislation     to  protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind     
negotiations have bogged down so pervasively that  climate policy is gridlocked  and theres virtually no chance of a breakthrough 
climate policy  as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the kyoto protocol approach  has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years 
these events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable 
the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems  
understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem  tanya markvarts 2009 thesis on understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability stated that 
 it has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change  even in the face of social-ecological degradation and or collapse  e g   berkes   folke  2002  allison   hobbs  2004  brown  2005  runnalls  2008  finley  2009  walker et al   2009   
the thesis focuses specifically on developing an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability 
jack harich s 2010 paper on change resistance as the crux of the environmental sustainability problem argues there are two separate problems to solve  a
and a
model were used to explain how 
    difficult social problems  like sustainability must be decomposed  into two sequential subproblems   1  how to overcome change resistance and then  2  how to achieve proper coupling  this is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer  by cleaving one big problem into two  the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve  because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately  we are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously  
the paper discussed the two subproblems 
 change resistance is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior  despite the application of force to change that behavior 
 proper coupling occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner  using the appropriate   so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives   in the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within  the environment 
 change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction  society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so  but society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices  as a result  problem solvers have created thousands of effective  and often ingenious  proper practices  but they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an  implicit system goal  is causing insurmountable change resistance  therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first  
the proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as the problem to solve  it is called
in economic and environmental fields  where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation  solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular   ecological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded 
change resistance is also called barriers to change  hoffman and bazerman  in a chapter on understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action  concluded that 
 in this chapter  we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change  the implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers  
  current leader of the system dynamics school of thought  came to the same conclusion 
 the civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge  then  as now  entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change   of course  we need more research and technical innovationmoney and genius are always in short supply  but there is no purely technical solution for climate change  for public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science  we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change  
these findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved  change resistance and proper coupling  given the human systems long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode  it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling  this may be expressed as an emerging principle  systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first  before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within  the environment 
systemic versus individual change resistance  
systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance  systemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types  as opposed to originating from individual agents 
individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations  how the two differ may be seen in this passage 
 the notion of resistance to change is credited to kurt lewin  his conceptualization of the phrase  however  is very different from todays usage   which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept  where resistance or support of change comes from values  habits  mental models  and so on residing within the individual  for lewin  resistance to change could occur  but that resistance could be anywhere in the system  as kotter  1995  found  it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual  but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system 
 systems of social roles  with their associated patterns of attitudes  expectations  and behavior norms  share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasisi e   tendencies to resist change  to restore the previous state after a disturbance 
 lewin had been working on this idea  that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change  since 1928 as part of his field theory  he believed that some difference in these forcesweakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forceswas required to produce the unfreezing that began a change  
if sources of systemic change resistance are present  they are the principal cause of individual change resistance  according to the
it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining  reasoning  inspirational appeals  and so on  this is because 
 a fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior  however  people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors  that is  to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting  the tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the  fundamental attribution error    
  a thought leader of
for the business world  describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an implicit system goal 
 in general  balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening  theres no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures  or nuclear arms  or lily pads  instead  the balancing process maintains the status quo  even when all participants want change  the feeling  as lewis carrolls queen of hearts put it  of needing all the running you can do to keep in the same place is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby 
 leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes  to the leaders  it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere  in fact  as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout  the resistance is a response by the system  trying to maintain an implicit system goal  until this goal is recognized  the change effort is doomed to failure  
senges insight applies to the sustainability problem  until the implicit system goal causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved  change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be  as senge argues  doomed to failure 
the current focus is on proper coupling  
presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem  for example  the following are all proper coupling solutions  they attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problems symptoms 
the
the
of reduce  reuse  recycle
more use of
better
of many kinds
collective management of
certification programs to reduce deforestation such as
and
to reduce soil erosion
the
the direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the
where impact equals population times affluence  consumption per person  times technology  environmental impact per unit of consumption   it is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce 
the top environmental organization in the world  the
 unep   focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions 
 2010 marked the beginning of a period of new  strategic and transformational direction for unep as it began implementing its medium term strategy  mts  for 2010-2013 across six areas  climate change  disasters and conflicts  ecosystem management  environmental governance  harmful substances and hazardous waste  resource efficiency  sustainable consumption and production  
the six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the i pat equation 
  2006 documentary film
described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it  the film concluded with gore saying 
 each one of us is a cause of global warming  but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy  the electricity we use  the cars we drive  we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero  the solutions are in our hands  we just have to have the determination to make it happen  we have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions  everything but political will  but in america  the will to act is a renewable resource  
the four solutions gore mentions are proper coupling practices  there is  however  a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge  when gore says    we just have to have the determination to make it happen  we have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions  everything but political will 
the twenty-seven solutions that appear during the films closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions  the first nine are 
go to
you can reduce your carbon emissions  in fact  you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero 
buy energy efficient appliances   light bulbs 
change your thermostat  and use clock thermostats  to reduce energy for heating   cooling 
weatherize your house  increase insulation  get an energy audit 
recycle 
if you can  buy a hybrid car 
when you can  walk or ride a bicycle 
where you can  use light rail   mass transit 
some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance  such as 
tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in 
if you are a parent  join with your children to save the world they will live in 
vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis 
write to congress  if they dont listen  run for congress 
speak up in your community 
however none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance 
overcoming systemic change resistance  
efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve 
on how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem  markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance 
theory and   and concluded that 
    neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and or unproductive institutional and ecological systems  overall  more research is required     
taking a
and
modeling approach  harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a
and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems  several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested  the point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes  once these are found  how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling  the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily  solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system  which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects 
this reaffirms the work of   as expressed in her classic essay on   the final page stated that 
 the higher the leverage point  the more the system will resist changing it  
here meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance  this is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling 
however  if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found  the system will not resist changing them  this is an important principle of social system behavior 
for example  harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high  deception effectiveness   the source was special interests  particularly large for-profit corporations  the high leverage point was raising  general ability to detect manipulative deception   this can be done with a variety of solution elements  such as  the truth test   this effectively increases truth literacy  just as conventional education raises reading and writing   few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious 
promotion of
 csr  has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems  including environmental sustainability  this solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes 
explained why csr fails   the social responsibility of business is to increase profits  
business cannot be responsible to society  it can only be responsible to its shareholders
