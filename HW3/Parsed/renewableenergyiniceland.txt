the
about 85 percent of total
supply in
is derived from domestically produced
sources 
in 2011 
provided about 65 percent of primary energy  the share of
was 20 percent  and the share of
 mainly oil products for the transport sector  was 15 percent  in 2013  iceland also became a producer of wind energy 
the main use of geothermal energy is for
with the heat being distributed to buildings through extensive district-heating systems  about 85  of all houses in iceland are heated with geothermal energy 
renewable energy provides almost 100 percent of
production  with about 75 percent coming from hydropower and 25 percent from geothermal power  most of the hydropower plants are owned by
 the national power company  which is the main supplier of electricity in iceland  in 2011  the total electricity consumption in iceland was 17,210 gwh 
iceland is the worlds largest green energy producer per capita and largest electricity producer per capita

geology  
the
  lying on the mid-atlantic ridge  iceland is one of the most geologically active areas on earth 
allows it to produce renewable energy relatively cheaply  from a variety of sources  iceland is located on the   which makes it one of the most
active places in the world  there are over
located in iceland and over 600   there are over 20 high-temperature steam fields that are at least 150c  300f   many of them reach temperatures of 250c  this is what allows iceland to harness
and these steam fields are used for everything from heating
to heating   hydropower is harnessed through glacial
and   which are both plentiful in iceland 
hydropower  
main article 
the first
plant was built in 1904 by a local   it was located in a small town outside of
and produced 9
of power  the first municipal hydroelectric plant was built in 1921  and it could produce 1
of power  this plant single-handedly quadrupled the amount of
in the country  the 1950s marked the next evolution in   two plants were built on the   one in 1953 which produced 31 mw  and the other in 1959 which produced 26.4 mw  these two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co-owned by the   this process continued in 1965 when the national power company    was founded  it was owned by both the icelandic government and the municipality of   in 1969  they built a 210 mw plant on the
that would supply the
of
with electricity and run an
plant that could produce 33,000 of aluminum a year 
this trend continued and increases in the production of
are directly related to   in 2005  landsvirkjun produced 7,143
of electricity total of which 6,676 gwh or 93  was produced via hydroelectric   additionally 5,193 gwh or 72  was used for power-intensive
like aluminum smelting  in 2009 iceland built its biggest
project to date  a 690 mw hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter  the   this project was opposed strongly by  
other hydroelectric power stations in iceland include  blndust  150 mw   brfellsst  270 mw   hrauneyjafosst  210 mw   laxrstvar  28 mw   sigldust  150 mw   sogsstvar  89 mw   sultartangast  120 mw   and
 90 mw  
iceland is the first
in the world to create an
generated through industries fueled by   and there is still a large amount of untapped hydroelectric energy in iceland  in 2002 it was estimated that iceland only generated 17  of the total harnessable
in the country  icelands government believes another 30
of hydropower every year could be produced  whilst taking into account the sources that must remain untapped for environmental reasons 
geothermal power  
main article 
krafla geothermal station
for centuries  the
have used their
for
and
clothes  the first use of
for
did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a
pipe from a hot spring that led
into his house  in 1930  the first
was constructed in   and was used to heat two   60   and the main   it was a 3km pipeline that ran from one of the hot springs outside the city  in 1943  the first
company was started with the use of geothermal power  an 18km pipeline ran through the city of reykjavk and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes 
currently geothermal power heats 89  of the houses in iceland and over 54  of the
used in iceland comes from geothermal sources  geothermal power is used for many things in iceland  57.4  of the energy is used for space heat  25  is used for electricity  and the remaining amount is used in many miscellaneous areas      and   for example 
the government of iceland has played a major role in the advancement of   in the 1940s  the state electricity authority was started by the government in order to increase the knowledge of geothermal resources and the utilization of geothermal power in iceland  it was later changed to the national energy authority    in 1967  this agency has been very successful and has made it economically
to use geothermal energy as a source for
in many different areas throughout the country  geothermal power has been so successful that the government no longer has to lead the
in this field because it has been taken over by the
 
geothermal power plants in iceland include
 120mw  
 100mw  
 303mw  
 60mw   and
 46.5mw  power plants  the svartsengi power plant and the nesjavellir power plant produce both electricity and hot-water for heating purposes  the move from -based heating to geothermal heating saved iceland an estimated total of 8.2 billion from 1970 to 2000 and lowered the release of
by 37   the equivalent amount of oil that would have been needed in 2003 to heat icelands homes was 646,000tons 
the icelandic government also believes that there are many more untapped geothermal sources throughout the country  estimating that over 20 twh per year of unharnessed geothermal energy is available  this is about 3.3  of the 600twh per year of electricity used in   combined with the unharnessed feasible hydropower  tapping these sources to their full extent would provide iceland another 50 twh of energy per year  all from renewable sources 
iceland s abundant geothermal energy has also enabled renewable energy initiatives  such as  s carbon dioxide to methanol fuel process  which could help reduce iceland s dependence on fossil fuels 
solar power  
main article 
source  nrel
solar insolation
iceland has relatively low   due to the latitude  about 20  less than paris  and half as much as   with very little in the winter  unlike geothermal  solar power is a non-dispatchable renewable energy source - the sun follows a predictable path but the weather is not controllable  this makes both wind power and solar power variable renewable energy  vre  sources 
credits electricity generated during the summer for use during the winter  if net metering nor local energy storage is not available  the largest array that is practical for a consumer to install is that which will generate less than or equal to the amount of electricity used during the sunniest month  a much smaller array 
hydrogen  
currently 
fulfils most of iceland s remaining energy needs  this cost has caused iceland to focus on domestic  renewable energy    a local professor  first proposed the idea of using
source in iceland during the 1970s  which is also when the
occurred  at that point in time this idea was considered untenable  but in 1999
was established to govern the project of transitioning iceland into the first hydrogen society by 2050  this followed a decision in 1998 by the
to convert
and
fleets to hydrogen produced from renewable energy 
iceland provides an ideal location to test the viability of
as a
source for the future  since it is a small country of only 320,000 people  with over 60  living in the     the relatively small scale of the infrastructure will make it easier to transition the country from oil to hydrogen  there is also a plentiful supply of natural energy that can be harnessed to produce hydrogen in a
way  making it perfect for hydrogen production  iceland is a participant in international hydrogen fuel research and development programs  and many countries are following the nation s progress with interest  however  these factors also make iceland an advantageous market for electric vehicles  because electric vehicles are four times more efficient  and less expensive than hydrogen vehicles  the country may switch to electric vehicles 
iceland already converts its surplus electricity into exportable goods and
replacements  in 2002 it produced 2,000 tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysisprimarily for the production of
for  
ectos demonstration project
a hydrogen filling station in reykjavk
the first step towards becoming a hydrogen society was the
demonstration project  which ran from 2001 until august 2005 and was very successful  ectos    involved three hydrogen
buses and one   many international companies contributed to the project including   who made the hydrogen fuel cell buses  and
which produced the hydrogen fuel station  the
5th framework programme sponsored the project 
the first
in iceland opened in 2003 in   to avoid transportation difficulties hydrogen is produced on site using
to break down
into hydrogen and   all of the energy used to produce the hydrogen comes from icelands renewable energies and the full cycle of energy  from the water to the hydrogen in the fuel cells  emits no  
during the project the researchers studied the
of using
as a fuel source  they examined the reliability of the fuel and effectiveness of hydrogen as a fuel in   they also studied the cost effectiveness of using hydrogen as a fuel source and how the process of introducing hydrogen into the
could be implemented  they examined specific areas like the ease of incorporating fuel stations and producing hydrogen  and the
involved with distributing and using hydrogen  a very
fuel 
hyfleet cute project
in january 2006 it was decided to continue testing the hydrogen buses as part of the
project  which spans 10 cities in europe  china and australia and which is sponsored by the  s 6th framework programme  this project studies the long-term effects and most efficient ways of using
buses  the buses are run for longer periods of time and the durability of the
is compared to the   which can theoretically last a lot longer  the project also compares the fuel efficiency of the original buses with new buses from different manufacturers that are supposed to be more fuel efficient 
the project ended in january 2007  and as a result of the research an improved
is expected in 2008  details of further demonstrations involving private
and a
were expected in april 2007 
other projects
iceland has also begun many other projects involving hydrogen 
the euro-hyport project is investigating the feasibility of exporting hydrogen fuel to europe  options include
the
through an undersea pipeline or by boat  or exporting electricity generated in iceland through a  
another project to build a hydrogen-powered h- started in february 2004 and is looking at the practicalities of using hydrogen as a fuel for iceland s fishing fleet  one of the country s main industries  the project will identify and try to remove barriers that may prevent
from using hydrogen as a fuel  such as problems caused by
and   it will also try to identify and remedy weakness within the
to ensure the protection of   the h-ship project is a major step in the plan for iceland to become the first country to phase out the use of   government funding as well as private organizations such as the world renewable energy congress are the primary sponsors of research in this sector 
from hydrogen to electricity
electric cars with strategically located
make a lot of sense for iceland  where 75 percent of the countrys residents live within 37 miles of the capital city  hydrogen cars are not expected to be mass-produced anywhere in the world until at least 2015  and with the first electric cars rolling off production lines in 2010  it will be faster to introduce electric vehicles  iceland s 840-mile-long ring road could theoretically be covered with just 14 fast-charging stations 
education and research  
there are several educational institutions that offering education in renewable energy in iceland on university level 
the university of iceland is a progressive educational and scientific institution  renowned in the global scientific community for its research  it is a state university  situated in reykjavk  the capital of iceland  a modern  diversified and rapidly developing institution  the university of iceland offers opportunities for study and research in almost 300 programmes spanning most fields of science and scholarship  social sciences  health sciences  humanities  sciences and engineering  some 9700 students are registered at ui and 1000 full-time employees
