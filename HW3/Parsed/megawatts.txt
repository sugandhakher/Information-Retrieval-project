common multiples are in bold face
femtowatt  
the femtowatt is equal to one quadrillionth  1015  of a watt  technologically important powers that are measured in femtowatts are typically found in reference s  to
and
receivers  for example  meaningful fm tuner performance figures for sensitivity  quieting and signal-to-noise require that the rf energy applied to the antenna input be specified  these input levels are often stated in dbf   referenced to 1 femtowatt   this is 0.2739 microvolt across a 75-ohm load or 0.5477 microvolt across a 300-ohm load  the specification takes into account the rf input impedance of the tuner 
picowatt  
the picowatt is equal to one trillionth  1012  of a watt  technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers  acoustics and in the science of  
nanowatt  
the nanowatt is equal to one billionth  109  of a watt  important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers 
microwatt  
the microwatt is equal to one millionth  106  of a watt  important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in
systems such as the
and the   in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers  compact
for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts 
milliwatt  
the milliwatt is equal to one thousandth  103  of a watt  a typical
outputs about five milliwatts of light power  whereas a typical
for people uses less than one milliwatt 
and other electronic signal levels are often measured in   referenced to one milliwatt 
kilowatt  
 kilowatt  and  kilowatts  redirect here  for the place in the united states  see   for the musician james watts  see  
 kw  redirects here  for other uses  see  
the kilowatt is equal to one thousand  103  watts  this unit is typically used to express the output power of
and the power of electric motors  tools  machines  and heaters  it is also a common unit used to express the
power output of broadcast radio and television  
one kilowatt is approximately equal to 1.34   a small electric heater with one heating element can use 1.0 kilowatt  the average electric power consumption of a household in the united states is about one kilowatt 
also  kilowatts of
power can be measured in the output pulses of some  
a surface area of one square meter on earth receives typically about one kilowatt of
from the sun  the    on a clear day at mid day  close to the equator  
megawatt  
the megawatt is equal to one million  106  watts  many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale  including large electric motors  large
such as     and   large
or   and some scientific research equipment  such as   and the output pulses of very large lasers  a large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat  on railways  modern high-powered
typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6mw  although some produce much more  the   for example  uses more than 12mw  while heavy
typically produce use 3 to 5mw  u s 
have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300mw 
the earliest citing of the megawatt in the
 oed  is a reference in the 1900   the oed also states that megawatt appeared in a 28 november 1947 article in the journal
 506 2  
gigawatt  
the gigawatt is equal to one billion  109  watts or 1 gigawatt   1000 megawatts  this unit is often used for large power plants or power grids  for example  by the end of 2010 power shortages in china s shanxi province were expected to increase to 56 gw and the installed capacity of wind power in germany was 25.8 gw  the largest unit  out of four  of the belgian
has a peak output of 1.04 gw 
have been built with power ratings of up to 2gw 
terawatt  
the terawatt is equal to one trillion  1012  watts  the total power used by humans worldwide is commonly measured in terawatts  see    the most powerful
from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s produced power in terawatts  but only for
time frames  the average
strike peaks at 1 terawatt  but these strikes only last for 30  
petawatt  
the petawatt is equal to one quadrillion  1015  watts and can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time-scales on the order of picoseconds  1012s   one such laser is the lawrence livermore s   which achieved a power output of 1.25pw  70151250000000000001.251015w  by a process called   the duration of the pulse was roughly 0.5  698750000000000000051013s   giving a total energy of 600j  or enough energy to power a 100w light bulb for six seconds  another example is the laser for fast ignition experiments  lfex  at the institute of laser engineering  ile     which achieved a power output of 2pw  701520000000000000021015w  for a duration of approximately 1 
based on the average
of 1.366kw m2  the total power of
striking earth s atmosphere is estimated at 174pw  see    
electrical and thermal watts  
in the electric power industry  megawatt electrical  mwe or mwe  is   while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt  mwt  mwt  or mwth  mwth  refers to thermal power produced  other
are sometimes used  for example gigawatt electrical  gwe   the   which maintains the si-standard  states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol  i e   pthermal 270w rather than p 270wth  and regards these symbols as incorrect and thus non-si 
for example  the
in argentina uses a
to generate 2109mwt  i e  heat   which creates steam to drive a turbine  which generates 648mwe  i e  electricity  
radio transmission  
main article 
usually report the power of their transmitters in units of watts  referring to the   it refers to the relative power of the transmission when it is directed towards the horizon for maximum geographic coverage  rather than uniformly broadcast in all directions 
confusion of watts  watt-hours and watts per hour  
this section needs additional citations for   please help
by   unsourced material may be challenged and removed   july 2016    
the terms
and
are frequently confused  power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units  e g  watts  that represent energy per unit time 
for example  when a light bulb with a power rating of 100w is turned on for one hour  the energy used is 100  wh   0.1kilowatt hour  or 360   this same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5hours  or a 50-watt bulb for 2hours  a power station would be rated in multiples of watts  for example  the
is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts   but its annual energy sales or output would be in multiples of watt hours  major energy production or consumption is often expressed as
for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year  one terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year 
the
is a unit of energy  equal to the   one kilowatt hour is 3 600 000 watt seconds  the watt second is used  for example  to rate the energy storage of
used in photography  although the term joule is generally employed 
terms such as watts per hour  w h  are often misused when watts would be correct  watts per hour properly refers to a change of power per hour  watts per hour might be useful to characterize the ramp-up behavior of   for example  a power plant that changes its power output from 0mw to 1mw in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4mw h 
power plants have a very high ramp-up rate  which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations  the
watts per hour is essentially the
of
and should be called rate of watt change per hour

notes  
the energy in climbing the stairs is given by mgh  setting m 100kg  g 9.8m s2 and h 3m gives 2940j  dividing this by the time taken  5s  gives a power of 588w 
average household electric power consumption is 1.19kw in the us  0.53kw in the uk  in india it is 0.13kw  urban  and 0.03kw  rural   computed from gj figures quoted by nakagami  murakoshi and iwafune
