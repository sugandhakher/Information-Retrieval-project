the gorlov helical turbine  ght  is a
evolved from the
design by altering it to have
blades foils  it was patented in a series of patents from september 19  1995 to july 3  2001 and won 2001
thomas a 
  ght was invented by professor
of  
a m gorlov with his turbine 
the physical principles of the ght work are the same as for its main prototype  the darrieus turbine  and for the family of similar
which includes also
  ght  turby and quietrevolution solved pulsatory
issues by using the helical twist of the blades

fluid performance  
the term  foil  is used to describe the shape of the blade cross-section at a given point  with no distinction for the type of fluid   thus referring to either an    or      in the helical design  the blades curve around the axis  which has the effect of evenly distributing the foil sections throughout the rotation cycle  so there is always a foil section at every possible   in this way  the sum of the lift and drag forces on each blade do not change abruptly with rotation angle  the turbine generates a smoother torque curve  so there is much less vibration and noise than in the darrieus design  it also minimizes peak stresses in the structure and materials  and facilitates self-starting of the turbine  in testing environments the ght has been observed to have up to 35  efficiency in energy capture reported by several groups   among the other vertical-axis turbine systems  the davis hydro turbine  the encurrent turbine  and the gorlov helical turbine have all undergone scale testing at laboratory or sea  overall  these technologies represent the current norm of tidal current development  
turbine axis-orientation  
the main difference between the gorlov helical turbine and conventional turbines is the orientation of the axis in relation to current flow  the ght is a
which means the axis is positioned perpendicular to current flow  whereas traditional turbines are
which means the axis is positioned parallel to the flow of the current  fluid flows  such as wind  will naturally change direction  however they will still remain parallel to the ground  so in all vertical-axis turbines  the flow remains perpendicular to the axis  regardless of the flow direction  and the turbines always rotate in the same direction  this is one of the main advantages of vertical-axis turbines 
if the direction of the water flow is fixed  then the gorlov turbine axis could be vertical or horizontal  the only requirement is orthogonality to the flow 
airfoil   hydrofoil  
the ght operates under a -based concept  see    the foil sections on the ght are symmetrical  both top-to-bottom and also from the leading-to-trailing edge  the ght can actually spin equally well in either direction  the ght works under the same principle as the darrieus turbine  that is  it relies upon the movement of the foils in order to change the apparent direction of the flow relative to the foils  and thus change the  apparent   angle of attack  of the foil 
environmental issues  
a ght is proposed for
installations  when construction of a
is undesirable  the ght is an example of
technology  the technology may potentially offer cost and environmental benefits over dam-based micro-hydro systems 
some advantages of damless hydro are that it eliminates the potential for failure of a dam  which improves public safety  it also eliminates the initial cost of dam engineering  construction and maintenance  reduces the environmental and ecological complications  and potentially simplifies the regulatory issues put into law specifically to mitigate the problems with dams 
in general  a major ecological issue with hydropower installations is their actual and perceived risk to aquatic life  it is claimed that a ght spins slowly enough that fish can see it soon enough to swim around it  from preliminary tests in 2001  it was claimed that if a fish swims between the slowly moving turbine blades  the fish will not be harmed  also it would be difficult for a fish to become lodged or stuck in the turbine  because the open spaces between the blades are larger than even the largest fish living in a small river  a fish also would not be tumbled around in a   because the ght does not create a lot of turbulence  so small objects would be harmlessly swept through with the current 
how it works  
current flow to the left 
induced flow component created by clockwise rotation of turbine 
in this example the direction of the fluid flow is to the left 
as the turbine rotates  in this case in a clockwise direction  the motion of the foil through the fluid changes the
and
 speed and direction  of the fluid with respect to the
of the foil  the combined effect of these two flow components  i e  the
sum   yields the net total  apparent flow velocity  as shown in the next figure 
apparent flow velocity of turbine blade  and angle made with current flow over ground  in degrees  
net force vectors 
the action of this apparent flow on each foil section generates both a
and
force  the sum of which is shown in the figure above titled  net force vectors   each of these net force vectors can be split into two orthogonal vectors  a radial component and a tangential component  shown here as  normal force  and  axial force  respectively  the normal forces are opposed by the rigidity of the turbine structure and do not impart any rotational force or energy to the turbine  the remaining force component propels the turbine in the clockwise direction  and it is from this
that energy can be harvested 
 with regards to the figure above left  apparent flow velocity      lucid energy technologies  rights holder to the patent to the gorlov helical turbine  notes that this diagram  with no apparent velocity at an azimuth angle of 180 degrees  blade at its point in rotation where it is instantaneously moving in downstream direction   may be subject to misinterpretation  this is because a zero apparently flow velocity could occur only at a tip speed ratio of unity  i e  tsr 1  where the current flow induced by rotation equals the current flow   the ght generally operates at a tsr substantially greater than unity  
 the diagrams  net force vectors  and  normal force vectors  are partially incorrect  the downwind segments should show the vectors outside the circles  otherwise there would be no net sideways loading on the turbine   m koester 2015

commercial use  
helical turbines in water stream generate mechanical power independent on direction of the water flow  then electric generators assembled upon the common shaft transfer the power into electricity for the commercial use
