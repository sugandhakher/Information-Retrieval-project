geothermal heating is the direct use of
for heating some applications  humans have taken advantage of
heat this way since the paleolithic era  approximately seventy countries made direct use of a total of 270
of geothermal heating in 2004  as of 2007  28
of geothermal heating capacity is installed around the world  satisfying 0.07  of global primary energy consumption 
is high since no energy conversion is needed  but
tend to be low  around 20   since the heat is mostly needed in the winter 
originates from the heat retained within the earth since the original formation of the planet  from
of minerals  and from
absorbed at the surface  most high temperature geothermal heat is harvested in regions close to
where volcanic activity rises close to the surface of the earth  in these areas  ground and groundwater can be found with temperatures higher than the target temperature of the application  however  even cold ground contains heat  below 6 metres  20ft  the undisturbed ground temperature is consistently at the mean annual air temperature and it may be extracted with a

space heating
there are a wide variety of applications for cheap geothermal heat  in 2004 more than half of direct geothermal heat was used for space heating  and a third was used for spas  the remainder was used for a variety of industrial processes  desalination  domestic hot water  and agricultural applications  the cities of
and
pipe hot water from geothermal plants under roads and pavements to melt snow 
has been demonstrated 
geothermal systems tend to benefit from economies of scale  so space heating power is often distributed to multiple buildings  sometimes whole communities  this technique  long practiced throughout the world in locations such as         and  
is known as  
extraction  
main article 
some parts of the world  including substantial portions of the western usa  are underlain by relatively shallow geothermal resources  similar conditions exist in iceland  parts of japan  and other geothermal hot spots around the world  in these areas  water or steam may be captured from natural
and piped directly into
or   alternatively  the heat may come from
supplied by
from a geothermal electrical plant or from deep wells into hot aquifers  direct geothermal heating is far more efficient than geothermal electricity generation and has less demanding temperature requirements  so it is viable over a large geographical range  if the shallow ground is hot but dry  air or water may be circulated through
or
which act as heat exchangers with the ground 
from deep geothermal resources is also used to generate electricity from geothermal power  the
struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m  a cemented steelcase was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma  the high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36mw of electricity  making iddp-1 the worlds first magma-enhanced geothermal system 
in areas where the shallow ground is too cold to provide comfort directly  it is still warmer than the winter air  the
of the shallow ground retains solar energy accumulated in the summertime  and seasonal variations in ground temperature disappear completely below 10m of depth  that heat can be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more efficiently than it can be generated by conventional furnaces  geothermal heat pumps are economically viable essentially anywhere in the world 
ground-source heat pumps  
main article 
in regions without any high temperature geothermal resources  a
 gshp  can provide space heating and space cooling  like a refrigerator or air conditioner  these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground to the building  heat can be extracted from any source  no matter how cold  but a warmer source allows higher efficiency  a ground-source heat pump uses the shallow ground or ground water  typically starting at 1012c or 5054f  as a source of heat  thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderate temperatures  in contrast  an
draws heat from the air  colder outside air  and thus requires more energy 
ground source heat pumps  gshps  are not geothermal  i e  there is no geyser providing heat to be captured  a gshp merely accesses stored solar heat energy in the soil or rock  gshps circulate a carrier fluid  usually a mixture of water and small amounts of antifreeze  through closed pipe loops buried in the ground  single-home systems can be  vertical loop field  systems with bore holes 50400 feet  15120m  deep
or  if adequate land is available for extensive trenches  a  horizontal loop field  is installed approximately six feet subsurface  as the fluid circulates underground it absorbs heat from the ground and  on its return  the warmed fluid passes through the heat pump which uses electricity to extract heat from the fluid  the re-chilled fluid is sent back into the ground thus continuing the cycle  the heat extracted and that generated by the heat pump appliance as a byproduct is used to heat the house  the addition of the ground heating loop in the energy equation means that significantly more heat can be transferred to a building than if electricity alone had been used directly for heating 
switching the direction of heat flow  the same system can be used to circulate the cooled water through the house for cooling in the summer months  the heat is exhausted to the relatively cooler ground  or groundwater  rather than delivering it to the hot outside air as an air conditioner does  as a result  the heat is pumped across a larger temperature difference and this leads to higher efficiency and lower energy use 
this technology makes ground source heating economically viable in any geographical location  in 2004  an estimated million ground-source heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 gw extracted 88 pj of heat energy for space heating  global ground-source heat pump capacity is growing by 10  annually 
history  
the oldest known pool fed by a hot spring  built in the qin dynasty in the 3rd century bc 
have been used for bathing at least since paleolithic times  the oldest known spa is a stone pool on  s
built in the
in the 3rd century bc  at the same site where the
palace was later built  geothermal energy supplied channeled
for baths and houses in
around 0 ad  in the first century ad  romans conquered
in england and used the hot springs there to feed
and   the admission fees for these baths probably represents the first commercial use of geothermal power  a 1,000-year-old hot tub has been located in   where it was built by one of the island s original settlers  the world s oldest working geothermal district heating system in   france  has been operating since the 14th century  the earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract
from volcanic mud in   italy 
in 1892  america s first district heating system in
was powered directly by geothermal energy  and was soon copied in
in 1900  a deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in boise in 1926  and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in iceland and tuscany at about the same time  charlie lieb developed the first
in 1930 to heat his house  steam and hot water from the geysers began to be used to heat homes in iceland in 1943 
by this time 
had already invented the
in 1852  and
had patented the idea of using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912  but it was not until the late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented  the earliest one was probably robert c  webber s home-made 2.2kw direct-exchange system  but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention  j  donald kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the
and demonstrated it in 1946  professor carl nielsen of
built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948  the technology became popular in sweden as a result of the   and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then  the 1979 development of
pipe greatly augmented the heat pumps economic viability  as of 2004  there are over a million geothermal heat pumps installed worldwide providing 12 gw of thermal capacity  each year  about 80,000 units are installed in the usa and 27,000 in sweden 
economics  
geothermal drill machine 
geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy that encourages conservation of natural resources  according to the u s   
systems save homeowners 3070 percent in heating costs  and 2050 percent in cooling costs  compared to conventional systems  geo-exchange systems also save money because they require much less maintenance  in addition to being highly reliable they are built to last for decades 
some utilities  such as   offer special  lower winter rates for geothermal customers  offering even more savings 
geothermal drilling risks  
cracks at the historic town hall of
presumed due to damage from geothermal drilling
in geothermal heating projects the underground is penetrated by trenches or drillholes  as with all underground work  projects may cause problems if the geology of the area is poorly understood 
in the spring of 2007 an exploratory geothermal drilling operation was conducted to provide geothermal heat to the town hall of   after initially sinking a few millimeters  a process called   the city center has started to rise gradually causing considerable damage to buildings in the city center  affecting numerous historic houses including the town hall  it is hypothesized that the drilling perforated an
layer bringing high-pressure
to come into contact with the anhydrite  which then began to expand  currently no end to the rising process is in sight  data from the
radar satellite before and after the changes confirmed the localised nature of the situation 
a geochemical process called
swelling has been confirmed as the cause of these   this is a transformation of the mineral anhydrite  anhydrous calcium sulphate  into
 hydrous calcium sulphate   a pre-condition for this transformation is that the anhydrite is in contact with water  which is then stored in its crystalline structure
