bulk properties  
thorium is a     bright silvery radioactive actinide metal  in the   it is located to the right of the actinide   to the left of the actinide   and below the
  pure thorium is very
and  as normal for metals  can be     and   at room temperature  thorium metal has a
crystal structure  additionally  it has two other forms at exotic conditions  one at high temperature  over 1360c    and one at high pressure  around 100gpa    
the properties of thorium vary widely depending on the amount of impurities in the sample  the major impurity is usually
 tho2   the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide  experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g cm3  these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g cm3 calculated from thorium s   perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast  these values lie intermediate between those of its neighbours actinium  10.1g cm3  and protactinium  15.4g cm3   showing the continuity of trends across the early actinides 
thorium s melting point of 1750c is above both that of actinium  1227c  and that of protactinium  approximately 1560c   in the beginning of period 7  from
to thorium  the melting points of the elements increase  following the trend in the other periods   this is because the number of delocalised electrons that each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium  and there is a greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one in francium to four in thorium  after thorium  there is a new smooth trend downward in the melting points of the early actinides from thorium to
where the number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6  due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals  increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal resulting in increasingly complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding   the f-electron count for thorium is listed as a non-integer due to a 5f6d overlap   among the actinides  thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density  second only to actinium  its boiling point of 4788c is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points  behind only       and  
thorium has a
of 54  comparable to those of
and   the hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft   so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire  nevertheless  while thorium is nearly half as dense as
and plutonium  it is harder than either of them  thorium becomes
below 1.4 
thorium can also form
with many other metals  addition of small amounts of thorium improves the mechanical strength of   and thorium- alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors  with
and uranium  it forms   and thorium is completely
in both solid and liquid
with its lighter
cerium 
isotopes  
main article 
the 4n
of 232th  commonly called the  thorium series 
although every element up to
 element 83  has an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes   classically stable    with the exceptions of
and
 elements 43 and 61   all elements from
 element 84  onward are noticeably radioactive  of these  thorium  element 90  is the most stable  closely followed by uranium  element 92   the isotope 232th has a half-life of 14.05billionyears  about three times the   and even slightly longer than the generally accepted
 about 13.8billionyears   as such  232th still occurs naturally today  four-fifths of the thorium present at earth s formation has survived to the present  thorium and uranium are thus the most well-studied of all the radioactive elements 
the heaviest three primordial nuclides  232th    and   are the only isotopes beyond bismuth that have half-lives measured in billions of years  thus  they are the only such heavy isotopes to have survived since their production around ten billion years ago  hence  thorium and uranium are the only important
radioactive elements  even then  the half-life of 232th is only a billionth that of 209bi  the last classically stable nuclide  232th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in significant quantities in nature today  and thus thorium is usually considered to be a   the reason for the existence of this  island of relative stability  at thorium and uranium  where the longest-lived isotopes have half-lives of millions or billions of years  is because the most stable isotopes of these elements have closed nuclear shells  nevertheless  since thorium and uranium have more protons than bismuth  their nuclei are thus still susceptible to
because the strong nuclear force is not strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons 
232th is the longest-lived isotope in the 4n decay chain which includes isotopes with a
divisible by 4  hence the name  it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor   the chain begins with the alpha decay of 232th to 228ra  and terminates at stable 208pb   232th very occasionally undergoes
rather than alpha decay  and has left evidence in doing so in its minerals  but the
of this process is very large at over 1021years and hence alpha decay predominates   because 232th is so long-lived  its daughters still exist in nature as
despite their much shorter half-lives  the longest among them being the 5.7-year half-life of 228ra  the immediate alpha daughter of 232th  any sample of thorium or its compounds contain traces of these daughters  which are isotopes of     bismuth  polonium      and actinium  as such  natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract its useful daughter nuclides  such as 212pb  which is used in
for  
thirty
have been characterised  which range in mass number from 209 to 238  the most stable of them  after 232th  are 230th with a half-life of 75,380years  229th with a half-life of 7,340years  228th with a half-life of 1.92years  234th with a half-life of 24.10days  and 227th with a half-life of 18.68days  all of these isotopes occur in nature as
due to their presence in the decay chains of 232th  235u  238u  and 237np  produced in minute traces in nuclear reactions in uranium ores   all of the remaining thorium isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes 
in deep
the isotope 230th becomes significant enough that the
 iupac  reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013  as it can then make up to 0.04  of natural thorium  with 232th being the remainder  the reason for this is that while its parent 238u is soluble in water  230th is insoluble and thus precipitates to form part of the sediment  and may be observed doing so  uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230th isotope  since 230th is one of the daughters of 238u  thorium thus has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition  and so an
can be given  which is 232.0377 4   thorium is one of only three significantly radioactive elements  the others being protactinium and uranium  that occur in large enough quantities on earth for this to be possible 
thorium also has three known
 or metastable states   216m1th  216m2th  and 229mth  229mth has the lowest known
of any isomer  measured to be  7.60.5 ev  this is so low that when it undergoes   the emitted gamma radiation is in the
range 
in the early history of the study of radioactivity  the different natural isotopes of thorium were given different names  in this scheme  227th was named radioactinium  rdac   228th radiothorium  rdth   230th ionium  io   231th uranium y  uy   232th thorium  th   and 234th uranium x1  ux1   this reflects that 227th and 231th occur in the decay chain of natural 235u  the actinium series   228th occurs in the decay chain of 232th  the thorium series   and that 230th occurs in the decay chain of 238u  the uranium or radium series   the remaining natural thorium isotope  229th  occurs in minute traces as part of the decay chain of 237np  the neptunium series  which is much less abundant than the other decay chains in nature and was hence discovered much later  therefore it does not have a historical name  when it was realised that all of these are isotopes of thorium  many of these names fell out of use  and  thorium  came to refer to all isotopes  not just 232th  the name ionium is still encountered for 230th in the context of  
different isotopes of thorium behave identically chemically  but have slightly differing physical properties  for example  the densities of isotopically pure 228th  229th  230th  and 232th in g cm3 are respectively expected to be 11.5  11.6  11.6  and 11.7  the isotope 229th is expected to be
with a bare
of 2839kg  although with steel reflectors this value could drop to 994kg  while 232th is not fissionable  it is
as it can be converted to fissile
using  
radiometric dating  
two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes    involving the decay of
to 230th  ionium   and ionium-thorium dating  which measures the ratio of 232th to 230th  these rely on the fact that 232th is a primordial radioisotope  but 230th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238u  uranium-thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234u and 230th relative to the age of the earth  it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of 235u into 231th  which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231pa  and this process is often used to check the results of uranium-thorium dating  uranium-thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of
materials such as
or   because while uranium is rather soluble in water  thorium and protactinium are not  and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor   from which their ratios are measured  the scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years  ionium-thorium dating is a related process  which exploits the insolubility of thorium  both 232th and 230th  and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232th to 230th  both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230th to 232th is a constant during the time period when the sediment layer was formed  that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium  and that the thorium cannot shift within the sediment layer

reactions of thorium metal
a thorium atom has 90 electrons  of which four are   three
are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy  5f  6d  and 7s  despite thorium s position in the
of the periodic table  it has an anomalous  rn 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state  as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy  even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides  thorium s 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells  because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised  such unusual behaviour is due to   which are increasingly stronger near the bottom of the periodic table  specifically the relativistic   the closeness in energy levels of the 5f  6d  and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four of its valence electrons and hence occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of  4  this behaviour is quite distinct from that of its lanthanide congener cerium  for whom  4 is the highest possible state but  3 also plays an important role and is more stable  therefore  thorium is much more similar to the
zirconium and hafnium than to its true lanthanide congener cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials  and hence also in its chemistry 
despite this anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms  however  metallic thorium atoms show significant 5f involvement  this was first realised in 1995  when it was pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the  rn 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the
should be
like the
titanium  zirconium  and hafnium  and not face-centered cubic as it actually is  indeed  the correct crystal structure can only be obtained when the 5f states are included  proving that thorium  and not protactinium  acts as the first actinide metallurgically with the clear influence of the 5f orbitals  the 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable  3 oxidation state  in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration  rn 5f1 
tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow  like those of
or lead  as the th4  ion has no 5f or 6d electrons  thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is slight enough to not pose major problems of handling and accessibility and they may be safely handled in a normal laboratory 
reactivity  
thorium is a highly
and electropositive metal  finely divided thorium metal presents a fire hazard due to its
and must therefore be handled carefully  when heated in air  thorium
ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light to produce the dioxide  in bulk  the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow  although corrosion may eventually occur after several months  most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide  which greatly accelerates corrosion  such samples slowly tarnish in air  becoming grey and finally black at the surface 
at   thorium is slowly attacked by water  but does not readily dissolve in most common acids  with the exception of   where it dissolves leaving behind a black insoluble residue  probably tho oh cl h  it dissolves in concentrated
containing a small amount of catalytic
or
ions  if these are not present 
can occur  similarly to uranium and plutonium 
inorganic compounds  
thorium dioxide has the
structure  th4      o2    
most binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may simply be prepared by heating the elements together  in air  thorium burns to form the simple dioxide  tho2  also called
or thorina  this has the
structure  thoria  a refractory material  has the highest
 3390c  of all known oxides  it is somewhat
and reacts readily with water and many gases  but dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride  when heated  it emits intense blue light through   which becomes white when mixed with its lighter homologue
 ceo2  ceria   this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles  several binary thorium
and oxychalcogenides are also known with     and  
crystal structure of thorium tetrafluoride  th4      f    
all four thorium tetrahalides are known  as are some low-valent bromides and iodides  the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water  additionally  many related polyhalide ions are also known  thorium tetrafluoride has a
crystal structure and is isotypic with
and   where the th4  ions are coordinated with f ions in somewhat distorted   the other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry  lower iodides thi3  black  and thi2  gold  can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal  these do not contain th iii  and th ii   but instead contain th4  and could be more clearly formulated as
compounds  many polynary halides with the alkali metals    thallium  and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides  chlorides  and bromides  for example  when treated with
and   th4  forms the complex anion thf2
6  which precipitates as an insoluble salt  k2thf6 
thorium borides  carbides  silicides  and nitrides are   as are those of uranium and plutonium  and have thus received attention as possible   all four heavier
       and bismuth  also form binary thorium compounds  thorium germanides are also known  thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides thh2 and th4h15  the latter of which is superconducting below the transition temperature of 7.58k  at standard temperature and pressure  it conducts electricity like a metal  they are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture 
coordination compounds  
in acidic aqueous solution  thorium occurs as the tetrapositive
 th h2o 9 4   which has   at ph 3  the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation  the th4  ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions  and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14  it is quite acidic due to its high charge  slightly stronger than   thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation  though to a lesser extent than    predominantly to  th2 oh 2 6  in solutions with ph 3 or below  but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide th oh 4 is formed and precipitates out  though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached  because the polymerisation usually slows down significantly just before the precipitation   as a   th4  favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors  complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis 
large coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size  thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11  the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10  and the borohydride  first prepared in the   has coordination number 14  the distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility  not only in water  but also in polar organic solvents 
many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known  such as the       nitrates  carbonates  phosphates      and   and their hydrated forms  they are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste  but most of them have not yet been fully characterised  especially regarding their structural properties  for example  thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid  it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds  thorium complexes with organic ligands  such as     and   are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes

the simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are th c5h5 3 and th c5h5 4  many derivatives are known  the former  which has two forms  one purple and one green  is a rare example of thorium in the formal  3 oxidation state  a formal  2 oxidation state even occurs in a derivative  the chloride derivative  th c5h5 3cl  is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with
k c5h5  used  other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used   the

formation  
232th is a primordial nuclide  having existed in its current form for over ten billion years  it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the
and scattered across the galaxy by   the letter  r  stands for  rapid neutron capture   and occurs in core-collapse supernovae  where heavy seed nuclei such as
rapidly capture neutrons  running up against the   as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can
back toward stability  neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased
that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond 56fe is endothermic  because of the abrupt loss of stability past 209bi  the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create isotopes of thorium and uranium  because all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements 
estimated abundances of the 83 primordial elements in the solar system  thorium is one of the rarest elements 
in the universe  thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements  it achieves this position not only because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process  with the other one being uranium   but also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed  the only primordial elements rarer than thorium are     tantalum  and rhenium  the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals  furthermore  neutron capture by nuclides beyond the end of the line of beta stability at a   209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption  reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become thorium  on earth  thorium is much more abundant  with an abundance of 8.1ppm in the earth s crust  it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements  almost as abundant as lead  13ppm  and significantly more abundant than tin  2.1ppm   this is because thorium  being a   is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core  on the other hand  the heavy platinum group metals have no affinity for oxygen and their oxides may even be thermodynamically unstable with respect to the elements  instead  readily dissolve in iron and sink down with it into the core  furthermore  thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water

natural thorium is essentially isotopically pure 232th  which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium  having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe  its
produces a significant amount of the   the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial nuclides  235u  238u  and 40k  the other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived  of them  only 230th is usually detectable  occurring in
with its parent 238u  and making up at most 0.04  of natural thorium 
on earth  thorium is not a rare element as was previously thought  having a crustal abundance comparable to that of lead and   twice that of arsenic  and thrice that of tin  thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals  soil normally contains about 6
 ppm  of thorium 
in nature  thorium occurs in the  4 oxidation state  together with uranium iv    iv   hafnium iv   and cerium iv   but also with scandium  yttrium  and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar   because of thorium s radioactivity  minerals containing significant quantities of thorium are often   their crystal structure having been partially or totally destroyed by the alpha radiation produced in the radioactive decay of thorium  an extreme example is    ca fe pb 2 th u si8o20  which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to thorium being an essential part of its chemical composition 
is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide  principally in         and   it contains around 2.5  thorium on average  although some deposits may contain up to 20  thorium  monazite is a chemically unreactive
mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand  its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it 
can have 0.12  thorium and
up to 0.4  thorium 
thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral   which usually contains up to 12  tho2  due to its being isotypic with   these two common actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the tho2 content  thorite  or
 thsio4   also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered  in thorium silicate minerals  the th4  and sio4
4 ions are often replaced with m3   m   sc  y  ln  and phosphate  po3
4  ions respectively  because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide  thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released in significant quantities  the th4  ion is soluble  especially in acidic soils  and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40ppm 
history  
tor s fight with the giants  1872  by   depicting an artist s perception of   the
of thunder  raising
in a battle against the  
in 1815  the swedish chemist
analysed an unusual sample of
from a copper mine in   central sweden  he noted impregnated traces of a white mineral  which he cautiously assumed to be an earth   in modern chemical nomenclature  of an unknown element   by that time  berzelius had already discovered two elements  cerium and selenium  but he had made a public mistake once  announcing a new element  gahnium  that turned out to be simply    berzelius privately named the supposed tentative element  thorium  in 1817 and its supposed oxide  thorina  after   the
of thunder  in 1824  after more deposits of the same mineral in vest-agder  norway  were discovered  he retracted his findings  as the mineral in question proved to actually be an
mineral  primarily composed of   as the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken as being a new element  the mineral was named kenotime by the french mineralogist
as a rebuke of berzelius  from the
words   vain  and   honour   this became    as a misprint from the beginning  blunting the criticism  this misspelt form was later explained as being from   stranger to  and   honour   supposedly referencing the small  rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as 
in 1828 
found a black mineral on
island 
county  norway  he was a norwegian
and amateur
who studied the minerals in telemark  where he served as   he commonly sent the most interesting specimens  such as this one  to his father    a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the   the elder esmark determined that it was not any known mineral and sent a sample to berzelius for examination  berzelius determined that it contained a new element  he published his findings in 1829  having isolated an impure sample for the first time by reducing kthf5 with
metal  berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery  thus  he named the source mineral   which has the chemical composition  th u   berzelius also made some initial characterisation of the new metal and its chemical compounds  he correctly determined that the thoriumoxygen mass ratio was 7.5  its actual value is close to that   7.3   but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent  and as such assumed that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen  120    while it is actually 15 times as large  he determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal  that he placed ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity  berzelius did not isolate the element in its metallic state  for the first time  thorium was isolated in 1914 by d  lely jr  and l  hamburger  they obtained 99  pure thorium metal by reducing thorium chloride with sodium metal  a simpler method leading to even higher purity was discovered in 1927 by marden and rentschler  involving the reduction of thorium oxide with calcium when calcium chloride was present 
in  s 1869 periodic table  thorium and the
were placed outside the main body of the table  at the end of each vertical period after the   this reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare earth metals were divalent  with the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent  mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group iv in 1871  which contained the modern
 group 14  
 group 4   cerium  and thorium  because their maximum oxidation state was  4  cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series  while thorium remained with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group  such as
and zirconium 
although thorium was discovered in 1828  it had no applications until 1885  when
invented the   a portable source of light which produces light from the
of very hot thorium oxide  heated to extremely high temperatures by burning gaseous fuels  after 1885  many applications were found for thorium and its compounds  such as in ceramics  carbon arc lamps  heat-resistant crucibles  and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid 
thorium dioxide gas mantle
in the late 19th century onward  the
underwent significant improvements  which shaped the further history of thorium  thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898  independently  by the german chemist
and later that year  the polish-french physicist   it was the second element that was found to be radioactive  after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by   between 1900 and 1903 
and
showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements  this observation led to the identification of
as one of the outcomes of the
experiments that led to their disintegration theory of   the biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903  the danger presented by radioactivity to health and environment was the reason thorium was phased out of use in applications that did not explicitly use the radioactivity  by the 1930s  it has been widely acknowledged that thorium possesses a minor threat to human organisms in large quantities 
in 1922 
published a
of the atom and its electron orbitals  which soon gathered wide acceptance  the model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements  like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals  such a second extra-long periodic table row  to accommodate known and undiscovered elements with an atomic weight greater than bismuth  thorium  protactinium  and uranium  for example   had been postulated as far back as 1892 by henry bassett  who considered thorium and uranium to be members of a second series of rare earths  and predicted that more elements would be found within this series  most investigators considered on the basis of their chemical properties that these elements were analogous to the 5d transition elements hafnium  tantalum  and tungsten  and considered the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row to be a one-off fluke  the existence of a second inner transition series  in the form of the actinides  was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established  it was only with the discovery of the first   which from plutonium onward have dominant  3 and  4 oxidation states  neptunium having  4 and  5 as dominant states and  7 as an unstable state   that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals  thus it was not until 1945  after
and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium  that seaborg realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row  instead of being the heavier congener of
and filling a fourth d-block row  today  thorium s similarities to hafnium are still sometimes acknowledged by calling it a  pseudo group-4 element  
despite thorium s radioactivity  the element has remained in use for a long time for applications not exploiting the effect as no suitable alternatives could be found  while a 1981 study estimated that a dose from using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person  this was not the case for people manufacturing the mantles  and thus contacting many  as well as soils around some factory sites  a major shift occurred as late as in the 1990s  when most of these applications that do not depend on thorium s radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements have been found  due to concerns  some manufacturers have switched to other materials  such as yttrium  although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient  other manufacturers continue to make thorium mantles  but moved their factories to   as recently as 2007  some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity  with some even fraudulently claiming them to be non-radioactive while in reality using large quantities of thorium  up to 259milligrams per mantle 
have been applied to initiate usage of thorium and its radioactivity as a power source  the earliest thorium-based reactor was made in india  the first core at the
in 1962  india has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world but does not have much uranium used elsewhere  and targeted in the 1950s at achieving energy independence for the country with their   on the other hand  in most countries  the progress staggered because uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was therefore slow  in the 20th century  3 reactors were opened in india and 12 elsewhere   large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the
 iaea  to study the use of thorium reactors  a year later  the
began their research on the matter  nuclear scientist
of
in israel  the head designer of the american first civilian
whose third core bred thorium  founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors  which included other companies 
nuclear inc  and
in the u s  and the
in russia  in the 21st century  thorium s potential for improving proliferation resistance and
characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle

thorium is extracted mostly from monazite  thorium

in another extraction method  monazite is decomposed with a 45  aqueous solution of
at 140c  mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first  filtered at 80c  washed with water and dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid  next  the acidic solution is neutralised with hydroxides to ph   5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide  th oh 4  contaminated with  3  of rare-earth hydroxides  the remaining rare-earth hydroxides remain in solution  thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements  an efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid  because the resulting solution can be purified by

since thorium has few applications today  only a few hundred tonnes of it are produced each year  mostly as a by-product of the production of uranium and the lanthanides  and even these meagre quantities exceed the current demand for thorium  half of this thorium produced is used in gas mantles  nevertheless  production could easily be increased  and probably would be if thorium became used in large quantities as nuclear fuel  present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor because of the relatively low-key exploration efforts arising out of insignificant demand 
applications  
many applications of thorium are becoming obsolete due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products  thorium is thus being phased out of many of its uses 
thorium is used in
 gtaw  to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability  in electronic equipment  thorium coating of tungsten wire improves the electron
of heated  
thorium is added to tungsten because it lowers the effective
with the result that the thoriated tungsten
emits electrons at considerably lower temperatures  this is used in thoriated tungsten elements found in the
of   e g 
found in  
many applications of thorium use  rather than the metal  its dioxide  commonly called  thoria  in the industry  the melting point of thoria is 3300c  the highest of all known oxides  only few substances have higher melting points  this means that when heated to high temperatures    it does not melt  but merely glows with an intense blue light  addition of cerium dioxide gives a bright white light  sometimes thorium nitrate is used instead  because it will thermally decompose to thoria at high temperatures  this property of thoria is used in mantles of portable gas lights  including natural gas lamps  oil lamps and camping lights  additionally  thoria is a material for
ceramics  as used in high-temperature laboratory  
yellowed thoria lens  left   a similar lens partially de-yellowed with ultraviolet radiation  centre   and lens without yellowing  right 
when added to   thoria helps increase
and decrease   such glass finds application in high-quality
for cameras and scientific instruments  the radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and degrade film  but the health risks are minimal  yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state with lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation 
thoria has been used as a chemical
in the conversion of
to nitric acid  in
and in producing  
thorium tetrafluoride is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings  it has an optical transparency in the range of 0.3512m  and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles  which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material  thorium tetrafluoride was also used in manufacturing   which provided high-intensity illumination for movie projectors and search lights

233u is fissile and hence can be used as a nuclear fuel in much the same way as the more-commonly used 235u or   when 233u undergoes nuclear fission  the neutrons emitted can strike further 232th nuclei  restarting the cycle  this closely parallels the uranium fuel cycle in
where 238u undergoes neutron capture to become 239u  beta decaying to first 239np and then fissile 239pu  the main advantage of the thorium fuel cycle is that thorium is more abundant than uranium and hence can satisfy world energy demands for longer  furthermore  232th absorbs neutrons more readily than 238u  and not only does 233u have a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture  92.0   than 235u  85.5   or 239pu  73.5    it also releases more neutrons upon fission on average  an added advantage 233u and 239pu enjoy over all other fissile nuclei  except the naturally occurring 235u  is that they can be
from neutron capture by the naturally-occurring quantity isotopes 232th and 238u  thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing
because thoria has a higher melting point  higher   and lower
than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide  uo2   thoria is also more
as  unlike uranium dioxide  it does not further oxidise to
 u3o8   furthermore  while a single neutron capture by 238u would produce transuranic waste  along with it fissile 239pu  five captures are generally necessary to do so from 232th  9899  of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either 233u or 235u  so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced  because of this  thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in
to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium 
the main disadvantage is that it is difficult and dangerous to reprocess the used fuel because many of the daughters of 232th and 233u are strong gamma emitters  additionally  all 233u production methods other than mercury fluourescence always result in significant impurities of the very dangerous gamma emitter   either from parasitic  n 2n  reactions on 232th  233pa  or 233u that result in the loss of a neutron  or from double neutron capture of 230th  an impurity in natural 232th

these impurities of 232u make 233u very easy to detect and very dangerous to work on  and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of
using 233u as the fissile material  additionally  233pa has a relatively long half-life of 27days and a high
for neutron capture  thus it is a   instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233u  a significant amount of 233pa converts to 234u and consumes neutrons  degrading   to avoid this  233pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium
during their operation  so that it only decays to 233u 
another disadvantage of the thorium fuel cycle is the need to neutron-irradiate and process natural 232th before these advantages become real  and this requires more advanced technology than the presently used fuels based on uranium and plutonium  nevertheless  advances are being made in this technology  another common criticism centres around the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle  some entities like the
go further and predict that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundancea situation which
predicts will persist  in the coming decades   furthermore  though the isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are not transuranic  some of them are still very dangerous  such as 231pa  which has a long half-life of 32760years and is a major contributor to the long term
of spent nuclear fuel 
toxicity  
radiological  
experiment on the effect of radiation  from an unburned thorium gas mantle  on the germination and growth of
seed  from   1909 
thorium is odourless and tasteless  as thorium occurs naturally  it exists in very small quantities almost everywhere on earth  the average human contains about 100 of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day of thorium  this exposure is raised for people who live near uranium  phosphate  or tin processing factories  thorium deposits  radioactive waste disposal sites  and for those who work in uranium  thorium  tin  or phosphate mining or gas mantle production industries  thorium is especially common in the
coastal areas of india  where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average  when thorium is ingested  99.98  does not remain in the body  out of the thorium that does remain in the body  three quarters of it accumulates in the   while absorption through the skin is possible  it is not a likely means of thorium exposure 
natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials  and the
emitted cannot penetrate human skin  as a result  owning and handling small amounts of thorium  such as those in a gas mantle  is considered safe  although usage of such items may pose some risks  exposure to an aerosol of thorium  such as contaminated dust  can lead to increased risk of
of the     and   as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation  exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of
diseases 
because 232th is only mildly radioactive  but decays to more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon  emitting alpha and   a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232th must include the contribution of its daughters such as 228ra  which are dangerous gamma emitters  there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles  as the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thoria  except of course 228th  which is chemically identical to its parent 232th   and they would be volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use  for example  during burning  significant fractions of the thorium daughters 224ra  228ra  212pb  and 212bi are released in the first hour of use alone  most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium  resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2 per use  about a third of the dose sustained during a   if a mantle is ingested  0.4  of the thorium and 90  of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body  some
agencies make recommendations about their use  and have raised some safety concerns regarding their
and disposal  because while the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem  that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is 
chemical  
the chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds  mostly the dioxide  are poorly soluble in water  nevertheless  some thorium compounds are chemically moderately   people who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of   it can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves 
powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric and often ignites spontaneously in air  in the 1956   the burning of thorium metal powder
led to nine injuries  some severe  as well as one death from thorium poisoning 
notes  
is very slightly radioactive  but its half-life is so long that its decay is negligible even over geological timespans 
gamma rays are distinguished by their origin in the nucleus  not their wavelength  hence there is no lower limit to gamma energy derived from radioactive decay 
 
a fissionable nuclide is capable of undergoing fission  even with a low probability  after capturing a high-energy neutron  some of these nuclides can be induced to fission with low-energy thermal neutrons with a high probability  they are referred to as fissile  a fertile nuclide is one that could be bombarded with neutrons to produce a fissile nuclide 
is a mass of a ball of a material which could undergo a sustained  
an even number of either protons or neutrons generally increases nuclear stability of isotopes  compared to isotopes with odd such numbers  for example  elements with odd atomic numbers have no more than two stable isotopes  while even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes  with tin  element 50  having the highest number of isotopes of all elements  ten  see
for more details 
other isotopes may occur alongside 232th  but only in trace quantities  if the source contains no uranium  the only other thorium isotope present would be 228th  which occurs in the
of 232th  the    the ratio of 228th to 232th would be under 1010  if uranium is present  tiny traces of several other isotopes will also be present  231th and 227th from the decay chain of 235u  the    and slightly larger but still tiny traces of 234th and 230th from the decay chain of 238u  the    229th is also been produced in the decay chain of 237np  the    while all primordial 237np is   it is still produced today as a result of nuclear reactions in uranium ores  229th is mostly produced as a
of artificial 233u  itself produced from
of 232th  due to its extreme rarity in nature 
thorianite refers to minerals with 75100mol tho2  uranothorianite  2575mol tho2  thorian uraninite  1525mol tho2    015mol tho2 
at the time  the   among which thorium was found and with which it is closely associated in the nature  were thought to be divalent  this is shown by the fact that the rare earths are there given
values two-thirds of their actual ones  and thorium and uranium are given values half of their actual ones 
the main problem of isolating thorium lies not in its chemical electropositivity  but in the close association of thorium in nature with the rare earth elements and uranium  which collectively are difficult to separate from each other    the discoverer of   had previously made an attempt to isolate thorium metal in 1882  but was unsuccessful at achieving a high degree of purity 
thorium also appears in   1864 table as the last and heaviest element  as it was initially thought that uranium was a trivalent element with an atomic weight of around 120  this is half of its actual value  since uranium is predominantly hexavalent  it also appears as the heaviest element in  s 1864 table under titanium  zirconium  and   it does not appear in   1862    1867  or  s 1870 periodic systems that exclude the rare earths and thorium 
the thirteen fissile actinide isotopes with half-lives over a year are 229th  233u  235u    239pu                and   of these  only 235u is naturally occurring  and only 233u and 239pu can be bred from naturally occurring nuclei with single neutron capture
