costbenefit analysis  cba   sometimes called benefitcost analysis  bca   is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives  for example in transactions  activities  functional business requirements   it is used to determine options that provide the best approach to achieve benefits while preserving savings  the cba is also defined as a systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and
of a decision  policy  with particular regard to   or  in general  project 
broadly  cba has two main purposes 
to determine if an investment decision is sound  justification feasibility   verifying whether its benefits outweigh the costs  and by how much 
to provide a basis for comparing projects  which involves comparing the total expected cost of each option against its total expected benefits 
cba is related to  but distinct from
analysis  in cba  benefits and costs are expressed in monetary terms  and are adjusted for the   so that all flows of benefits and flows of project costs over time  which tend to occur at different points in time  are expressed on a common basis in terms of their  
closely related  but slightly different  formal techniques include
analysis        fiscal impact analysis  and
 sroi  analysis

theory  
costbenefit analysis is often used by organizations to appraise the desirability of a given policy  it is an analysis of the expected balance of benefits and costs  including an account of foregone alternatives and the   cba helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs  and by how much relative to other alternatives  so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the costbenefit ratio  generally  accurate costbenefit analysis identifies choices that increase
from a
perspective  assuming an accurate cba  changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest costbenefit ratio can improve   while cba can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative  perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult   perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed 
process  
the following is a list of steps that comprise a generic costbenefit analysis 
list alternative projects programs 
list  
select measurement s  and measure all cost benefit elements 
predict outcome of cost and benefits over relevant time period 
convert all costs and benefits into a common currency 
apply  
calculate
of project options 
perform  
adopt recommended choice 
evaluation  
cba attempts to measure the positive or negative consequences of a project  which may include 
effects on users or participants
effects on non-users or non-participants
effects
or other social benefits 
a similar breakdown is employed in environmental analysis of   both costs and benefits can be diverse  financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data  the net benefits of a project may incorporate cost savings or public
compensation  implying the public has no legal right to the benefits of the policy  or
compensation  implying the public has a right to the benefits of the policy  for the welfare change resulting from the policy  the guiding principle of evaluating benefits is to list all  categories of  parties affected by an intervention and add the  positive or negative  value  usually monetary  that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare 
the actual compensation an individual would require to have their welfare unchanged by a policy is inexact at best  surveys   techniques  or market behavior   techniques  are often used to estimate the compensation associated with a policy  however  survey respondents often have strong incentives to misreport their true preferences and market behavior does not provide any information about important non-market welfare impacts 
one controversy is valuing a human life  e g  when assessing road safety measures or life-saving medicines  however  this can sometimes be avoided by using the related technique of cost-utility analysis  in which benefits are expressed in non-monetary units such as   for example  road safety can be measured in terms of cost per life saved  without formally placing a financial value on the life  however  such non-monetary metrics have limited usefulness for evaluating policies with substantially different outcomes  additionally  many other benefits may accrue from the policy  and metrics such as  cost per life saved  may lead to a substantially different ranking of alternatives than traditional costbenefit analysis 
another controversy is valuing the environment  which in the 21st century is typically assessed by valuing
to humans  such as air and
and   monetary values may also be assigned to other intangible effects such as business reputation  market penetration  or long-term enterprise strategy alignment  peoples willingness to pay for environmental characteristics also must involve certain nonuse values  one possibility is that although perhaps not currently in a position to experience directly a particular environmental asset  people often want to preserve the option to do so in the future  option value is the amount a person would be willing to pay to preserve the option of being able to experience a particular environmental amenity in the future  people may even be willing to pay to preserve something they in all likelihood will never seeafrican wildlife  forexample  in this case  what is involved is existence value  a willingness to pay simply to help preserve the existence of some environmental amenity  such altruistic values may be focused to some extent on future generations  in which case they might be called bequest values  last  we might add a stewardship value  which is a value not related necessarily to human use of the environment  but rather to maintaining the health of the environment for the continued use of all living organisms  one of the reasons contingent valuation studies have become more common is that questions can be phrased so as to get at these nonuse values 
time and discounting  
cba usually tries to put all relevant costs and benefits on a common temporal footing using
calculations  this is often done by converting the future expected streams of costs and benefits into a
amount using a discount rate  empirical studies and a technical framework suggest that in reality  people do discount the future like this 
the choice of discount rate is subjective  a smaller rate values future generations equally with the current generation  larger rates  e g  a market rate of return  reflects humans  attraction to valuing money that they receive today more than money they get in the future  the choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects  one issue is the   in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be  if so then arguably market rates of return should not be used to determine a discount rate  as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future  e g  climate change  
risk and uncertainty  
risk associated with project outcomes is usually handled using probability theory  this can be factored into the discount rate  to have uncertainty increasing over time   but is usually considered separately  particular consideration is often given to the preference for avoiding loss over achieving gain 
calculations do not account for the detrimental effect of uncertainty   
uncertainty in cba parameters  as opposed to risk of project failure etc   can be evaluated using a sensitivity analysis  which shows how results respond to parameter changes  alternatively a more formal risk analysis can be undertaken using  
history  
the french engineer and economist   credited with the creation of costbenefit analysis 
the concept of cba dates back to an 1848 article by
and was formalized in subsequent works by   the
initiated the use of cba in the us  after the federal navigation act of 1936 effectively required costbenefit analysis for proposed federal waterway infrastructure  the
was instrumental in establishing cba as federal policy  it demanded that  the benefits to whomever they accrue  be  in excess of the estimated costs  
public policy  
the application for broader public policy started from the work of   who in 1958 laid out a welfare economics foundation for cba and its application for
development  over the 1960s  cba was applied in the us for water quality  recreation travel  and land conservation  during this period  the concept of
was developed to represent the non-tangible value of preserving resources such as national parks 
cba was later expanded to address both intangible and tangible benefits of public policies relating to mental illness  substance abuse  college education  and chemical waste policies  in the us  the
of 1969 first required the application of cba for regulatory programs  and since then  other governments have enacted similar rules  government guidebooks for the application of cba to public policies include the canadian guide for regulatory analysis  australian guide for regulation and finance  us guide for health care programs  and us guide for emergency management programs 
transportation investment  
cba application for transport investment started in the uk  with the
project in 1960  it was later applied on many projects including  s   later  the
 nata  was introduced by the then   this presented costbenefit results and detailed
in a balanced way  nata was first applied to national road schemes in the 1998 roads review but subsequently rolled out to all transport modes  as of 2011 it was a cornerstone of transport appraisal in the uk and is maintained and developed by the department for transport 
the  s  developing harmonised european approaches for transport costing and project assessment   heatco  project  part of its   reviewed transport appraisal guidance across eu member states and found that significant differences exist between countries  heatco s aim was to develop guidelines to harmonise transport appraisal practice across the eu 
promoted the use of cba for major transport investments with the 1994 issuance of its guidebook 
in the us  both federal and state transport departments commonly apply cba  using a variety of available software tools including hers  bca net  statbencost  cal-bc  and   guides are available from the      
    and the
transportation economics committee 
cba and regulation under various us administrations  
the increased usage of cba in the us regulatory process is often associated with president  s administration  though the use of cba in us policy making dating back many decades  reagan s executive order 12291 mandated the use of cba in the regulatory process  reagan campaigned on a deregulation platform  and once he took office in 1981 quickly issued this eo  which vested the
 oira  with the authority to review agency regulations and required federal agencies to produce regulatory impact analyses when the annual impact could be estimated over  100m  shortly thereafter  in the 1980s  academic and institutional critiques of cba started to emerge  the three main criticisms were 
that cba could be used for political goals  debates on the merits of cost and benefit comparisons can be used to sidestep political or philosophical goals  rules and regulations 
that cba is inherently anti-regulatory  therefore not a neutral analysis tool  this is an ethical argument  that the monetization of policy impacts is an inappropriate tool for assessing things such as mortality risks and distributional impacts 
that the length of time necessary to complete cba can create significant delays  which can impede policy regulations 
these criticisms continued through the 1990s under the clinton administration  who furthered the anti-regulatory environment through his executive order 12866  eo 12866 changed some of reagan s language  requiring benefits to justify  rather than exceed costs  and added  reduction of discrimination or bias  as one of the benefits to be analyzed  criticisms of aspects of cba  including uncertainly valuations  discounting future values  and the calculation of risk  were used to argue that cba should play no part in the regulatory process  the use of cba in the regulatory process continues today under the obama administration  though the debate over its practical and objective value continues  some analysts oppose the use of cba in policy making  while those in favor of its use favor improvements to the analysis and calculations 
accuracy  
the value of a costbenefit analysis depends on the accuracy of the individual cost and benefit estimates  comparative studies indicate that such estimates are often flawed  preventing improvements in
and     causes of these inaccuracies include   
overreliance on data from past projects  often differing markedly in function or size and the skill levels of the team members 
use of subjective impressions in assessment
inappropriate use of heuristics to derive money cost of the intangible elements
among project supporters  looking for reasons to proceed  
interest groups may attempt to include or exclude significant costs from an analysis to influence the outcome 
in the case of the
 where  because of design flaws  the pinto was liable to burst into flames in a rear-impact collision   the company s decision was not to issue a recall  ford s costbenefit analysis had estimated that based on the number of cars in use and the probable accident rate  deaths due to the design flaw would cost it about  49.5 million to settle
lawsuits versus recall costs of  137.5 million  ford overlooked  or considered insignificant  the costs of the
that would result  which forced a recall and damaged sales 
in   some analysts think costbenefit analysis can be an inadequate measure because willingness-to-pay methods of determining the value of human life can be influenced by income level  they support use of variants such as
and
to analyze the effects of health policies 
for some environmental effects cost-benefit analysis can be substituted with   this is especially true when there is only one type of physical outcome that is sought  such as the reduction of energy use by increasing energy efficiency  using cost-effectiveness analysis is less laborious and time-consuming as it does not involve the monetization of outcomes  which can be difficult in some cases 
in environmental and occupational health regulation  it has been argued that if modern costbenefit analyses had been applied prospectively to decisions such as whether to mandate the removal of
from gasoline  block the construction of two proposed dams just above and below the
on the   and regulate workers  exposure to   these measures would not have been implemented even though they are considered to be highly successful in retrospect  the
has been cited in retrospective studies as a case where benefits exceeded costs  but the knowledge of the benefits  attributable largely to the benefits of reducing   was not available until many years later
