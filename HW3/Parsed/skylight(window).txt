providing internal illumination
daylighting is the practice of placing
or other openings and
surfaces so that during the day
provides effective internal   particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use  energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial  electric  lighting or from
heating  artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights because daylight is present  or by dimming switching electric lights automatically in response to the presence of daylight  a process known as  
daylighting is a technical term given to a common centuries-old  geography and culture independent design basic when  rediscovered  by 20th century architects  the amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring
on a grid or undertaking a
calculation  today  the use of software  such as   can allow an architect or engineer to quickly undertake complex calculations to review the benefit of a particular design 
the source of all daylight is the   the proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight  solar radiation that reaches a site without being scattered within the earths atmosphere is called direct sunlight  in contrast  light that is scattered in the atmosphere is referred to as diffused daylight  ground reflected light also contributes to the daylight  each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage  so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates  there is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall  north-facing wall in the
and south-facing wall in the   of a building from the
to the
in parts of the globe north of the
and in part of the globe south of the   traditionally  houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side but more and larger windows on the equatorial-side  south-facing wall in the northern hemisphere and north-facing wall in the southern hemisphere   equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year  except in tropical latitudes in summertime  so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows  even so  during mid-winter  light incidence is highly directional and casts deep shadows  this may be partially ameliorated through     and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces  in fairly low latitudes in summertime  windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator

types  
windows  
a conventional
windows
main article 
windows are the most common way to admit daylight into a space  their vertical orientation means that they selectively admit sunlight and diffuse daylight at different times of the day and year  therefore  windows on multiple orientations must usually be combined to produce the right mix of light for the building  depending on the climate and latitude  there are three ways to improve the amount of light available from a window   a  placing the window close to a light colored wall   b  slanting the sides of window openings so the inner opening is larger than the outer opening  or  c  using a large light colored window-sill to project light into the room 
different types and grades of glass and different window treatments can also affect the amount of light transmission through the windows  the type of glazing is an important issue  expressed by its vt coefficient  visual transmittance   also known as visual light transmittance  vlt   as the name suggests  this coefficient measures how much visible light is admitted by the window  a low vt  below 0.4  can reduce by half or more the light coming into a room  but be also aware of high vt glass  high vt numbers  say  above 0.60  can be a cause of glare  on the other hand  you should also take into account the undesirable effects of large windows 
clerestory windows  
another important element in creating daylighting is the use of
windows  these are high  vertically placed windows  they can be used to increase direct solar gain when oriented towards the equator  when facing toward the sun  clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable   in the case of a
house  clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar-side  north in the northern hemisphere  south in the southern hemisphere  rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated  alternatively  clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight  from the north in the northern hemisphere  that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office 
often  clerestory windows also shine onto interior wall surfaces painted white or another light color  these walls are placed so as to reflect indirect light to interior areas where it is needed  this method has the advantage of reducing the directionality of light to make it softer and more diffuse  reducing shadows 
skylights  
modern
main article 
skylights are light transmitting fenestration  products filling openings in a building envelope which also includes windows  doors  etc   forming all  or a portion of  the roof of a building space  skylights are widely used in daylighting design in residential and commercial buildings  mainly because they are the most effective source of daylight on a unit area basis 
an alternative to a skylight is a   a roof lantern is a daylighting
that sits above a roof  as opposed to a skylight which is fitted into a roof s construction  roof lanterns serve as both an architectural feature and a method of introducing natural light into a space  and are typically wooden or metal structures with a number of glazed glass panels 
sawtooth roof  
another roof-angled glass alternative is a
 found on older factories   sawtooth roofs have vertical roof glass facing away from the equator side of the building to capture diffused light  not harsh direct equator-side solar gain   the angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier  the sawtooth roof s lighting concept partially reduces the summer  solar furnace  skylight problem  but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior roof glass in the cold winter  with significant undesirable heat transfer 
atrium  
main article 
atrium is a large open space located within buildings  it is often used to light a central circulation or public area by daylight admitted through a glass roof or wall  atrium provides some daylight to adjacent working areas  but the amount is often small and does not penetrate very far  the main function of an
is to provide a visual experience and a degree of contact with the outside for people in the working areas  the daylighting of successive storeys of rooms adjoining an atrium is interdependent and requires a balanced approach  light from the sky can easily penetrate the upper storeys but not the lower  which rely primarily on light reflected from internal surfaces of the atrium such as floor-reflected light  the upper stories need less window area than the lower ones  and if the atrium walls are light in color the upper walls will reflect light toward the lower stories 
remote distribution  
it is possible to provide some daylight into spaces that have low possibility of windows or skylights through remote distribution devices such as   remote daylight distribution systems could be inherently inefficient and the further they have to transmit the daylight and the more convoluted the path  the greater is the inefficiency  the efficiency of many remote distribution systems can also vary dramatically from clear to overcast skies  nonetheless  where there is no other possibility of providing daylight to a space  remote distribution systems can be appreciated 
light reflectors and shelves  
light shelves
a light reflector
see also 
once used extensively in office buildings  the manually adjustable light reflector is seldom in use today having been supplanted by a combination of other methods in concert with artificial illumination  the reflector had found favor where the choices of artificial light provided poor illumination compared to modern electric lighting 
light shelves are an effective way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure  this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal light shelf outside the window  usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave  the light shelf projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to illuminate the ceiling  this reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows  reducing the need for general illumination 
in the cold winter  a natural light shelf is created when there is
on the ground which makes it reflective  low winter sun  see   reflects off the snow and increases solar gain through equator-facing glass by one- to two-thirds which brightly lights the ceiling of these rooms  glare control  drapes  may be required 
daylight redirecting window film  drf  applied to windows is relatively new alternative to   drf is applied to the upper section of a window     the principle method of light redirection is by
of light transmitted through the microscopic elements of the film  when sunlight or skylight penetrates the film  internal microscopic  louvers  redirect the incoming light upward to the ceiling  where the typical ceiling redistributes the
daylight deeper into the space  as window film does not alter the architectural nature of the building  daylight redirecting film is an elegant and easy upgrade 
light tubes  
left  diagram of a  
right  tubular daylighting devices harvest sunlight and transmit it through a highly reflective tube into an interior space at the ceiling level 
main article 
another type of device used is the light tube  also called a tubular daylighting device  tdd   which is placed into a roof and admits light to a focused area of the interior  these somewhat resemble recessed ceiling light fixtures  they do not allow as much heat transfer as skylights because they have less surface area 
tdds use modern technology to transmit visible light through opaque walls and roofs  the tube itself is a passive component consisting of either a simple reflective interior coating or a light conducting fiber optic bundle  it is frequently capped with a transparent  roof-mounted dome  light collector  and terminated with a diffuser assembly that admits the daylight into interior spaces and distributes the available light energy evenly  or else efficiently if the use of the lit space is reasonably fixed  and the user desired one or more  bright-spots   
the tubular daylighting device was invented by
in 1986 and brought to market first in australia in 1991  solatube tdd s are used to provide daylighting to residential and commercial buildings  contributing to sustainability from a lighting standpoint and reducing the carbon footprint 
fiber-optic concrete wall  
main article 
another way to make a secure structural
wall
is to embed
cables in it  daylight  and shadow images  can then pass directly through a thick solid-concrete wall 
smart glass  
main article 
smart glass is the name given to a class of materials and devices that can be switched between a transparent state and a state which is opaque  translucent  reflective  or retro-reflective  the switching is done by applying a voltage to the material  or by performing some simple mechanical operation  windows  skylights  etc   that are made of smart glass can be used to adjust indoor lighting  compensating for changes of the brightness of the light outdoors and of the required brightness indoors 
solar lighting  
the reflecting mirror of a
a
heliostats  
the use of   mirrors which are moved automatically to reflect sunlight in a constant direction as the sun moves across the sky  is gaining popularity as an energy-efficient method of lighting  a heliostat can be used to shine sunlight directly through a window or skylight  or into any arrangement of optical elements  such as light tubes  that distribute the light where it is needed  the image shows a mirror that rotates on a computer-controlled  motor-driven  
solar street lights  
raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure  the solar array of such off-grid
charges a   which powers a fluorescent or
during the night  solar street lights are   and have the advantage of savings on trenching  landscaping  and maintenance costs  as well as on the electric bills  despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting  they are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation  they are expected to dim only slightly 
hybrid solar lighting  
main article 
 ornl  has developed a new alternative to skylights called hybrid solar lighting  this design uses a roof-mounted light collector  large-diameter   and modified efficient fluorescent lighting fixtures that have transparent rods connected to the optical fiber cables  essentially no electricity is needed for daytime natural interior lighting 
field tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 of the new hsl technology were promising  but the low-volume equipment production is still expensive  hsl should become more cost effective in the near future  a version that can withstand windstorms could begin to replace conventional commercial fluorescent lighting systems with improved implementations in 2008 and beyond  the u s  2007 energy bill provides funding for hsl r d  and multiple large commercial buildings are ready to fund further hsl application development and deployment 
at night  ornl hsl uses variable-intensity fluorescent lighting electronic control ballasts  as the sunlight gradually decreases at sunset  the fluorescent fixture is gradually turned up to give a near-constant level of interior lighting from daylight until after it becomes dark outside 
hsl may soon become an option for commercial interior lighting  it can transmit about half of the direct sunlight it receives 
solarium  
main articles 
and
in a well-designed isolated solar gain building with a solarium  sunroom  greenhouse  etc   there is usually significant glass on the equator side  a large area of glass can also be added between the sun room and the interior living quarters  low-cost  high-volume-produced patio door safety glass is an inexpensive way to accomplish this goal 
the doors used to enter a room should be opposite the sun room interior glass  so that a user can see outside immediately when entering most rooms  halls should be minimized with open spaces used instead  if a hall is necessary for privacy or room isolation  inexpensive patio door safety glass can be placed on both sides of the hall  drapes over the interior glass can be used to control lighting  drapes can optionally be automated with sensor-based electric motor controls that are aware of room occupancy  daylight  interior temperature  and time of day  passive solar buildings with no central air conditioning system need control mechanisms for hourly  daily  and seasonal  temperature-and-daylight variations  if the temperature is correct  and a room is unoccupied  the drapes can automatically close to reduce heat transfer in either direction 
to help distribute sun room daylight to the sides of rooms that are farthest from the equator  inexpensive ceiling-to-floor mirrors can be used 
building codes require a second means of egress  in case of fire  most designers use a door on one side of bedrooms  and an outside window  but west-side windows provide very-poor summer thermal performance  instead of a west-facing window  designers use an r-13 foam-filled solid energy-efficient exterior door  it may have a glass storm door on the outside so that light can pass through when the inner door is opened  east west glass doors and windows should be fully shaded top-to-bottom or a spectrally selective coating can be used to reduce solar gain 
design  
architects and interior designers often use daylighting as one of design elements  good daylighting requires attention to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of design 
qualitative  
utilizing natural light is one of the design aspects in architecture  in 1929  the french architect 
said that  the history of architectural material    has been the endless struggle for light    in other words  the history of windows   as he emphasized in his architecture  such as    daylighting has been a major architectural design elements  see
and
for examples   not only the aesthetic aspects  the impact of daylighting on human health and work performance is also considered as qualitative daylighting  the current studies show that lighting conditions in workplaces contribute to a variety of factors related to work satisfaction  productivity and well-being and significantly higher visual acceptance scores under daylighting than electrical lighting  studies have also shown that light has a direct effect on human health because of the way it influences the circadian rhythms 
quantitative  
a well daylit space needs both adequate lighting levels and light that is well distributed  in the current building industry  daylighting is considered a building performance measure in green building certification programs such as   illumination engineering society  ies  and the society of light and lighting  sll  provide illuminance recommendation for each space type  how much daylighting contributes to the recommended lighting level determines daylighting performance of a building  there are two metrics that ies has approved to evaluate daylighting performance  spatial daylight autonomy sda  and annual sunlight exposure  ase   sda is a metric describing annual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels in interior environments  see daylight autonomy and leed documentation sections for more details 
evaluation method  
field measurements  
in existing buildings  field measurements can be undertaken to evaluate daylighting performance 
measurements on a grid is a basic level to derive an average illuminance of a space  the spacing of the measurement points vary with project purposes  the height of these points depends on where the primary task is performed  in most office spaces  desk level  0.762m above the floor  will be measured  based on measurements  average illuminance  maximum-to-minimum uniformity ratio  and average-to-minimum uniformity ratio will be calculated and compared to the recommended lighting level  a diagnostic survey specific to lighting can be conducted to analyse the satisfaction of building occupants 
computational simulations  
computational simulations can predict daylighting condition of a space much faster and more detailed than hand calculations or scale model testing  the simulations allow for the effects of climate with hourly weather data from   computer models are available which can predict variations in internally reflected light 
and
are methods can deal with complex geometry  allow complex sky distributions and potentially produce photorealistic images  radiosity methods assume all surfaces are perfectly diffusing to reduce computational times  ray-tracing techniques have accuracy and image rendering capacity 
autonomy  
daylight autonomy is the percentage of time that daylight levels are above a specified target
within a physical space or building  the calculation is based on annual data and the predetermined lighting levels  the goal of the calculation is to determine how long an individual can work in a space without requiring electrical lighting  while also providing optimal visual and physical comfort 
daylight autonomy is beneficial when determining how daylight enters and illuminates a space  the drawback  however  is that there is no upper limit on
levels  therefore  a space with a high internal heat gain deemed uncomfortable by occupants  would still perform well in the analysis  achieving daylight autonomy requires an
approach that guides the building form  siting  climate considerations  building components  lighting controls  and lighting design criteria 
continuous  
continuous daylight autonomy  is similar to daylight autonomy but partial credit is attributed to time steps when the daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level  for example  if the target illuminance is 400
and the calculated value is 200 lux  daylight autonomy would give zero credit  while continuous daylight autonomy would give 0.5 credit  200/400   0.5   the benefit of continuous daylight autonomy is that it does not give a hard threshold of acceptable illuminance  instead  it addresses the transition areaallowing for realistic preferences within any given space  for example  office occupants usually prefer to work at daylight below the illuminance threshold since this level avoids potential
and excessive contrast 
useful illuminance  
useful daylight illuminance focuses on the direct sunlight that falls into a space  the useful daylight illuminance calculation is based on three factorsthe percentage of time a point is below  between  or above an illuminance value  the range for these factors is typically 100-2,000 lux  useful daylight illuminance is similar to daylight autonomy but has the added benefit of addressing glare and thermal discomfort  the upper threshold is used to determine when glare or thermal discomfort is occurring and may need resolution 
leed documentation  
the
2009 daylighting standards were intended to connect building occupants with the outdoors through use of optimal daylighting techniques and technologies  according to these standards  the maximum value of 1 point can be achieved through four different approaches  the first approach is a computer simulation to demonstrate  in clear sky conditions  the daylight illuminance levels 108-5,400 lux on  september 21 between 9 00a m  and 3 00p m  another prescriptive approach is a method that uses two types of side-lighting  and three types of top-lighting to determine if a minimum of 75  daylighting is achieved in the occupied spaces  a third approach uses indoor light measurements showing that between 108-5,400 lux have been achieved in the space  the last approach is a combination of the other three calculation methods to prove that the daylight illumination requirements are achieved 
the leed 2009 documentation is based upon the
calculation  the daylight factor calculation is based on uniform overcast skies  it is most applicable in
and parts of   daylight factor is the ratio of the illuminance at a point on a plane  generally the horizontal work plane  produced by the luminous flux received directly or indirectly at that point from a sky whose luminance distribution is known  to the illuminance on a horizontal plane produced by an unobstructed hemisphere of this same sky  
leed v4 daylighting standards are the most current as of 2014  the new standards are similar to the old standards  but also intend to reinforce circadian rhythms  and reduce the use of electrical lighting by introducing daylight in the space  two options exist for achieving the maximum value of these two most recent points  one option is to use a computer simulation to demonstrate that a spatial daylight autonomy of 300 lux for at least 50  of the time  and an annual sunlight exposure of 1,000 lux for 250 occupied hours per year  exists in the space  another option is to show that illuminance levels are between 300 lux and 3,000 lux between 9 00a m  and 3 00p m  on a clear day at the equinox for 75  or 90  of the floor area in the space  the overall goal of the leed v4 daylighting metrics is to analyze both the quantity and quality of the light  as well as to balance the use of glazing to ensure more light and less cooling load
