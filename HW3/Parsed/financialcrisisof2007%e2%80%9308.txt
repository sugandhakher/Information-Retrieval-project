the financial crisis of 20072008  also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis  is considered by many economists to have been the worst
since the
of the 1930s 
the precipitating factor was a high default rate in the subprime home mortgage sector  the expansion of this sector had been encouraged by the
 cra   a us federal law first passed in 1977 and subsequently revised  which was designed to help poorer american inner-city dwellers get mortgage loans  many of these subprime  high risk  loans were then bundled and sold  finally accruing to quasi-government agencies   and    the implicit guarantee by the us federal government created a
and contributed to a glut of risky lending  many of these loans were also bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called   which could be sold on as  ostensibly  low-risk securities  because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages  and the associated risks  on in this way  they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria  encouraged by regulators   and some developed aggressive lending practices  the accumulation and subsequent default of these mortgages led to the crisis 
the crisis threatened the collapse of large financial institutions  which was prevented by the
of banks by national governments  but stock markets still dropped worldwide  in many areas  the housing market also suffered  resulting in  
and prolonged unemployment  the crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses  declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of u s  dollars  and a downturn in economic activity leading to the
of 20082012 and contributing to the   the active phase of the crisis  which manifested as a   can be dated from august 9  2007  when

borrowers  overvaluation of bundled
mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate  questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers  compensation structures that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation  and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making  questions regarding bank   declines in credit availability and damaged investor confidence affected global   where securities suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009  economies worldwide slowed during this period  as credit tightened and international trade declined  governments and

regulatory reforms were enacted in the u s  to lessen the chance of a recurrence  and the

background  
main article 
the immediate cause or trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the u s a   united states of america    which peaked in 2004  already-rising default rates on    and
 arm  began to increase quickly thereafter  as banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners  housing prices began to rise 
easy availability of credit in the u s   fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the
and
of the 19971998 period  led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debt-financed consumer spending  lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the   loans of various types  e g   mortgage  credit card  and auto  were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load 
as part of the housing and credit booms  the number of financial agreements called
 mbs  and
 cdo   which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices  greatly increased  such
enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the u s  housing market  as housing prices declined  major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime mbs reported significant losses 
falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan  providing a financial incentive to enter     the ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the u s  and only reduced to historical levels in early 2014 drained significant wealth from consumers  losing up to  4.2 trillion in wealth from   defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy  total losses are estimated in the trillions of u s  dollars globally 
share in gdp of u s  financial sector since 1860
while the housing and credit bubbles were building  a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile  a process called   u s  government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized
to encourage business  which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions  thus  policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and   also known as the   some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial  depository  banks in providing credit to the u s  economy  but they were not subject to the same regulations 
these institutions  as well as certain regulated banks  had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or mbs losses  these losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend  slowing economic activity  concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the
markets  which are integral to funding business operations  governments also
key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs  assuming significant additional financial commitments 
the u s 
reported its findings in january 2011  it concluded that  the crisis was avoidable and was caused by  widespread failures in financial regulation  including the federal reserves failure to stem the tide of   dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk  an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and wall street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis  key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis  lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw  and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels  
subprime lending  
main article 
during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share  and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited  mortgage lenders relaxed
standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers  in the view of some analysts  the relatively conservative
 gses  policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003  however  as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power  mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated  the worst loans were originated in 20042007  the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses 
u s  subprime lending expanded dramatically 20042006
as well as easy credit conditions  there is evidence that competitive pressures contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis  major u s  investment banks and gses like
played an important role in the expansion of lending  with gses eventually relaxing their standards to try to catch up with the private banks 
a contrarian view is that fannie mae and
led the way to relaxed underwriting standards  starting in 1995  by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems  by designing the no-downpayment products issued by lenders  by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers  and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as  
depending on how subprime mortgages are defined  they remained below 10  of all mortgage originations until 2004  when they spiked to nearly 20  and remained there through the 20052006 peak of the  
the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission  written by the six democratic appointees  the minority report  written by 3 of the 4 republican appointees  studies by federal reserve economists  and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis  although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis  they contend that gse loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks  and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios 
in his dissent to the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission 
stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the u s  department of housing and urban development  hud  in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities
and   later  based upon information in the sec s december 2011 securities fraud case against 6 ex-executives of fannie and freddie  peter wallison and edward pinto estimated that  in 2008  fannie and freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over  2 trillion 
in the early and mid-2000s  the bush administration called numerous times for investigation into the safety and soundness of the gses and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages  on september 10  2003  the house financial services committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the
 ofheo  that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities  the hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of fannie mae and freddie mac  as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked ofheo for their attempt at regulation  some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the u s  financial system that went unheeded 
a 2000
study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that  467billion of mortgage lending was made by
 cra -covered lenders into low and mid level income  lmi  borrowers and neighborhoods  representing 10  of all u s  mortgage lending during the period  the majority of these were prime loans  sub-prime loans made by cra-covered institutions constituted a 3  market share of lmi loans in 1998  but in the run-up to the crisis  fully 25  of all sub-prime lending occurred at cra-covered institutions and another 25  of sub-prime loans had some connection with cra  furthermore  most sub-prime loans were not made to the lmi borrowers targeted by the cra  especially in the years 20052006 leading up to the crisis  nor did it find any evidence that lending under the cra rules increased delinquency rates or that the cra indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending 
to other analysts the delay between cra rule changes  in 1995  and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising  and does not exonerate the cra  they contend that there were two  connected causes to the crisis  the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the federal reserve after the terrorist attack on september 11  2001  both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place  critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive  totaling  4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007  they also argue that the federal reserves classification of cra loans as prime is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans  3 percentage points over average  equal subprime loans 
others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude  in an article in portfolio magazine 
spoke with one trader who noted that  there werent enough americans with  bad  credit taking out  bad loans  to satisfy investors  appetite for the end product   essentially  investment banks and
used
to enable large wagers to be made  far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans  using
called  
and  
as of march 2011 the fdic has had to pay out  9 billion to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions  the congressional budget office estimated  in june 2011  that the bailout to fannie mae and freddie mac exceeds  300 billion  calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time  
economist
argued in january 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that     cra  or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis  in other words  bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes 
countering krugman  peter j  wallison wrote   it is not true that every bubbleeven a large bubblehas the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates   wallison notes that other developed countries had  large bubbles during the 19972007 period  but  the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the 19972007  bubble  deflated   according to wallison  the reason the u s  residential housing bubble  as opposed to other types of bubbles  led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans  generally with low or no downpayments 
krugman s contention  that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that u s  housing policy was not the cause of the crisis  is challenged by additional analysis  after researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis  xudong an and anthony b  sanders reported  in december 2010    we find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in cmbs  commercial mortgage-backed securities  loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis   other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate  business journalist kimberly amadeo reports   the first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006  three years later  commercial real estate started feeling the effects  denice a  gierach  a real estate attorney and cpa  wrote 
   most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy  in other words  the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad  it was the economy 
growth of the housing bubble  
main article 
a graph showing the median and average sales prices of new homes sold in the united states between 1963 and 2008  not adjusted for inflation 
between 1998 and 2006  the price of the typical american house increased by 124   during the two decades ending in 2001  the national median home price ranged from 2.9 to 3.1 times median household income  this ratio rose to 4.0 in 2004  and 4.6 in 2006  this
resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates  or financing consumer spending by taking out
secured by the price appreciation 
in a
winning program 
correspondents argued that a  giant pool of money   represented by  70trillion in worldwide fixed income investments  sought higher yields than those offered by u s  treasury bonds early in the decade  this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007  yet the supply of relatively safe  income generating investments had not grown as fast  investment banks on wall street answered this demand with products such as the
and the
that were assigned safe
by the  
in effect  wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the u s   with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage   from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them  by approximately 2003  the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted  and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards 
the collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending  extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees  this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority  those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies  securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested 
by september 2008  average u s  housing prices had declined by over 20  from their mid-2006 peak  as prices declined  borrowers with
could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default  during 2007  lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3million properties  a 79  increase over 2006  this increased to 2.3million in 2008  an 81  increase vs  2007  by august 2008  9.2  of all u s  mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure  by september 2009  this had risen to 14.4  
easy credit conditions  
lower interest rates encouraged borrowing  from 2000 to 2003  the
lowered the
target from 6.5  to 1.0   this was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the
and the   as well as to combat a perceived risk of   as early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the fed  needs to create a housing bubble to replace the nasdaq bubble   moreover  empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis 
u s  current account deficit 
additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by the high and rising u s 
deficit  which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006  federal reserve chairman
explained how trade deficits required the u s  to borrow money from abroad  in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates 
bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004  the u s  current account deficit increased by  650billion  from 1.5  to 5.8  of gdp  financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad  much of it from countries running trade surpluses  these were mainly the emerging economies in asia and oil-exporting nations  the
requires that a country  such as the u s   running a
deficit also have a
 investment  surplus of the same amount  hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds  capital  flowed into the u s  to finance its imports 
all of this created demand for various types of financial assets  raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates  foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates  as high as 40  in china  or because of high oil prices  ben bernanke has referred to this as a    
a flood of funds   or   reached the u s  financial markets  foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing
and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis  u s  households  on the other hand  used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets  financial institutions invested foreign funds in  
the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july 2004 and july 2006  this contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year
 arm  rates  making arm interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners  this may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble  as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates  and it became riskier to speculate in housing  u s  housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst 
weak and fraudulent underwriting practices  
testimony given to the
by richard m  bowen iii on events during his tenure as the business chief underwriter for correspondent lending in the consumer lending group for
 where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters  suggests that by the final years of the u s  housing bubble  20062007   the collapse of
standards was endemic  his testimony stated that by 2006  60  of mortgages purchased by
from some 1,600 mortgage companies were  defective   were not underwritten to policy  or did not contain all policy-required documents   this  despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible  certified via representations and warrantees  that its mortgage originations met
standards  moreover  during 2007   defective mortgages  from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to
standards  increased    to over 80  of production  
in separate testimony to financial crisis inquiry commission  officers of clayton holdingsthe largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the united states and europetestified that clayton s review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from january 2006 to june 2007 revealed that scarcely 54  of the loans met their originators underwriting standards  the analysis  conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks  including 7    banks  additionally showed that 28  of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer  clayton s analysis further showed that 39  of these loans  i e  those not meeting any issuer s minimal underwriting standards  were subsequently securitized and sold to investors 
there is strong evidence that the gses  due to their large size and market power  were far more effective at policing underwriting by originators and forcing underwriters to repurchase defective loans  by contrast  private securitizers have been far less aggressive and less effective in recovering losses from originators on behalf of investors 
predatory lending  
predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders  enticing borrowers to enter into  unsafe  or  unsound  secured loans for inappropriate purposes  a classic
method was used by   advertising low interest rates for home refinancing  such loans were written into extensively detailed contracts  and swapped for more expensive loan products on the day of closing  whereas the advertisement might state that 1  or 1.5  interest would be charged  the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage  arm  in which the interest charged would be greater than the amount of interest paid  this created   which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated 
countrywide  sued by
jerry brown for  unfair business practices  and  false advertising  was making high cost mortgages  to homeowners with weak credit  adjustable rate mortgages  arms  that allowed homeowners to make interest-only payments   when housing prices decreased  homeowners in arms then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments  since their home equity had disappeared  this caused countrywide s financial condition to deteriorate  ultimately resulting in a decision by the
to seize the lender 
former employees from   which was united states  leading wholesale lender  described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to wall street banks eager to make fast profits  there is growing evidence that such
may be a cause of the crisis 
deregulation  
further information 
a 2012 oecd study suggest that bank regulation based on the basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis  in other cases  laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system  key examples include 
 s
of 1980  didmca  phased out a number of restrictions on banks  financial practices  broadened their lending powers  allowed
and
to offer   and raised the
limit from  40,000 to  100,000  thereby potentially lessening depositor scrutiny of lenders  risk management policies  
in october 1982  u s  president ronald reagan signed into law the   which provided for   began the process of banking deregulation  and contributed to the
of the late 1980s early 1990s 
in november 1999  u s  president bill clinton signed into law the   which repealed provisions of the glass-steagall act that prohibit a
from owning other financial companies  the repeal effectively removed the separation that previously existed between wall street investment banks and depository banks  most analysts say that this repeal directly contributed to the severity of the   however  there is perspective that repeal made little difference because the institutions that were greatly affected did not fall under the jurisdiction of the act itself 
in 2004  the u s 
relaxed the   which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on  fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages  the sec has conceded that self-regulation of investment banks contributed to the crisis 
financial institutions in the
are not subject to the same regulation as depository banks  allowing them to assume additional debt obligations relative to their financial cushion or capital base  this was the case despite the
debacle in 1998  where a highly leveraged shadow institution failed with systemic implications 
regulators and accounting standard-setters allowed depository banks such as
to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities off-balance sheet into complex legal entities called   masking the weakness of the capital base of the firm or degree of
or risk taken  one news agency estimated that the top four u s  banks will have to return between  500billion and  1trillion to their balance sheets during 2009  this increased uncertainty during the crisis regarding the financial position of the major banks  off-balance sheet entities were also used by
as part of the scandal that brought down that company in 2001 
as early as 1997  federal reserve chairman
fought to keep the derivatives market unregulated  with the advice of the   the u s  congress and president bill clinton allowed the self-regulation of the
derivatives market when they enacted the   derivatives such as
 cds  can be used to hedge or speculate against particular credit risks without necessarily owning the underlying debt instruments  the volume of cds outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008  with estimates of the debt covered by cds contracts  as of november 2008  ranging from us 33 to  47trillion  total over-the-counter  otc  derivative
rose to  683trillion by june 2008 
famously referred to derivatives as  financial weapons of mass destruction  in early 2003 
increased debt burden or overleveraging  
leverage ratios of investment banks increased significantly between 2003 and 2007 
prior to the crisis  financial institutions became highly leveraged  increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses  much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives  which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels  these instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy  and contributed to the need for government bailouts 
relative to disposable income and gdp 
u s  households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or
during the years preceding the crisis  this increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn  key statistics include 
free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from  627billion in 2001 to  1,428billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built  a total of nearly  5trillion over the period  contributing to economic growth worldwide  u s  home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46  during the 1990s to 73  during 2008  reaching  10.5trillion 
usa household debt as a percentage of annual
was 127  at the end of 2007  versus 77  in 1990  in 1981  u s  private debt was 123  of gdp  by the third quarter of 2008  it was 290  
from 2004 to 2007  the top five u s  investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage  see diagram   which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock  changes in capital requirements  intended to keep u s  banks competitive with their european counterparts  allowed lower risk weightings for aaa securities  the shift from first-loss
to aaa tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage  these five institutions reported over  4.1trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007  about 30  of usa nominal gdp for 2007 
 
and
were sold at fire-sale prices  and
and
became commercial banks  subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation  with the exception of lehman  these companies required or received government support  lehman reported that it had been in talks with bank of america and barclays for the company s possible sale  however  both barclays and bank of america ultimately declined to purchase the entire company 
and   two u s    owned or guaranteed nearly  5trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into
by the u s  government in september 2008 
these seven entities were highly leveraged and had  9trillion in debt or guarantee obligations  yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks 
behavior that may be optimal for an individual  e g   saving more during adverse economic conditions  can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior  as ultimately one person s consumption is another person s income  too many consumers attempting to save  or pay down debt  simultaneously is called the
and can cause or deepen a recession  economist
also described a  paradox of deleveraging  as financial institutions that have too much leverage  debt relative to equity  cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets 
during april 2009  u s  federal reserve vice-chair
discussed these paradoxes   once this
hit  it didnt take long before we were in a recession  the recession  in turn  deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell  and credit losses of financial institutions surged  indeed  we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year  a process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy  consumers are pulling back on purchases  especially on durable goods  to build their savings  businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash  and  financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm  once again  minsky understood this dynamic  he spoke of the paradox of deleveraging  in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firmsand indeed essential to return the economy to a normal statenevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole  
financial innovation and complexity  
imf diagram of cdo and rmbs
the term
refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives  such as offsetting a particular risk exposure  such as the default of a borrower  or to assist with obtaining financing  examples pertinent to this crisis included  the   the bundling of subprime mortgages into
 mbs  or
 cdo  for sale to investors  a type of   and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps  cds   the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis  these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions 
cdo issuance grew from an estimated  20 billion in q1 2004 to its peak of over  180 billion by q1 2007  then declined back under  20 billion by q1 2008  further  the credit quality of cdo s declined from 2000 to 2007  as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5  to 36  of cdo assets  as described in the section on subprime lending  the cds and portfolio of cds called
enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding  provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found  for example  buying a cds to insure a cdo ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the cdo  when those cdo s became worthless

this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity  it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage  including mortgage brokers  specialized originators  the securitizers and their due diligence firms  managing agents and trading desks  and finally investors  insurances and providers of repo funding   with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information  including fico scores on creditworthiness  appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations  and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks   instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts  misjudgments and finally market collapse 
further wrote in june 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations  such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks  stating      an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade  the off-balance-sheet vehicles  the derivatives and the  shadow banking system  itself  was to find a way round regulation  
incorrect pricing of risk  
a protester on
in the wake of the
is interviewed by news media 
the pricing of risk refers to the
required by investors for taking on additional risk  which may be measured by interest rates or fees  several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks  risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis  enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have  and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward  readily understandable format 
for a variety of reasons  market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system  for example  the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system  banks estimated that  450bn of cdo were sold between  late 2005 to the middle of 2007   among the  102bn of those that had been liquidated  jpmorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for  high quality  cdos was approximately 32cents on the dollar  while the recovery rate for
cdo was approximately five cents for every dollar 
another example relates to   which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps  the basic cds transaction involved aig receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party a in the event party b defaulted  however  aig did not have the financial strength to support its many cds commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in september 2008  u s  taxpayers provided over  180billion in government support to aig during 2008 and early 2009  through which the money flowed to various counterparties to cds transactions  including many large global financial institutions 
the
 fcic  made the major government study of the crisis  it concluded in january 2011 
the commission concludes aig failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral  setting aside capital reserves  or hedging its exposure  a profound failure in corporate governance  particularly its risk management practices  aig s failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter  otc  derivatives  including credit default swaps  which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products  including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of aig s failure 
the limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood  this formula assumed that the price of cds was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage-backed securities  because it was highly tractable  it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of cdo and cds investors  issuers  and rating agencies  according to one wired com article 
then the model fell apart  cracks started appearing early on  when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of li s formula hadn t expected  the cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008when ruptures in the financial system s foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril    li s
formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees 
as financial assets became more and more complex  and harder and harder to value  investors were reassured by the fact that both the international
agencies and bank regulators  who came to rely on them  accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be 
commented that  the super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves  similarly  the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products  it was a shocking abdication of responsibility  
moreover  a conflict of interest between
and their   combined with a global glut in investment capital  led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets  professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client   there is  therefore  an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation  as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline  asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients  many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced  under-yielding  investments  to the detriment of their clients  in order to maintain their assets under management  this choice was supported by a  plausible deniability  of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early  vintages  of subprime loans was so low 
despite the dominance of the above formula  there are documented attempts of the financial industry  occurring before the crisis  to address the formula limitations  specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events  the volume  credit correlation  life after copulas   published in 2007 by world scientific  summarizes a 2006 conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations  see also the article by donnelly and embrechts and the book by brigo  pallavicini and torresetti  that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in 2006 
mortgage risks were underestimated by every institution in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years  limitations of default and prepayment models  the heart of pricing models  led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators  securitizers  broker-dealers  rating-agencies  insurance underwriters and investors 
boom and collapse of the shadow banking system  
securitization markets were impaired during the crisis
there is strong evidence that the riskiest  worst performing mortgages were funded through the  shadow banking system  and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their own underwriting standards and originate riskier loans 
in a june 2008 speech  president and ceo of the new york federal reserve bank who in 2009 became secretary of the united states treasuryplaced significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a  run  on the entities in the  parallel  banking system  also called the   these entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system  but were not subject to the same regulatory controls  further  these entities were vulnerable because of   meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term  illiquid and risky assets  this meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging  selling their long-term assets at depressed prices  he described the significance of these entities 
in early 2007  asset-backed commercial paper conduits  in structured investment vehicles  in auction-rate preferred securities  tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes  had a combined asset size of roughly  2.2trillion  assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to  2.5trillion  assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly  1.8trillion  the combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled  4trillion  in comparison  the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the united states at that point were just over  6trillion  and total assets of the entire banking system were about  10trillion  the combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles 
  laureate of the   described the run on the shadow banking system as the  core of what happened  to cause the crisis  he referred to this lack of controls as  malign neglect  and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity 
the securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008  more than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds  according to the   the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009   it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume   the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are  likely to vanish forever  having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions  
commodities boom  
main article 
rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble  the price of oil nearly tripled from  50 to  147 from early 2007 to 2008  before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008  experts debate the causes  with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities  some to monetary policy  and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world  leading to long positions taken on those markets  such as chinese increasing presence in africa  an increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline  which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries  as wealth flows to oil-producing states  a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified  the destabilizing effects of this price variance has been proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis 
global copper prices
copper prices increased at the same time as the oil prices  copper traded at about  2,500 per ton from 1990 until 1999  when it fell to about  1,600  the price slump lasted until 2004 which saw a price surge that had copper reaching  7,040 per ton in 2008 
nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s  then the price of nickel declined from around  51,000  36,700 per metric ton in may 2007 to about  11,550 8,300 per metric ton in january 2009  prices were only just starting to recover as of january 2010  but most of australia s nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then  as the price for high grade
ore recovered in 2010  so did the australian nickel mining industry 
coincidentally with these price fluctuations  long-only commodity index funds became popular  by one estimate investment increased from  90billion in 2006 to  200billion at the end of 2007  while commodity prices increased 71   which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble  the empirical research has been mixed 
systemic crisis  
another analysis  different from the
explanation  is that the financial crisis is merely a symptom of another  deeper crisis  which is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself 
 s theory is that growing inequality of
produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major   he has also suggested that a  demand gap  related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments 
  a political economy analyst and editor of the   believes that the decrease in gdp growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing  
wrote during 2005 that a series of unresolved challenges face capitalism that have contributed to past financial crises and have not been sufficiently addressed 
corporate america went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long    they failed to  keep an eye on these geniuses  to whom they had entrusted the responsibility of the management of america s great corporations 
echoing the central thesis of
1941 seminal book    bogle cites particular issues  including 
that  manager s capitalism  has replaced  owner s capitalism   meaning management runs the firm for its benefit rather than for the shareholders  a variation on the  
the burgeoning executive compensation 
the management of earnings  mainly a focus on share price rather than the creation of genuine value  and
the failure of gatekeepers  including auditors  boards of directors  wall street analysts  and career politicians 
an analysis conducted by   a former executive at the swiss-based
bank  suggested that large-scale momentum  or
 played a pivotal role  in the 200809 global financial crisis  roeder suggested that  recent technological advances  such as computer-driven trading programs  together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets  has magnified the momentum effect  this has made the financial sector inherently unstable  
has attributed the current economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the united states  particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80  of the workforce  his claim is that this stagnation forced the population to borrow in order to meet the cost of living 
feminist economists
and
argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession  and call for a reshaping of both the economy  economic theory and the economics profession  they argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within
and that take as their starting point the socially responsible  sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet 
role of economic forecasting  
the former governor of the
had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the  in 2005  at a celebration honouring   who was about to retire as chairman of the   rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector  in that paper   has financial development made the world riskier    rajan  argued that disaster might loom   rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to  take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but  in return  offer generous compensation the rest of the time  these risks are known as tail risks  but perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise  financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised

a cover story in
magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the
of the 1930s  the  s online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis  popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis  for example  an article in the new york times informs that economist
warned of such crisis as early as september 2006  and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions  according to   roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession  while the new york times labelled him  dr  doom  
shiller  an expert in   wrote an article a year before the collapse of lehman brothers in which he predicted that a slowing u s  housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst  leading to financial collapse  schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse 
within mainstream   most believe that financial crises are simply unpredictable  following eugene fama s
and the related   which state respectively that markets contain all information about possible future movements  and that the movements of financial prices are random and unpredictable  recent research casts doubt on the accuracy of  early warning  systems of potential crises  which must also predict their timing 
stock trader and financial risk engineer   author of the 2007 book   spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of bad risk models and reliance on forecasting  and their reliance on bad models  and framed the problem as part of  robustness and fragility   he also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis   they didn t listen  so i took their money    according to david brooks from the new york times   taleb not only has an explanation for whats happening  he saw it coming

the first notable event signaling a possible financial crisis occurred in the united kingdom on august 9  2007  when   citing  a complete evaporation of liquidity   blocked withdrawals from three hedge funds  the significance of this event was not immediately recognized but soon led to a panic as investors and savers attempted to liquidate assets deposited in highly leveraged financial institutions

indymac  
the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern californiabased   a spin-off of   before its failure  indymac bank was the largest
in the
market and the seventh largest
originator in the united states  the failure of indymac bank on july 11  2008  was the fourth largest
in
history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures  and the second largest failure of a regulated   indymac bank s parent corporation was indymac bancorp until the fdic seized indymac bank  indymac bancorp filed for
in july 2008 
indymac bank was founded as countrywide mortgage investment in 1985 by
and
as a means of
loans too big to be sold to
and   in 1997  countrywide spun off indymac as an independent company run by mike perry  who remained its ceo until the downfall of the bank in july 2008 
the primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing
loans on a large scale  this strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets  from its inception as a savings association in 2000  indymac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the united states  during 2006  indymac originated over  90 billion of mortgages 
indymacs aggressive growth strategy  use of alt-a and other nontraditional loan products  insufficient underwriting  credit concentrations in residential real estate in the
and
marketsstates  alongside nevada and arizona  where the
was most pronouncedand heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a
 fhlb  and from brokered deposits  led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007 
indymac often made loans without verification of the borrowers income or assets  and to borrowers with poor credit histories  appraisals obtained by indymac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well  as an alt-a lender  indymacs business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrowers needs  using an extensive array of risky option-  option arms   subprime loans  80/20 loans  and other nontraditional products  ultimately  loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments  the thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the   indymac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria  see the comment by ruthann melbourne  chief risk officer  to the regulating agencies 
may 12  2008  in a small note in the  capital  section of its what would become its last
released before receivership  indymac revealed  but did not admit  that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency 
indymac reported that during april 2008 
and
downgraded the ratings on a significant number of
 mbs  bonds including  160 million of those issued by indymac and which the bank retained in its mbs portfolio  indymac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the company s risk-based capital ratio as of june 30  2008  had these lowered ratings been in effect at march 31  2008  indymac concluded that the bank s capital ratio would have been 9.27  total risk-based  indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below  well capitalized   minimum 10  risk-based capital ratio  to  adequately capitalized   810  risk-based capital ratio  the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds 
senator
 d-ny  would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of indymac s total deposits and ask the
 fdic  whether it had considered ordering indymac to reduce its reliance on these deposits  with  18.9 billion in total deposits reported on march 31  senator schumer would have been referring to a little over  7 billion in brokered deposits  while the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly  a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to indymac at  500 million a month  had the regulator disallowed indymac from acquiring new brokered deposits on june 30 
indymac was taking new measures to preserve capital  such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities  dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008  after being cut in half the previous quarter  the company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer 
indymac reported that the bank s risk-based capital was only  47 million above the minimum required for this 10  mark  but it did not reveal some of that  47 million capital it claimed it had  as of march 31  2008  was fabricated

wealth effects  
the new york city headquarters of lehman brothers
there is a direct relationship between declines in wealth and declines in consumption and business investment  which along with government spending  represent the economic engine  between june 2007 and november 2008  americans lost an estimated average of more than a quarter of their collective net worth    by early november 2008  a broad u s  stock index the s p 500  was down 45  from its 2007 high  housing prices had dropped 20  from their 2006 peak  with futures markets signaling a 3035  potential drop  total home equity in the united states  which was valued at  13trillion at its peak in 2006  had dropped to  8.8trillion by mid-2008 and was still falling in late 2008  total retirement assets  americans  second-largest household asset  dropped by 22   from  10.3trillion in 2006 to  8trillion in mid-2008  during the same period  savings and investment assets  apart from retirement savings  lost  1.2trillion and pension assets lost  1.3trillion  taken together  these losses total a staggering  8.3trillion  since peaking in the second quarter of 2007  household wealth is down 14trillion 
further  u s  homeowners had extracted significant equity in their homes in the years leading up to the crisis  which they could no longer do once housing prices collapsed  free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from  627billion in 2001 to  1,428billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built  a total of nearly  5trillion over the period  u s  home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46  during the 1990s to 73  during 2008  reaching  10.5trillion 
to offset this decline in consumption and lending capacity  the u s  government and u s  federal reserve have committed  13.9trillion  of which  6.8trillion has been invested or spent  as of june 2009  in effect  the fed has gone from being the    to the  lender of only resort  for a significant portion of the economy  in some cases the fed can now be considered the  buyer of last resort

observed   there is a really good reason for tighter credit  tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today  businesses are facing the worst downturn since the   this matters for credit decisions  a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt  they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and or have a default placed on their credit record  on the other hand  a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk  in the case of businesses  their creditworthiness depends on their future profits  profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007    while many banks are obviously at the brink  consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid  the problem with the economy is the loss of close to  6trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth 
at the heart of the portfolios of many of these institutions were investments whose assets had been derived from bundled home mortgages  exposure to these mortgage-backed securities  or to the
used to insure them against failure  caused the collapse or takeover of several key firms such as       and  
european contagion  
the crisis rapidly developed and spread into a global economic shock  resulting in a number of european   declines in various stock indexes  and large reductions in the market value of equities and  
both mbs and cdo were purchased by corporate and institutional investors globally  derivatives such as
also increased the linkage between large financial institutions  moreover  the
of financial institutions  as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets  further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade 
world political leaders  national ministers of finance and central bank directors coordinated their efforts to reduce fears  but the crisis continued  at the end of october 2008 a
developed  with investors transferring vast capital resources into stronger currencies such as the yen  the dollar and the   leading many emergent economies to seek aid from the  
effects on the global economy  as of 2009   
main article 
global effects  
several commentators have suggested that if the liquidity crisis continues  an extended
or worse could occur  the continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global
although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative  the financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking shakeout since the savings-and-loan meltdown  investment bank
stated on october 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession  with recovery unlikely for at least two years  three days later ubs economists announced that the  beginning of the end  of the crisis had begun  with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis 
injection by governments  injection made systemically  interest rate cuts to help borrowers  the united kingdom had started systemic injection  and the world s central banks were now cutting interest rates  ubs emphasized the united states needed to implement systemic injection  ubs further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis  but that in economic terms  the worst is still to come   ubs quantified their expected recession durations on october 16  the eurozone s would last two quarters  the united states  would last three quarters  and the united kingdom s would last four quarters  the
involved all three of the country s major banks  relative to the size of its economy  icelands banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history 
at the end of october ubs revised its outlook downwards  the forthcoming recession would be the worst since the
with negative 2009 growth for the u s   eurozone  uk  very limited recovery in 2010  but not as bad as the  
the
reported in june 2009 that u s  consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007   the us economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the u s  consumer as a source of global demand   with a recession in the u s  and the increased savings rate of u s  consumers  declines in growth elsewhere have been dramatic  for the first quarter of 2009  the annualized rate of decline in gdp was 14.4  in germany  15.2  in japan  7.4  in the uk  18  in latvia  9.8  in the euro area and 21.5  for mexico 
some
that had seen strong economic growth saw significant slowdowns  for example  growth forecasts in cambodia show a fall from more than 10  in 2007 to close to zero in 2009  and kenya may achieve only 34  growth in 2009  down from 7  in 2007  according to the research by the   reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade  commodity prices  investment and
sent from migrant workers  which reached a record  251billion in 2007  but have fallen in many countries since   this has stark implications and has led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line  be it 300,000 in bangladesh or 230,000 in ghana  especially states with a fragile political system have to fear that investors from western states withdraw their money because of the crisis  bruno wenn of the german deg recommends to provide a sound economic policymaking and good governance to attract new investors
the world bank reported in february 2009 that the arab world was far less severely affected by the credit crunch  with generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits  such as remittances  foreign direct investment  fdi  or foreign aid  arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008  this group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks  they entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions  this gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn  the greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices  which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance  steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments  significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks  initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers 
u s  economic effects  
real gross domestic product  
the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the united statesdecreased at an annual rate of approximately 6  in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009  versus activity in the year-ago periods  the u s  unemployment rate increased to 10.1  by october 2009  the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate  the average hours per work week declined to 33  the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964  with the decline of gross domestic product came the decline in innovation  with fewer resources to risk in creative destruction  the number of patent applications flat-lined  compared to the previous 5 years of exponential increases in patent application  this stagnation correlates to the similar drop in gdp during the same time period 
distribution of wealth in the us  
u s  inequality from 1913 to 2008 
typical american families did not fare as well  nor did those  wealthy-but-not wealthiest  families just beneath the pyramid s top  on the other hand  half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis  the federal reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009  and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all americans declined in that period  77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth  while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease 
official economic projections  
on november 3  2008  the european commission at
predicted for 2009 an extremely weak growth of gdp  by 0.1   for the countries of the
 france  germany  italy  belgium etc   and even negative number for the uk  1.0    ireland and spain  on november 6  the imf at washington  d c   launched numbers predicting a worldwide recession by 0.3  for 2009  averaged over the developed economies  on the same day  the bank of england and the   respectively  reduced their interest rates from 4.5  down to 3   and from 3.75  down to 3.25   as a consequence  starting from november 2008  several countries launched large  help packages  for their economies 
the u s  federal reserve open market committee release in june 2009 stated 
   the pace of economic contraction is slowing  conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months  household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses  lower housing wealth  and tight credit  businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales  although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time  the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions  fiscal and monetary stimulus  and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability  economic projections from the federal reserve and reserve bank presidents include a return to typical growth levels  gdp  of 2.53  in 2010  an unemployment plateau in 2009 and 2010 around 10  with moderation in 2011  and inflation that remains at typical levels around 12  
government responses  
emergency and short-term responses  
main article 
the u s  federal reserve and central banks around the world took steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a   in which lower wages and higher unemployment lead to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption  in addition  governments enacted large fiscal stimulus packages  by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis  the u s  federal reserve s new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma  broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity  and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity 
this credit freeze brought the
to the brink of collapse  the response of the federal reserve  the   the
and other central banks was immediate and dramatic  during the last quarter of 2008  these central banks purchased us 2.5trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks  this was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market  and the largest monetary policy action  in world history  following a model initiated by the   the governments of european nations and the usa guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems  ultimately purchasing  1.5trillion newly issued
in their major banks  in october 2010  nobel laureate
explained how the u s  federal reserve was implementing another monetary policy creating currency as a method to combat the   by creating  600 billion and inserting   this directly into banks  the federal reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages  however  banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets  banks were also investing in foreign currencies  which stiglitz and others point out may lead to
while china redirects its currency holdings away from the united states 
governments have also
a variety of firms as discussed above  incurring large financial obligations  to date  various u s  government agencies have committed or spent trillions of dollars in loans  asset purchases  guarantees  and direct spending  significant controversy has accompanied the bailout  leading to the development of a variety of  decision making frameworks   to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis 
the u s  executed two stimulus packages  totaling nearly  1trillion during 2008 and 2009  other countries also implemented  
regulatory proposals and long-term responses  
further information      and
united states president
and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in june 2009  the proposals address consumer protection    bank financial cushions or capital requirements  expanded regulation of the
and   and enhanced authority for the federal reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions  among others  in january 2010  obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in   the proposals were dubbed  the    in recognition of   who has publicly argued for the proposed changes 
the u s  senate passed a reform bill in may 2010  following the house which passed a bill in december 2009  these bills must now be reconciled  the
provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills  which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the obama administration  for instance  the volcker rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation  though in the senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades 
european regulators introduced
regulations for banks  it increased capital ratios  limits on leverage  narrow definition of capital  to exclude subordinated debt   limit counter-party risk  and new liquidity requirements  critics argue that basel iii doesnt address the problem of faulty risk-weightings  major banks suffered losses from aaa-rated created by
 which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral  that required less capital according to basel ii  lending to aa-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero  thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis 
argues that regulations  basel iii among others  have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments  see   and the
pursues even more lending as the solution 
united states congress response  
at least two major reports were produced by congress  the
report  released january 2011  and a report by the
entitled

on december 11  2009  house cleared bill h r 4173  wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2009

continuation of the financial crisis in the u s  housing market  
as of 2012  in the united states  a large volume of troubled mortgages remained in place  it had proved impossible for most homeowners facing foreclosure to refinance or modify their mortgages and foreclosure rates remained high 
stabilization  
the u s  recession that began in december 2007 ended in june 2009  according to the u s 
 nber  and the financial crisis appears to have ended about the same time  in april 2009
magazine declared  more quickly than it began  the banking crisis is over   the united states financial crisis inquiry commission dates the crisis to 2008  president
declared on january 27  2010   the markets are now stabilized  and we ve recovered most of the money we spent on the banks  
the
identifies march 2009 as the  nadir of the crisis  and notes that  most stock markets around the world are at least 75 percent higher than they were then  financial stocks  which led the markets down  have also led them up   nevertheless  the lack of fundamental changes in banking and financial markets  worries many market participants  including the  
the distribution of household incomes in the united states has become more unequal during the post-2008   a first for the us but in line with the trend over the last ten economic recoveries since 1949 
has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas  median household wealth fell 35  in the us  from  106,591 to  68,839 between 2005 and 2011 
media coverage  
the financial crises generated many articles and books outside of the scholarly and financial press  including articles and books by author   economist   author and former bond salesman     and investment broker  
in may 2010  a documentary  overdose  a film about the next financial crisis  premiered about how the financial crisis came about and how the solutions that have been applied by many governments are setting the stage for the next crisis  the film is based on the book financial fiasco by johan norberg and features   with funding from the
think tank   greenspan is responsible for de-regulating the derivatives market while chairman of the federal reserve 
in october 2010  a documentary film about the crisis

emerging and developing economies drive global economic growth  
advanced economies led global economic growth prior to the financial crisis with  emerging  and  developing  economies lagging behind  the crisis completely overturned this relationship  the
found that  advanced  economies accounted for only 31  of global gdp while emerging and developing economies accounted for 69  of global gdp from 2007 to 2014  in the tables  the names of emergent economies are shown in boldface type  while the names of developed economies are in roman  regular  type
