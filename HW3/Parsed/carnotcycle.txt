the carnot cycle is a theoretical
proposed by
in 1824 and expanded upon by others in the 1830s and 1840s  it provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical thermodynamic engine can achieve during the conversion of
into   or conversely  the efficiency of a
system in creating a temperature difference  e g  refrigeration  by the application of work to the system  it is not an actual thermodynamic cycle but is a theoretical construct 
every single thermodynamic system exists in a particular state  when a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state  a thermodynamic cycle is said to have occurred  in the process of going through this cycle  the system may perform work on its surroundings  thereby acting as a   a system undergoing a carnot cycle is called a   although such a  perfect  engine is only a theoretical construct and cannot be built in practice 
essentially  there are two systems at temperatures th and tc  hot and cold respectively   which are so large that their temperatures are practically unaffected by a single cycle  as such  they are called  heat reservoirs   since the cycle is reversible  there is no generation of entropy during the cycle  entropy is conserved  during the cycle  an arbitrary amount of entropy s is extracted from the hot reservoir  and deposited in the cold reservoir  since there is no volume change in either reservoir  they do no work  and during the cycle  an amount of energy ths is extracted from the hot reservoir and a smaller amount of energy tcs is deposited in the cold reservoir  the difference in the two energies  th-tc s is equal to the work done by the engine

stages

to illustrate the work done 
the carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps 
reversible
expansion of the gas at the  hot  temperature  t1  isothermal heat addition or absorption   during this step  1 to 2 on figure 1  a to b in figure 2  the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings  the temperature of the gas does not change during the process  and thus the expansion is isothermal  the gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy q1 from the high temperature reservoir and results in an increase of entropy of the gas in the amount

   expansion of the gas  isentropic work output   for this step  2 to 3 on figure 1  b to c in figure 2  the mechanisms of the engine are assumed to be thermally insulated  thus they neither gain nor lose heat  an adiabatic process   the gas continues to expand  doing work on the surroundings  and losing an amount of internal energy equal to the work that leaves the system  the gas expansion causes it to cool to the  cold  temperature  t2  the entropy remains unchanged 
reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the  cold  temperature  t2   isothermal heat rejection   3 to 4 on figure 1  c to d on figure 2  now the surroundings do work on the gas  causing an amount of heat energy q2 to leave the system to the low temperature reservoir and the entropy of the system decreases in the amount

   this is the same amount of entropy absorbed in step 1  as can be seen from the   
isentropic compression of the gas  isentropic work input    4 to 1 on figure 1  d to a on figure 2  once again the mechanisms of the engine are assumed to be thermally insulated  and frictionless  hence reversible  during this step  the surroundings do work on the gas  increasing its internal energy and compressing it  causing the temperature to rise to t1 due solely to the work added to the system  but the entropy remains unchanged  at this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1

when the carnot cycle is plotted on a   the isothermal stages follow the isotherm lines for the working fluid  adiabatic stages move between isotherms and the area bounded by the complete cycle path represents the total work that can be done during one cycle 
properties and significance  
the temperature-entropy diagram  
figure 2  a carnot cycle acting as a heat engine  illustrated on a temperature-entropy diagram  the cycle takes place between a hot reservoir at temperature th and a cold reservoir at temperature tc  the vertical axis is temperature  the horizontal axis is entropy 
a generalized thermodynamic cycle taking place between a hot reservoir at temperature th and a cold reservoir at temperature tc  by the   the cycle cannot extend outside the temperature band from tc to th  the area in red qc is the amount of energy exchanged between the system and the cold reservoir  the area in white w is the amount of work energy exchanged by the system with its surroundings  the amount of heat exchanged with the hot reservoir is the sum of the two  if the system is behaving as an engine  the process moves clockwise around the loop  and moves counter-clockwise if it is behaving as a refrigerator  the efficiency to the cycle is the ratio of the white area  work  divided by the sum of the white and red areas  heat absorbed from the hot reservoir  
the behaviour of a carnot engine or refrigerator is best understood by using a
 ts diagram   in which the thermodynamic state is specified by a point on a graph with
 s  as the horizontal axis and temperature  t  as the vertical axis  for a simple closed system  control mass analysis   any point on the graph will represent a particular state of the system  a thermodynamic process will consist of a curve connecting an initial state  a  and a final state  b   the area under the curve will be

which is the amount of thermal energy transferred in the process  if the process moves to greater entropy  the area under the curve will be the amount of heat absorbed by the system in that process  if the process moves towards lesser entropy  it will be the amount of heat removed  for any cyclic process  there will be an upper portion of the cycle and a lower portion  for a clockwise cycle  the area under the upper portion will be the thermal energy absorbed during the cycle  while the area under the lower portion will be the thermal energy removed during the cycle  the area inside the cycle will then be the difference between the two  but since the internal energy of the system must have returned to its initial value  this difference must be the amount of work done by the system over the cycle  referring to figure 1  mathematically  for a reversible process we may write the amount of work done over a cyclic process as

since du is an   its integral over any closed loop is zero and it follows that the area inside the loop on a t-s diagram is equal to the total work performed if the loop is traversed in a clockwise direction  and is equal to the total work done on the system as the loop is traversed in a counterclockwise direction

the reversed carnot cycle  
the carnot heat-engine cycle described is a totally reversible cycle  that is  all the processes that comprise it can be reversed  in which case it becomes the carnot refrigeration cycle  this time  the cycle remains exactly the same except that the directions of any heat and work interactions are reversed  heat is absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir  heat is rejected to a high-temperature reservoir  and a work input is required to accomplish all this  the p-v diagram of the reversed carnot cycle is the same as for the carnot cycle except that the directions of the processes are reversed 
carnot s theorem  
main article 
it can be seen from the above diagram  that for any cycle operating between temperatures
t
h
  displaystyle t  h  
and
t
c
  displaystyle t  c  
  none can exceed the efficiency of a carnot cycle 
a real engine  left  compared to the carnot cycle  right   the entropy of a real material changes with temperature  this change is indicated by the curve on a t-s diagram  for this figure  the curve indicates a vapor-liquid equilibrium  see    irreversible systems and losses of energy  for example  work due to friction and heat losses  prevent the ideal from taking place at every step 
carnot s theorem is a formal statement of this fact  no engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a carnot engine operating between those same reservoirs  thus  equation 3 gives the maximum efficiency possible for any engine using the corresponding temperatures  a corollary to carnot s theorem states that  all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient  rearranging the right side of the equation gives what may be a more easily understood form of the equation  namely that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine equals the difference in temperature between the hot and cold reservoir divided by the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir  to find the absolute temperature in kelvin  add 273.15 degrees to the celsius temperature  looking at this formula an interesting fact becomes apparent  lowering the temperature of the cold reservoir will have more effect on the ceiling efficiency of a heat engine than raising the temperature of the hot reservoir by the same amount  in the real world  this may be difficult to achieve since the cold reservoir is often an existing ambient temperature 
in other words  maximum efficiency is achieved if and only if no new entropy is created in the cycle  which would be the case if e g  friction leads to
of work into heat  in that case the cycle is not reversible and the
becomes an inequality rather than an equality  otherwise  since entropy is a   the required dumping of heat into the environment to dispose of excess entropy leads to a  minimal  reduction in efficiency  so equation 3 gives the efficiency of any
 
in mesoscopic heat engines  work per cycle of operation fluctuates due to thermal noise  for the case when work and heat fluctuations are counted  there is exact equality that relates average of exponents of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath  this relation transforms carnot s inequality into an exact equality that applies to an arbitrary heat engine coupled to two heat reservoirs and operating at an arbitrary rate 
efficiency of real heat engines

and
carnot realized that in reality it is not possible to build a
engine  so real heat engines are even less efficient than indicated by equation 3  in addition  real engines that operate along this cycle are rare  nevertheless  equation 3 is extremely useful for determining the maximum efficiency that could ever be expected for a given set of thermal reservoirs 
although carnot s cycle is an idealisation  the expression of carnot efficiency is still useful  consider the

at which heat is input and output  respectively  replace th and tc in equation  3  by th and tc respectively 
for the carnot cycle  or its equivalent  the average value th will equal the highest temperature available  namely th  and tc the lowest  namely tc  for other less efficient cycles  th will be lower than th  and tc will be higher than tc  this can help illustrate  for example  why a
or a
can improve the thermal efficiency of steam power plantsand why the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle power plants  which incorporate gas turbines operating at even higher temperatures  exceeds that of conventional steam plants  the first prototype of the diesel engine was based on the carnot cycle
