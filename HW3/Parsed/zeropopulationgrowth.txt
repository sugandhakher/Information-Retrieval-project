zero population growth  sometimes abbreviated zpg  also called the    is a condition of
balance where the number of people in a specified population neither
nor   considered as a social aim by some  according to some  zero population growth  perhaps after stabilizing at some   is the ideal towards which countries and the whole world should aspire in the interests of accomplishing long-term environmental   what it means by the number of people neither grows nor declines is that births plus in-migrants equal deaths plus out-migrants

history  
a loosely defined goal of zpg is to match the   which is the average number of children per woman which would hold the population constant  this replacement fertility will depend on
and the sex ratio at birth  and varies from around 2.1 in developed countries to over 3.0 in some developing countries 
the american
and
is credited with coining the term but it was used earlier by george stolnitz  who stated that the concept of a
dated back to 1693  a mathematical description was given by  
in the late 1960s zpg became a prominent political movement in the u s  and parts of europe  with strong links to
and  
was a stronghold of the zpg activists who believed that a constantly increasing population is responsible for many of our problems  pollution  violence  loss of values and of individual privacy  founding fathers of the movement were   author of   richard bowers  a connecticut lawyer  and professor   ehrlich stated  the mother of the year should be a sterilized woman with two adopted children 
effects  
in the long term  zero population growth can be achieved when the
of a population equals the   i e  fertility is at replacement level and birth and death rates are stable  a condition also called demographic equilibrium  unstable rates can lead to drastic changes in population levels  this analysis is valid for the planet as whole  but not necessarily for a region or country as it ignores   a population that has been growing in the past will have a higher proportion of young people  as it is younger people who have children  there is large time lag between the point at which the fertility rate  mean total number of children each woman has during her childbearing years  falls to the replacement level  the fertility rate which would result in equal birth and death rates for a population at equilibrium  and the point at which the population stops rising  the reason for this is that even though the fertility rate has dropped to replacement level  people already within a population continue to live for some time  therefore  equilibrium  with a static population  will not be reached until the first  replacement level  birth cohorts reach old age and die  the related calculations are complex because the population s overall death rate can vary over time  and mortality also varies with age  being highest among the old  
conversely  with fertility below replacement  a large elderly generation eventually results  as in an aging    but since that generation failed to replace itself during its
years  a subsequent population bust  or decrease in population  will occur when the older generation dies off  this effect has been termed   in addition  if a country s fertility is at replacement level  and has been that way for at least several decades  to stabilize its age distribution   then that country s population could still experience coincident growth due to continuously increasing   even though the population growth is likely to be smaller than it would be from natural population increase 
zero population growth is often a goal of demographic planners and
who believe that reducing population growth is essential for the health of the   preserving cultural traditions and
is a factor for not allowing human populations levels or rates to fall too low  achieving zpg is difficult because a country s population growth is often determined by economic factors  incidence of poverty  natural disasters  disease  etc 
however  even if there is zero population growth  there may be changes in demographics of great   such as changes in  
how zpg can be achieved  
number of demographic experts have suggested a few ways to reach zero population growth 
biologist alan d  thornhill and author
argue that human population growth is a function of the human food supply and that human population growth can only be achieved by an expanded food supply to support the growing population  in 1998  they produced a video entitled    where they explain the theory and answer audience questions 
  an emeritus professor of physics at university of colorado at boulder in his lifetime  suggested that the population have following choices to be at zpg 
1  voluntarily limit births and immigration to achieve zero population growth 
2  continue on the present path until our population is so large that draconian measures become necessary to stop the growth of population 
3  do nothing and let nature stop the growth through disease  starvation  war and pestilence  if humans do not solve the problem  nature will 
similarly  jason brent  another demographic expert  argues that there are three to achieve zero population growth  his argument is as follows 
1  by war  with or without               and other horrors beyond the imagination  when humanity has exceeded the carrying capacity of the earth 
2  by the voluntary action of all of humanity prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the earth  if any group or even if a single-family failed to control its population the entire program would fail 
3  by coercive population control prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the earth 
in china  
is the largest country by population in the world  being home to some 1.3 billion people  china is expected to witness a zero population growth rate by 2030  china s population growth has slowed since the beginning of this century  this was mostly the result of china s economic growth and increasing living standards which led to the decline  however  many demographers also credit china s   which was formulated in the early 1970s  encourages late marriages  late childbearing  and the use of contraceptives  and since 1980 has limited most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children  according to government projections  the work-age population will then drop to 870 million  it was said  in 2009  that the chinese government was hoping to see zero population growth in the future but  in november 2013  a relaxation of the one-child policy was announced amid unpopularity  reduced labour pool and support for an ageing population
