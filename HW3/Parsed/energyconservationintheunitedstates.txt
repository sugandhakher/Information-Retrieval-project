the united states is the second-largest single consumer of energy in the world  the
categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors  transportation  residential  commercial  and industrial 
u s  energy flow - 2002  note that the breakdown of useful and waste energy in each sector  yellow vs  grey  may be misleading since the  lost  energy is largely unavoidable   second law of thermodynamics  heat engines can not decrease total entropy  so they have to dump heat into a low temperature material  
energy usage in transportation and residential sectors  about half of u s  energy consumption  is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers  commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by businesses entities and other facility managers  national energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors

transportation  
the transportation sector includes all
used for personal or freight transportation  of the energy used in this sector  approximately 65  is consumed by -powered vehicles  primarily personally owned  -powered transport  trains  merchant ships  heavy trucks  etc   consumes about 20   and air traffic consumes most of the remaining 15   the two
of the 1970s spurred the creation  in 1975  of the federal
 cafe  program  which required auto manufacturers to meet progressively higher fleet fuel economy targets  the next decade saw dramatic improvements in fuel economy  mostly the result of reductions in vehicle size and weight which originated in the late 1970s  along with the transition to   these gains eroded somewhat after 1990 due to the growing popularity of  
and   which fall under the more lenient  light truck  cafe standard 
in addition to the cafe program  the u s  government has tried to encourage better vehicle efficiency through tax policy  since 2002  taxpayers have been eligible for income tax credits for gas electric hybrid vehicles  a    tax has been assessed on manufacturers since 1978 for cars with exceptionally poor fuel economy  while this tax remains in effect  it generates very little revenue as overall fuel economy has improved 
another focus in gasoline conservation is reducing the number of miles driven  an estimated 40  of american automobile use is associated with daily   many urban areas offer
to reduce commuting traffic  and encourage
by providing designated
and lower tolls for cars with multiple riders  in recent years
has also become a viable alternative to commuting for some jobs  but in 2003 only 3.5  of workers were telecommuters  ironically  hundreds of thousands of american and european workers have been replaced by workers in
who telecommute from thousands of miles away 
also help reduce fuel consumption  among the most effective are moderate  as opposed to aggressive  driving  driving at lower speeds  using cruise control  and turning off a vehicle s engine at stops rather than idling  a vehicle s gas mileage decreases rapidly with increasing highway speeds  normally above 55 miles per hour  though the exact number varies by vehicle   this is because
are proportionally related to the square of an object s speed  when the speed is doubled 
quadruples   according to the u s  department of energy  doe   as a rule of thumb  each 5mph  8.0km h  you drive over 60mph  97km h  is similar to paying an additional  0.30 per gallon for gas  the exact speed at which a vehicle achieves its highest efficiency varies based on the vehicle s   frontal area  surrounding air speed  and the efficiency and gearing of a vehicle s
and transmission 
residential sector  
the residential sector refers to all private residences  including single-family homes  apartments 
and dormitories  energy use in this sector varies significantly across the country  due to regional climate differences and different regulation  on average  about half of the energy used in u s  homes is expended on space conditioning  i e  heating and cooling  
the efficiency of
and
has increased steadily since the energy crises of the 1970s  the 1987
authorized the department of energy to set minimum efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment and other appliances each year  based on what is  technologically feasible and economically justified   beyond these minimum standards  the
 epa  awards the
designation to appliances that exceed industry efficiency averages by an epa-specified percentage 
despite technological improvements  many american lifestyle changes have put higher demands on heating and cooling resources  the average size of homes built in the united states has increased significantly  from 1,500sqft  140m2  in 1970 to 2,300sqft  210m2  in 2005  the single-person household has become more common  as has central air conditioning  23  of households had central air conditioning in 1978  that figure rose to 55  by 2001 
as furnace efficiency gets higher  appropriate matching of equipment size to distribution system capacity and building load becomes more critical to optimizing equipment ability to maximize efficient operation  installing much lower output high efficiency replacement equipment offers opportunity for huge comfort and savings gains  but improving the
through air sealing and adding more   advanced windows  etc   should be explored concurrently or before replacement equipment design stage  the
approach produces
buildings that approach   improving the building envelope can also be cheaper than replacing a furnace or air conditioner 
even lower cost improvements include   which is frequently subsidized by utilities or state federal   as are programmable   consumers have also been urged to adopt a wider indoor temperature range  e g  65f  18c  in the winter  80f  27c  in the summer  
one underutilized  but potentially very powerful means to reduce household energy consumption is to provide real-time feedback to homeowners so they can effectively alter their energy using behavior  low cost   such as the energy detective or wattvision  have become available  a study of a similar device deployed in 500 homes in ontario  canada  by
showed an average 6.5  drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group 
used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off accounts for an estimated 5 to 10  of household electricity consumption  adding an estimated  3 billion to annual energy costs in the usa   in the average home  75  of the electricity used to power home electronics is consumed while the products are turned off  
home energy consumption averages  
home heating systems  28.9 
home cooling systems  14.0 
water heating  12.9 
lighting  9.0 
home electronics  7.1 
refrigerators and freezers  5.9 
clothing and dish washers  4.5   includes clothes dryers  does not include hot water 
cooking  3.7 
computers  2.2 
other  4.4   includes small electrics  heating elements  motors  pool and hot tub heaters  outdoor grills  and natural gas outdoor lighting 
non end-user energy expenditure  5.4  
energy usage in some homes may vary widely from these averages  for example  milder regions such as the southern u s  and pacific coast of the usa need far less energy for space conditioning than new york city or chicago  on the other hand  air conditioning energy use can be quite high in hot-arid regions  southwest  and hot-humid zones  southeast  in milder climates such as san diego  lighting energy may easily consume up to 40  of total energy  certain appliances such as a waterbed  hot tub  or pre-1990 refrigerator use significant amounts of electricity  however  recent trends in home entertainment equipment can make a large difference in household energy use  for instance a 50  lcd television  average on-time  6 hours a day  may draw 300 watts less than a similarly sized plasma system  in most residences no single appliance dominates  and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas in order to achieve substantial energy savings  however  ground  air and water source
systems  solar heating systems and
are among the more energy efficient  environmentally clean  and cost-effective space conditioning and domestic hot water systems available  environmental protection agency   and can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 69    
best building practices  
current best practices in building design  construction and
result in homes that are profoundly more energy conserving than average new homes  this includes insulation and energy-efficient windows and lighting 
smart ways to construct homes such that minimal resources are used to cooling and heating the house in summer and winter respectively can significantly reduce energy costs 
commercial sector  
the commercial sector consists of retail stores  offices  business and government   restaurants  schools and other workplaces  energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector  in slightly different proportions  space conditioning is again the single biggest consumption area  but it represents only about 30  of the energy use of commercial buildings  lighting  at 25   plays a much larger role than it does in the residential sector  lighting is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use  a number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of
can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings 
commercial buildings can greatly increase energy efficiency by thoughtful design  with today s building stock being very poor examples of the potential of systematic  not expensive  energy efficient design  steffy  1997   commercial buildings often have professional management  allowing centralized control and coordination of energy conservation efforts  as a result 
 about four times as efficient as incandescent  is the standard for most commercial space  although it may produce certain adverse health effects  potential health concerns can be mitigated by using newer fixtures with electronic ballasts rather than older magnetic ballasts  as most buildings have consistent hours of operation  programmed thermostats and lighting controls are common  however  too many companies believe that merely having a computer controlled
system guarantees energy efficiency  as an example one large company in northern california boasted that it was confident its state of the art system had optimized space heating  a more careful analysis by lumina technologies showed the system had been given programming instructions to maintain constant 24hour temperatures in the entire building complex  this instruction caused the injection of nighttime heat into vacant buildings when the daytime summer temperatures would often exceed 90f  32c   this mis-programming was costing the company over  130,000 per year in wasted energy  lumina technologies  1997   many corporations and governments also require the energy star rating for any new equipment purchased for their buildings 
solar heat loading through standard window designs usually leads to high demand for air conditioning in summer months  an example of building design overcoming this excessive heat loading is the
in   where fenestration was designed to achieve an angle with respect to sun incidence to allow maximum reflection of solar heat  this design also assisted in reducing interior
to enhance worker efficiency and comfort 
recent advances include use of occupancy sensors to turn off lights when spaces are unoccupied  and photosensors to dim or turn off electric lighting when natural light is available  in air conditioning systems  overall equipment efficiencies have increased as energy codes and consumer information have begun to emphasise year round performance rather than just efficiency ratings at maximum output  controllers that automatically vary the speeds of fans  pumps  and compressors have radically improved part-load performance of those devices  for space or water heating  electric
consume roughly half the energy required by electric resistance heaters  natural gas heating efficiencies have improved through use of condensing furnaces and boilers  in which the water vapor in the flue gas is cooled to liquid form before it is discharged  allowing the heat of condensation to be used  in buildings where high levels of outside air are required  heat exchangers can capture heat from the exhaust air to preheat incoming supply air 
a company in florida tackled the issue of both energy-conservation and enhancing its workplace environment by implementing a conveyor system that is 40-60  quieter than traditional systems  emitting a noise level of only 55-50 decibels  equivalent to a soft-rock radio station  lighting was addressed by not only programming the lighting console so that isolated lights could be switched on and off in designated areas of the warehouse  but also by enhancing natural lighting through the use of skylights and a high-gloss floor 
industrial sector  
the industrial sector represents all production and processing of goods  including manufacturing  construction  farming  water management and mining 
increasing costs have forced energy-intensive industries to make substantial efficiency improvements in the past 30 years  for example  the energy used to produce steel and paper products has been cut 40  in that time frame  while petroleum aluminum refining and cement production have reduced their usage by about 25   these reductions are largely the result of recycling waste material and the use of
equipment for electricity and heating 
another example for efficiency improvements is the use of products made of
 htiw  which enables predominantly industrial users to operate thermal treatment plants at temperatures between 800 and 1400c  in these high-temperature applications  the consumption of primary energy and the associated co2 emissions can be reduced by up to 50  compared with old fashioned industrial installations  the application of products made of high temperature insulation wool is becoming increasingly important against the background of the dramatic rising cost of energy 
u s  agriculture has doubled
in the last 25 years 
the energy required for delivery and treatment of fresh water often constitutes a significant percentage of a region s electricity and natural gas usage  an estimated 20  of california s total energy use is water-related   in light of this  some local governments have worked toward a more integrated approach to energy and
efforts 
to conserve energy  some industries have begun using    
unlike the other sectors  total energy use in the industrial sector has declined in the last decade  while this is partly due to conservation efforts  it is also a reflection of the growing trend for u s  companies to move manufacturing operations overseas 
government incentives and initiatives  
wartime propaganda for conservation at home
part b of title iii of the
established the   which gives the
the  authority to develop  revise  and implement minimum energy conservation standards for appliances and equipment  
as currently implemented  the department of energy enforces test procedures and minimum standards for more than 50 products covering residential  commercial and industrial  lighting  and plumbing applications 
the
included incentives which provide a tax credit of 30  of the cost of the new item with a  500 aggregate limit  the program was initially set to expire at the end of 2007 but was extended to 2010 and the aggregate limit increased to  1,500 by the
and   when it will expire 
the states and local areas  e g   cities or counties  have various initiatives  and the u s  department of energy funded a database known as dsire which provides information on these initiatives  the state of maryland has set a target of reducing its electricity usage by 15  from 2008 to 2015 
by   u s  president
mandated that by 2015  15  of existing federal buildings conform to new energy efficiency standards and 100  of all new
by 2030
