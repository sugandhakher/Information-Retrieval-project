created by the   a   based in       the internet archive launched the wayback machine in october 2001  it was set up by
and   and is maintained with content from   the service enables users to see archived versions of
across time  which the archive calls a  three dimensional index  
since 1996  the wayback machine has been archiving cached pages of websites onto its large cluster of
nodes  it revisits sites every few weeks or months and archives a new version  sites can also be captured on the fly by visitors who enter the site s
into a search box  the intent is to capture and archive content that otherwise would be lost whenever a site is changed or closed down  the grand vision of the machine s creators is to archive the entire internet 
the name wayback machine was chosen as a droll reference to a plot device in an animated cartoon    in one of the animated cartoon s component segments    lead characters
and sherman routinely used a
called the     pronounced way-back  to witness  participate in  and  more often than not  alter famous events in history

history  
origins  
in 1996 brewster kahle  with bruce gilliat  developed software to
and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages  the
hierarchy  the
 usenet  bulletin board system  and downloadable software  the information collected by these  crawlers  does not include all the information available on the internet  since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible  these  crawlers  also respect the
for websites whose owners opt for them not to appear in search results or be   to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites  archive-it org was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content  and create digital archives 
information had been kept on digital tape for five years  with kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database  when the archive reached its fifth anniversary  it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the  
snapshots usually become available more than six months after they are archived or  in some cases  even later  it can take twenty-four months or longer  the frequency of snapshots is variable  so not all tracked website updates are recorded  sometimes there are intervals of several weeks or years between snapshots 
after august 2008 sites had to be listed on the
in order to be included  according to jeff kaplan of the internet archive in november 2010  other sites were still being archived  but more recent captures would become visible only after the next major indexing  an infrequent operation 
storage capabilities  
as of 2009  the wayback machine contained approximately three
of data and was growing at a rate of 100
each month  the growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytes month  the data is stored on
rack systems manufactured by  
in 2009  the internet archive migrated its customized storage architecture to   and hosts a new data center in a
on   california campus 
in 2011 a new  improved version of the wayback machine  with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content  was made available for public testing 
in march 2011  it was said on the wayback machine forum that  the beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and up-to-date index of all crawled materials into 2010  and will continue to be updated regularly  the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008  and no further index updates are planned  as it will be phased out this year  
in january 2013  the company announced a ground-breaking milestone of 240 billion urls 
in october 2013  the company announced the  save a page  feature which allows any internet user to archive the contents of a url  this became a threat of abuse by the service for  
as of december 2014  the wayback machine contained almost nine
of data and was growing at a rate of about 20

use in legal evidence  
civil litigation  
netbula llc v  chordiant software inc   
in a 2009 case  netbula  llc v  chordiant software inc   defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the
file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbula s site  pages that chordiant believed would support its case 
netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbula s website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly  an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiant s motion  however  stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means  without considerable burden  expense and disruption to its operations  
magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california  san jose division  rejected netbula s arguments and ordered them to disable the robots txt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought 
telewizja polska  
in an october 2004 case 
v  echostar satellite  no  02 c 3293  65 fed  r  evid  serv  673  n d  ill  oct  15  2004   a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence  perhaps for the first time  telewizja polska is the provider of
and
operates the   prior to the trial proceedings  echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polska s website  telewizja polska brought a motion
to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of
and unauthenticated source  but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polska s assertion of hearsay and denied tvp s motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial  at the trial  however  district court judge ronald guzman  the trial judge  overruled magistrate keys  findings    and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages  i e   the telewizja polska website  were admissible as evidence  judge guzman reasoned that the employee s affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements  and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating   
patent law  
main article 
provided some additional requirements are met  e g  providing an authoritative statement of the archivist   the
and the
will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public  these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as
for instance in examining a patent application 
limitations of utility  
there are technical limitations to archiving a website  and as a consequence  it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives  this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints  answers  or expert witness reports  when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore  can contain errors  for example  archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore  do not include the contents of non- e-commerce databases in their archives 
legal status  
in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws  only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated  so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator  the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site  the wayback machine also retroactively respects
files  i e   pages that currently are blocked to robots on the live web temporarily will be made unavailable from the archives as well 
archived content legal issues  
a number of cases have been brought against the internet archive specifically for its wayback machine archiving efforts 
scientology

in late 2002  the internet archive removed various sites that were critical of
from the wayback machine  an error message stated that this was in response to a  request by the site owner   later  it was clarified that lawyers from the
had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed 
healthcare advocates  inc   
in 2003  harding earley follmer   frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archive s wayback machine  the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid  based on the content of their website from several years prior  the plaintiff  healthcare advocates  then amended their complaint to include the internet archive  accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the
and the   healthcare advocates claimed that  since they had installed a
file on their website  even if after the initial lawsuit was filed  the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine  the lawsuit was settled out of court 
robots txt is used as part of the   a voluntary protocol the internet archive respects that disallows bots from indexing certain pages delineated by its creator as off-limits  as a result  the internet archive has rendered unavailable a number of websites that now are inaccessible through the wayback machine  currently  the internet archive applies robots txt rules retroactively  if a site blocks the internet archive  such as healthcare advocates  any previously archived pages from the domain are rendered unavailable as well  in cases of blocked sites  only the robots txt file is archived 
the internet archive states  however   sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site  we comply with these requests   in addition  the website says   the internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection  
suzanne shell  
in december 2005  activist
filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us  100,000 for archiving her website profane-justice org between 1999 and 2004  internet archive filed a
action in the
on january 20  2006  seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shell s   shell responded and brought a
against internet archive for archiving her site  which she alleges is in violation of her   on february 13  2007  a judge for the
dismissed all counterclaims except   the internet archive did not move to dismiss
claims shell asserted arising out of its copying activities  which would also go forward 
on april 25  2007  internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit  the internet archive said it     has no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived  we recognize that ms  shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation   shell said   i respect the historical value of internet archive s goal  i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm
