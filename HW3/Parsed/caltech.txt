history  
throop college  
throop polytechnic institute  pasadena  california  1908  on its original campus at downtown pasadena
caltech started as a
founded in pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician   the school was known successively as throop university  throop polytechnic institute  and manual training school   and throop college of technology  before acquiring its current name in 1920  the vocational school was disbanded and the preparatory program was split off to form an independent
in 1907 
at a time when scientific research in the united states was still in its infancy    a solar astronomer from the   founded the
in 1904  he joined throop s board of trustees in 1907  and soon began developing it and the whole of pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination  he engineered the appointment of   a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser  to throop s presidency in 1908  scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee charles w  gates to donate  25,000 in seed money to build gates laboratory  the first science building on campus 
world wars  
in 1910  throop moved to its current site  arther fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site 
delivered an address at throop institute on march 21  1911  and he declared 
i want to see institutions like throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them  i want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the
and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this countryand the one-hundredth man i want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer  george ellery hale 
throop hall  1912
in the same year  a bill was introduced in the
calling for the establishment of a publicly funded  california institute of technology   with an initial budget of a million dollars  ten times the budget of throop at the time  the board of trustees offered to turn throop over to the state  but the presidents of
and the
successfully lobbied to defeat the bill  which allowed throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern california  public or private  until the onset of the world war ii necessitated the broader development of research-based science education  the promise of throop attracted
from
to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology 
with the onset of world war i  hale organized the
to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems  while he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science  he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges  and instead sought to raise a  1 million national research fund entirely from private sources  to that end  as hale wrote in  
throop college of technology  in pasadena california has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the research council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation  this institution  with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories  could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation  president scherer  hearing of the formation of the council  immediately offered to take part in its work  and with this object  he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars 
through the national research council  hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs  and for throop to play a national role in science  the new funds were designated for physics research  and ultimately led to the establishment of the norman bridge laboratory  which attracted experimental

millikan served as  chairman of the executive council   effectively caltech s president  from 1921 to 1945  and his influence was such that the institute was occasionally referred to as  millikan s school   millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining caltech  scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as      
and  
arrived on the caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his   and he returned to caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933 
during world war ii  caltech was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the
which offered students a path to a navy commission  the
also maintained a naval training school for   resident inspectors of ordnance and naval material  and a liaison officer to the

of particle physics  feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and colorful  unconventional character 
during  s tenure as caltech s president  19461969   caltech s faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size  dubridge  unlike his predecessors  welcomed
of science  new research fields flourished  including       and   a 200-inch telescope was dedicated on nearby palomar mountain in 1948 and remained the world s most powerful optical telescope for over forty years 
caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of
in 1970  and they made up 14  of the entering class  the fraction of female undergraduates has been increasing since then 
caltech undergraduates have historically been so apathetic to politics     that there has been only one organized student protest in january 1968 outside the burbank studios of   in response to rumors that nbc was to cancel   in 1973  the students from
protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase     the following week  ross mccollum  president of the   wrote an open letter to dabney house stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to caltech  the dabney family  being republicans  disowned dabney house after hearing of the prank

caused some damage to the caltech campus  engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the institutethroop hall and the goodhue-designed culbertson auditoriumhad cracked  these were some of the first
buildings  and their plans did not contain enough details  such as how much
had been embedded in the concrete  to be sure they were safe  so the engineers recommended demolition  however  demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse  a large
was used to demolish throop hall  and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar  far in excess of safety requirements  the rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away  and the process took much longer than expected 
new additions to the campus include the cahill center for astronomy and astrophysics and the

prior to the entering class of 2017  caltech requires students to take a core curriculum of three terms of mathematics  three terms of physics  two terms of chemistry  one term of biology  two terms of lab courses  one terms of scientific communication  three terms of physical education  and 12 terms of humanities and social science 
breezeway of arms laboratory
a typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options  degree requirements  students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term  more than four classes  in order to graduate in four years  36 units is the minimum full-time load  48 units is considered a heavy load  and registrations above 54 units require an overload petition  approximately 20 percent of students double-major  this is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major  although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged  it is still possible 
first-year students are enrolled in first-term classes based upon results of placement exams in math  physics  chemistry  and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a pass fail basis  there is little competition  collaboration on
is encouraged and the honor system encourages take-home tests and flexible homework schedules  caltech offers co-operative programs with other schools  such as the pasadena
and  
upon graduation  caltech alumni have one of the highest median starting salary among graduates of other colleges or universities in 20122013  of  67,400  according to   the mid-career median pay is  120,700  caltech was found to offer the second highest return of investment of college education  at  1,991,000 over a 30-year period  according to the same study

grants md phd degrees  students in this program do their preclinical and clinical work at
or   and their phd work with any member of the caltech faculty  including the biology  chemistry  and engineering and applied sciences divisions  the md degree would be from usc or ucla and the phd would be awarded from caltech 
the research facilities at caltech are available to graduate students  but there are opportunities for students to work in facilities of other universities  research centers as well as private industries  the graduate student to faculty ratio is 4 1 
approximately 99 percent of doctoral students have full financial support  financial support for graduate students comes in the form of fellowships  research assistantships  teaching assistantships or a combination of fellowship and assistantship support 
graduate students are bound by the honor code  as are the undergraduates  and the graduate honor council oversees any violations of the code 
research  
caltech was elected to the
in 1934 and remains a research university with  very high  research activity  primarily in   caltech manages research expenditures of  270 million annually  66th among all universities in the u s  and 17th among private institutions without medical schools for 2008  the largest federal agencies contributing to research are         and   caltech received  144 million in federal funding for the physical sciences   40.8 million for the life sciences   33.5 million for engineering   14.4 million for environmental sciences   7.16 million for computer sciences  and  1.97 million for mathematical sciences in 2008 
the institute was awarded an all-time high funding of  357 million in 2009  active funding from the
directorate of mathematical and physical science  mps  for caltech stands at  343 million as of 2011  the highest for any educational institution in the nation  and higher than the total funds allocated to any state except california and new york 
the new schlinger laboratory for chemistry and chemical engineering
in 2005  caltech had 739,000 square feet  68,700m2  dedicated to research  330,000 square feet  30,700m2  to physical sciences  163,000 square feet  15,100m2  to engineering  and 160,000 square feet  14,900m2  to biological sciences

every   dabney house conducts the infamous  millikan pumpkin-drop experiment  from the top of millikan library  the highest point on campus  according to tradition  a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in
and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a
spark  this yearly event involves a crowd of observers  who try to spot the elusive spark  the title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous
which measured e  the  
the beckman auditorium
on ditch day  the seniors ditch school  leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering  over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical  electrical  and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen  each group of seniors designs a  stack  to be solved by a handful of underclassmen  the faculty have been drawn into the event as well  and cancel all classes on ditch day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year 
another long-standing tradition is the playing of wagner s    at 7 00 each morning during finals week with the largest  loudest speakers available  the playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time  except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of    and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed  the playing of the ride is such a strong tradition that the music was used during

in recent years  pranking has been officially encouraged by tom mannion  caltech s assistant vp for student affairs and campus life   the grand old days of pranking have gone away at caltech  and that s what we are trying to bring back   reported the boston globe 
in december 2011  caltech students went to new york and pulled a prank on manhattan s   the prank involved making
sculpture look like the
weighted companion cube from the video game  
caltech pranks have been documented in three legends of caltech books  the most recent of which was edited by alumni autumn looijen  99 and mason a  porter  98 and published in may 2007 
rivalry with mit  
main article 
in 2005  a group of caltech students pulled a string of pranks during mit s campus preview weekend for admitted students  these include covering up the word massachusetts in the  massachusetts institute of technology  engraving on the main building faade with a banner so that it read  that other institute of technology   a group of
responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read  the only institute of technology   caltech students also passed out t-shirts to mit s incoming freshman class that had mit written on the front and      because not everyone can go to caltech  along with an image of a palm tree on the back 
mit retaliated in april 2006  when students posing as the howe   ser  howitzer  moving company stole the 130-year-old  1.7-ton fleming house cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in cambridge  massachusetts for their 2006 campus preview weekend  repeating a similar prank performed by nearby
in 1986  thirty members of fleming house traveled to mit and reclaimed their cannon on april 10  2006 
on april 13  2007  friday the 13th   a group of students from the california tech  caltech s campus newspaper  arrived and distributed fake copies of the tech  mit s campus newspaper  while prospective students were visiting for their campus preview weekend  articles included  mit invents the interweb    architects deem campus  unfortunate    and  infinite corridor not actually infinite  
in december 2009  some caltech students declared that mit had been sold and had become the caltech east campus  a  sold  banner was hung on front of the mit dome building and a  welcome to caltech east  school of the humanities  banner over the massachusetts avenue entrance  newspapers and t-shirts were distributed  and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the  curriculum change  
in september 2010  mit students attempted to put a   the time machine from the bbc s   onto a roof  caught in midact  the prank was aborted  in january 2011  caltech students in conjunction with mit students helped put the tardis on top of baxter  caltech students then moved the tardis to
and  
in april 2014  during mit s campus preview weekend  a group of caltech students handed out mugs emblazoned with the mit logo on the front and the words  the institute of technology  on the back  when heated  the mugs turn orange  display a palm tree  and read  caltech the hotter institute of technology   identical mugs continue to be sold at the caltech campus store 
honor code  
life in the caltech community is governed by the   which simply states   no member of the caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the caltech community   this is enforced by a board of control  which consists of undergraduate students  and by a similar body at the graduate level  called the graduate honor council 
the honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere  for example  the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home  allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment 
through the late 1990s  the only exception to the honor code  implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations  concerned the sexual harassment policy  today  there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy  and alcohol policy  though both policies are presented in the honor system handbook given to new members of the caltech community  some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community

caltech startups  
over the years caltech has actively promoted the commercialization of technologies developed within its walls  through its office of technology transfer   corporate partnerships  scientific breakthroughs have led to the transfer of numerous technologies in a wide variety of scientific-related fields such as  
 rfid        
design  solid state amplifiers  and many more  companies such as contour energy systems    fulcrum microsystems  nanosys  inc       wavestream wireless have emerged from caltech 
in media and popular culture  
caltech has appeared in many works of popular culture  both as itself and in disguised form    a caltech reference is often used to establish a character s high level of intelligence or a technical background  for example  in the novel
