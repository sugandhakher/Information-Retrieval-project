an electric battery is a device consisting of one or more
with external connections provided to power electrical devices such as     and   when a battery is supplying   its positive terminal is the
and its negative terminal is the   the terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device  when a battery is connected to an external circuit 
are able to move as ions within  allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the external circuit  it is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work  historically the term  battery  specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells  however the usage has evolved to additionally include devices composed of a single cell 
 single-use or  disposable   batteries are used once and discarded  the
materials are irreversibly changed during discharge  common examples are the
used for

batteries come in many shapes and sizes  from miniature cells used to power
and wristwatches to small  thin cells used in   to large
used in cars and trucks  and at the largest extreme  huge battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby or emergency power for
and computer  
according to a 2005 estimate  the worldwide battery industry generates us 48
in sales each year  with 6  annual growth 
batteries have much lower
 energy per unit mass  than common
such as gasoline  this is somewhat offset by the higher efficiency of electric motors in producing mechanical work  compared to combustion engines

history
main article 
a   the first battery
demonstrating his pile to french emperor
the usage of  battery  to describe a group of electrical devices dates to   who in 1748 described multiple
by analogy to a
 benjamin franklin borrowed the term  battery  from the military  which refers to weapons functioning together  
built and described the first electrochemical battery  the   in 1800  this was a stack of copper and zinc plates  separated by brine-soaked paper disks  that could produce a steady current for a considerable length of time  volta did not understand that the voltage was due to chemical reactions  he thought that his cells were an inexhaustible source of energy  and that the associated corrosion effects at the electrodes were a mere nuisance  rather than an unavoidable consequence of their operation  as
showed in 1834 
although early batteries were of great value for experimental purposes  in practice their voltages fluctuated and they could not provide a large current for a sustained period  the   invented in 1836 by british chemist   was the first practical source of electricity  becoming an industry standard and seeing widespread adoption as a power source for
networks  it consisted of a copper pot filled with a
solution  in which was immersed an unglazed
container filled with
and a zinc electrode 
these wet cells used liquid electrolytes  which were prone to leakage and spillage if not handled correctly  many used glass jars to hold their components  which made them fragile and potentially dangerous  these characteristics made wet cells unsuitable for portable appliances  near the end of the nineteenth century  the invention of   which replaced the liquid electrolyte with a paste  made portable electrical devices practical 
principle of operation
main article 
a voltaic cell for demonstration purposes  in this example the two half-cells are linked by a
separator that permits the transfer of ions 
batteries convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy  a battery consists of some number of voltaic cells  each cell consists of two
connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations  one half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode  the electrode to which
 negatively charged ions  migrate  the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which
 positively charged ions  migrate 
reactions power the battery  cations are reduced  electrons are added  at the cathode during charging  while anions are oxidized  electrons are removed  at the anode during charging  during discharge  the process is reversed  the electrodes do not touch each other  but are electrically connected by the   some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell  a separator allows ions to flow between half-cells  but prevents mixing of the electrolytes 
each half-cell has an
 or emf   determined by its ability to drive electric current from the interior to the exterior of the cell  the net emf of the cell is the difference between the emfs of its half-cells  thus  if the electrodes have emfs

across the
of a cell is known as the terminal voltage  difference  and is measured in   the terminal voltage of a cell that is neither charging nor discharging is called the
and equals the emf of the cell  because of internal resistance  the terminal voltage of a cell that is discharging is smaller in magnitude than the open-circuit voltage and the terminal voltage of a cell that is charging exceeds the open-circuit voltage  an ideal cell has negligible internal resistance  so it would maintain a constant terminal voltage of

until exhausted  then dropping to zero  if such a cell maintained 1.5 volts and stored a charge of one
then on complete discharge it would perform 1.5
of work  in actual cells  the internal resistance increases under discharge and the open circuit voltage also decreases under discharge  if the voltage and resistance are plotted against time  the resulting graphs typically are a curve  the shape of the curve varies according to the chemistry and internal arrangement employed 
the voltage developed across a cell s terminals depends on the energy release of the chemical reactions of its electrodes and electrolyte 
and
cells have different chemistries  but approximately the same emf of 1.5 volts  likewise
and
cells have different chemistries  but approximately the same emf of 1.2 volts  the high electrochemical potential changes in the reactions of
compounds give lithium cells emfs of 3 volts or more

 cr2032 and lr44 
batteries are classified into primary and secondary forms 
primary batteries are designed to be used until exhausted of energy then discarded  their chemical reactions are generally not reversible  so they cannot be recharged  when the supply of reactants in the battery is exhausted  the battery stops producing current and is useless 
secondary batteries can be recharged  that is  they can have their chemical reactions reversed by applying
to the cell  this regenerates the original chemical reactants  so they can be used  recharged  and used again multiple times 
some types of primary batteries used  for example  for
circuits  were restored to operation by replacing the electrodes  secondary batteries are not indefinitely rechargeable due to dissipation of the active materials  loss of electrolyte and internal corrosion 
primary
main article 
primary batteries  or   can produce current immediately on assembly  these are most commonly used in portable devices that have low current drain  are used only intermittently  or are used well away from an alternative power source  such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available  disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged  since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms  battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells  in general  these have higher
than rechargeable batteries  but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with
under 75
 75    common types of disposable batteries include
and  
secondary
main article 
secondary batteries  also known as secondary cells  or rechargeable batteries  must be charged before first use  they are usually assembled with active materials in the discharged state  rechargeable batteries are  re charged by applying electric current  which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge use  devices to supply the appropriate current are called chargers 
the oldest form of rechargeable battery is the   which are widely used in
and
applications  this technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container  requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the
gas it produces during overcharging  the leadacid battery is relatively heavy for the amount of electrical energy it can supply  its low manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity  over approximately 10 ah  is more important than weight and handling issues  a common application is the modern   which can  in general  deliver a peak current of 450  
the sealed
 vrla battery  is popular in the automotive industry as a replacement for the leadacid wet cell  the vrla battery uses an immobilized
electrolyte  reducing the chance of leakage and extending   vrla batteries immobilize the electrolyte  the two types are 
 or  gel cell   use a semi-solid electrolyte 
 agm  batteries absorb the electrolyte in a special fiberglass matting 
other portable rechargeable batteries include several sealed  dry cell  types  that are useful in applications such as mobile phones and   cells of this type  in order of increasing
and cost  include
 nicd  
 nizn  
 nimh   and
 li-ion  cells  li-ion has by far the highest share of the dry cell rechargeable market  nimh has replaced nicd in most applications due to its higher capacity  but nicd remains in use in     and  
in the 2000s  developments include batteries with embedded electronics such as   which allows charging an aa battery through a
connector 
that allow for a discharge rate about 100x greater than current batteries  and
packs with state-of-charge monitors and battery protection circuits that prevent damage on over-discharge

cell types
many types of electrochemical cells have been produced  with varying chemical processes and designs  including      
and voltaic piles 
wet cell
a wet cell battery has a liquid   other names are flooded cell  since the liquid covers all internal parts  or vented cell  since gases produced during operation can escape to the air  wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for   they can be built with common laboratory supplies  such as   for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work  a particular type of wet cell known as a
is important in understanding   wet cells may be
 non-rechargeable  or
 rechargeable   originally  all practical primary batteries such as the
were built as open-top glass jar wet cells  other primary wet cells are the           and   the leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells  wet cells are still used in
and in industry for standby power for   telecommunication or large   but in many places batteries with

a dry cell uses a paste electrolyte  with only enough moisture to allow current to flow  unlike a wet cell  a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling  as it contains no free liquid  making it suitable for portable equipment  by comparison  the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage  leadacid batteries did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the

reserve
a
can be stored unassembled  unactivated and supplying no power  for a long period  perhaps years   when the battery is needed  then it is assembled  e g   by adding electrolyte   once assembled  the battery is charged and ready to work  for example  a battery for an electronic artillery
might be activated by the impact of firing a gun  the acceleration breaks a capsule of electrolyte that activates the battery and powers the fuze s circuits  reserve batteries are usually designed for a short service life  seconds or minutes  after long storage  years   a
for oceanographic instruments or military applications becomes activated on immersion in water 
cell performance
a battery s characteristics may vary over load cycle  over   and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry 
drain  and temperature  at low temperatures  a battery cannot deliver as much power  as such  in cold climates  some car owners install battery warmers  which are small electric heating pads that keep the car battery warm 
capacity and discharge
a device to check battery voltage
a battery s capacity is the amount of
it can deliver at the rated voltage  the more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity  a small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry  although they develop the same open-circuit voltage  capacity is measured in units such as
 ah   the rated capacity of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at 68f  20c   while remaining above a specified terminal voltage per cell  for example  a battery rated at 100 ah can deliver 5 a over a 20-hour period at   the fraction of the stored charge that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors  including battery chemistry  the rate at which the charge is delivered  current   the required terminal voltage  the storage period  ambient temperature and other factors 
the higher the discharge rate  the lower the capacity  the relationship between current  discharge time and capacity for a lead acid battery is approximated  over a typical range of current values  by

is the amount of time  in hours  that a battery can sustain 
k
  displaystyle k 
is a constant around 1.3 
batteries that are stored for a long period or that are discharged at a small fraction of the capacity lose capacity due to the presence of generally irreversible side reactions that consume charge carriers without producing current  this phenomenon is known as internal self-discharge  further  when batteries are recharged  additional side reactions can occur  reducing capacity for subsequent discharges  after enough recharges  in essence all capacity is lost and the battery stops producing power 
internal energy losses and limitations on the rate that ions pass through the electrolyte cause battery
to vary  above a minimum threshold  discharging at a low rate delivers more of the battery s capacity than at a higher rate  installing batteries with varying ah ratings does not affect device operation  although it may affect the operation interval  rated for a specific voltage unless load limits are exceeded  high-drain loads such as
can reduce total capacity  as happens with alkaline batteries  for example  a battery rated at 2ah for a 10- or 20-hour discharge would not sustain a current of 1a for a full two hours as its stated capacity implies 
c rate
the c-rate is a measure of the rate at which a battery is being discharged  it is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour  a 1c discharge rate would deliver the battery s rated capacity in 1 hour  a 2c discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast  30 minutes   a 1c discharge rate on a 1.6 ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 a  a 2c rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 a  standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour  8 hour or longer discharge time  because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells  a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour  types intended for special purposes  such as in a computer   may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour 
fast-charging  large and light batteries

was the fastest-charging discharging  fully discharging in 1020 seconds 
as of 2013  the world s largest battery was in   china  it stored 36 megawatt-hours of electricity at a cost of  500 million  another large battery  composed of
cells  was in   it covered 2,000 square metres  22,000sqft bigger than a football pitchand weighed 1,300 tonnes  it was manufactured by
to provide backup power in the event of a blackout  the battery can provide 40 megawatts of power for up to seven minutes 
have been used to store   a 4.4 megawatt-hour battery system that can deliver 11 megawatts for 25 minutes stabilizes the output of the auwahi wind farm in hawaii 
were used on the longest and highest solar-powered flight  the recharging speed of lithium-ion batteries can be increased by manufacturing changes 
lifetime
battery life  and its synonym battery lifetime  has two meanings for rechargeable batteries but only one for non-chargeables  for rechargeables  it can mean either the length of time a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily  for a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition   the term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use   available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature  in contrast to most of today s batteries  the   invented in 1812  offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge  although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range  the
has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries  thought to be zamboni piles 
self-discharge
disposable batteries typically lose 8 to 20 percent of their original charge per year when stored at room temperature  2030c   this is known as the  self-discharge  rate  and is due to non-current-producing  side  chemical reactions that occur within the cell even when no load is applied  the rate of side reactions is reduced for batteries are stored at lower temperatures  although some can be damaged by freezing 
old rechargeable batteries self-discharge more rapidly than disposable alkaline batteries  especially nickel-based batteries  a freshly charged nickel cadmium  nicd  battery loses 10  of its charge in the first 24 hours  and thereafter discharges at a rate of about 10  a month  however  newer
and modern lithium designs display a lower self-discharge rate  but still higher than for primary batteries  
corrosion
internal parts may corrode and fail  or the active materials may be slowly converted to inactive forms 
physical component changes
rechargeable batteries
the active material on the battery plates changes chemical composition on each charge and discharge cycle  active material may be lost due to physical changes of volume  further limiting the number of times the battery can be recharged  most nickel-based batteries are partially discharged when purchased  and must be charged before first use  newer nimh batteries are ready to be used when purchased  and have only 15  discharge in a year 
some deterioration occurs on each chargedischarge cycle  degradation usually occurs because electrolyte migrates away from the electrodes or because active material detaches from the electrodes  low-capacity nimh batteries  1,7002,000mah  can be charged some 1,000 times  whereas high-capacity nimh batteries  above 2,500mah  last about 500 cycles  nicd batteries tend to be rated for 1,000 cycles before their internal resistance permanently increases beyond usable values 
charge discharge speed
fast charging increases component changes  shortening battery lifespan 
overcharging
if a charger cannot detect when the battery is fully charged then overcharging is likely  damaging it

environmental conditions
rechargeable batteries must endure stress due to vibration  shock  and temperature range  because of these stresses and
of their lead plates  few automotive batteries last beyond six years of regular use  automotive starting    starting  lighting  ignition  batteries have many thin plates to maximize current  in general  the thicker the plates the longer the life  they are typically discharged only slightly before recharge 
 deep-cycle  leadacid batteries such as those used in electric golf carts have much thicker plates to extend longevity  the main benefit of the leadacid battery is its low cost  its main drawbacks are large size and weight for a given capacity and voltage  leadacid batteries should never be discharged to below 20  of their capacity  because internal resistance will cause heat and damage when they are recharged  deep-cycle leadacid systems often use a low-charge warning light or a low-charge power cut-off switch to prevent the type of damage that will shorten the battery s life 
storage
battery life can be extended by storing the batteries at a low temperature  as in a
or   which slows the side reactions  such storage can extend the life of alkaline batteries by about 5   rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer  depending upon type  to reach their maximum voltage  batteries must be returned to room temperature  discharging an alkaline battery at 250 ma at 0c is only half as efficient as at 20c  alkaline battery manufacturers such as
do not recommend refrigerating batteries 
battery sizes

hazards
explosion
this section does not
any   please help improve this section by   unsourced material may be challenged and    january 2012    
a battery explosion is caused by misuse or malfunction  such as attempting to recharge a primary  non-rechargeable  battery  or a   car batteries are most likely to explode when a short-circuit generates very large currents  car batteries produce   which is very explosive  when they are overcharged  because of
of the water in the electrolyte   the amount of overcharging is usually very small and generates little hydrogen  which dissipates quickly  however  when  jumping  a car battery  the high current can cause the rapid release of large volumes of hydrogen  which can be ignited explosively by a nearby spark  for example  when disconnecting a   when a battery is recharged at an excessive rate  an explosive gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery  leading to pressure build-up and eventual bursting of the battery case  in extreme cases  battery acid may spray violently from the casing and cause injury  overchargingthat is  attempting to charge a battery beyond its electrical capacitycan also lead to a battery explosion  in addition to leakage or irreversible damage  it may also cause damage to the charger or device in which the overcharged battery is later used  in addition  disposing of a battery via incineration may cause an explosion as steam builds up within the sealed case 
leakage
leak-damaged alkaline battery
many battery chemicals are corrosive  poisonous or both  if leakage occurs  either spontaneously or through accident  the chemicals released may be dangerous  for example  disposable batteries often use a zinc  can  both as a reactant and as the container to hold the other reagents  if this kind of battery is over-discharged  the reagents can emerge through the cardboard and plastic that form the remainder of the container  the active chemical leakage can then damage or disable the equipment that the batteries power  for this reason  many electronic device manufacturers recommend removing the batteries from devices that will not be used for extended periods of time 
toxic materials
many types of batteries employ toxic materials such as lead    and
as an electrode or electrolyte  when each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage  batteries are one form of
 e-waste   e-waste
services recover toxic substances  which can then be used for new batteries  of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the united states  about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country  in the united states  the
of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries  enacted uniform labeling requirements for rechargeable batteries and required that rechargeable batteries be easily removable  california and new york city prohibit the disposal of rechargeable batteries in solid waste  and along with maine require recycling of cell phones  the rechargeable battery industry operates nationwide recycling programs in the united states and canada  with dropoff points at local retailers 
the
of the european union has similar requirements  in addition to requiring increased recycling of batteries and promoting research on improved
methods  in accordance with this directive all batteries to be sold within the eu must be marked with the  collection symbol   a crossed-out wheeled bin   this must cover at least 3  of the surface of prismatic batteries and 1.5  of the surface of cylindrical batteries  all packaging must be marked likewise 
ingestion
batteries may be harmful or fatal if   small
can be swallowed  in particular by young children  while in the digestive tract  the battery s electrical discharge may lead to tissue damage  such damage is occasionally serious and can lead to death  ingested disk batteries do not usually cause problems unless they become lodged in the   the most common place for disk batteries to become lodged is the esophagus  resulting in clinical sequelae  batteries that successfully traverse the esophagus are unlikely to lodge elsewhere  the likelihood that a disk battery will lodge in the esophagus is a function of the patient s age and battery size  disk batteries of 16mm have become lodged in the esophagi of 2 children younger than 1 year    older children do not have problems with batteries smaller than 2123mm  liquefaction necrosis may occur because sodium hydroxide is generated by the current produced by the battery  usually at the anode   perforation has occurred as rapidly as 6 hours after ingestion

almost any liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be electrically conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell  as a novelty or science demonstration  it is possible to insert two electrodes made of different metals into a   potato  etc  and generate small amounts of electricity   two-potato clocks  are also widely available in hobby and toy stores  they consist of a pair of cells  each consisting of a potato  lemon  et cetera  with two electrodes inserted into it  wired in series to form a battery with enough voltage to power a digital clock  homemade cells of this kind are of no practical use 
a voltaic pile can be made from two coins  such as a nickel and a   and a piece of
dipped in   such a pile generates a very low voltage but  when many are stacked in   they can replace normal batteries for a short time 
has developed a
that generates electricity from sugar in a way that is similar to the processes observed in living organisms  the battery generates electricity through the use of enzymes that break down carbohydrates 
lead acid cells can easily be manufactured at home  but a tedious charge discharge cycle is needed to  form  the plates  this is a process in which lead sulfate forms on the plates  and during charge is converted to lead dioxide  positive plate  and pure lead  negative plate   repeating this process results in a microscopically rough surface  increasing the surface area  increasing the current the cell can deliver 
are easy to make at home 
can be produced with high-purity aluminium 
batteries will produce some electricity  but are not efficient  in part because a significant amount of  combustible 
gas is produced
