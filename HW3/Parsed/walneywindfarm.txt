walney wind farm is an offshore
14km west of
off the coast of   in the     it has a capacity of 367mw  which makes it one of the world s largest offshore wind farms  the wind farm was developed by walney  uk  offshore windfarms limited  a partnership between
and   the farm is immediately north west of the
and also to the west of   the farm is in water depths ranging from 19m to 23m and covers an area of approximately 73km2

description  
both phases have 51
giving a
of 367  until september 2012 it was the world s largest operational offshore wind farm  it is expected to generate about 1,300gwh year of electricity  with a load factor of 43 
construction  
in 2004 dong energy was awarded a 50-year lease from
to develop a wind farm off walney island  as part of the second uk offshore wind farm tendering process known as   the farm was constructed sequentially in two phases with overlapping installation activities to reduce the overall construction timeframe 
the project involved constructing the wind turbines and their   building two offshore substations and installing two
power cables  one for each phase  and two short onshore cables to connect to two existing onshore
for connection into the uk   a cable was laid by   phase 1 connects to a substation at
and phase 2 connects to substation at   south of   both undersea cables pass close by   all the construction work was expected to take less than 2 years  with both phases operational by the end of 2011  on 11 july 2011 phase 1 became operational  comprising 51 turbines with an installed capacity of 183.6mw 
walney 2 began sending power to the grid on 1 november 2011  in february 2012  dong energy claimed to have installed the 51 turbines in walney 2 in 5 months and 14 days  including monopiles and complete turbines  about 3.25 days per turbine  walney 1 took 7 months  the improvement is due to commonality of projects and resources  the wind farm was officially opened on 9 february 2012 by the new energy secretary    mp  although the last of the 51 turbines in walney 2 were only activated in april 2012 
walney extension  
in november 2014 dong energy was given development consent for an extension to the walney offshore wind farm  the development consent allowed a maximum of 207 turbines to be added to the existing 102 turbines  the maximum generating capacity of the extension was said to be 750mw although dong was reported to be proceeding with a project based around 660mw  construction is expected to begin in 2017  in 2015 dong chose the 8mw vestas for phase 1  and the 7mw siemens gearless turbine for phase 2 
involvement in oil spill  
in 2014 a dive vessel  owned by danish firm offshore marine services  was carrying out routine inspection work when an anchor cable broke and the ship slammed into one of 102 turbines installed at the walney offshore wind farm  the uks maritime and coastguard agency surveyed the crash site and reported that a surface sheen stretching 33 feet wide and 0.7 nautical miles long was trailing the vessel  the agency said that  unlike heavier crude oil  the marine engine oil should evaporate or disperse naturally

note that the published load factor and expected annual generation do not match well  if the 367-mw wind farm is expected to generate 1,300gwh a year  then load factor is a bit smaller than claimed  around 40
