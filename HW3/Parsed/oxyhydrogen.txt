for producing oxyhydrogen 
oxyhydrogen is a mixture of
 h2  and
 o2  gases  this gaseous mixture is used for torches to process
materials and was the first gaseous mixture used for   theoretically  a ratio of 2 1 hydrogen oxygen is enough to achieve maximum efficiency  in practice a ratio 4 1 or 5 1 is needed to avoid an  
this mixture may also be referred to as knallgas  scandinavian and german    bang-gas    although some authors define knallgas to be a generic term for the mixture of fuel with the precise amount of oxygen required for complete combustion  thus 2 1 oxyhydrogen would be called  hydrogen-knallgas  
brown s gas and hho are
terms for a 2 1 mixture of oxyhydrogen obtained under certain special conditions  its proponents claim that it has special properties

when ignited  the gas mixture converts to

varies  the maximum temperature of about 2,800c  5,100f  is achieved with an exact stoichiometric mixture  about 700c  1,300f  hotter than a hydrogen flame in air  when either of the gases are mixed in excess of this ratio  or when mixed with an
like nitrogen  the heat must spread throughout a greater quantity of matter and the temperature will be lower

was the first to decompose water in this manner in 1800  in theory  the input energy of a closed system will always equal the output energy  as the
states  however  in practice no systems are perfectly closed  and the energy required to generate the oxyhydrogen will always exceed the energy released by combusting it  even at maximum practical efficiency  as the
implies   see   
applications  
used an oxyhydrogen flame as a high-temperature heat source
lighting  
many forms of oxyhydrogen
have been described  such as the   which used an oxyhydrogen flame to heat a piece of
to
  because of the explosiveness of the oxyhydrogen  limelights have been replaced by  
oxyhydrogen blowpipe  
nineteenth-century bellows-operated oxy-hydrogen blowpipe  including two different types of
the oxy-hydrogen
was developed by
and
in the early nineteenth century  it produced a flame hot enough to melt such
materials as       and   and was a valuable tool in several fields of science  it is used in the
to produce synthetic corundum   
oxyhydrogen torch  
an oxyhydrogen torch is an   which burns hydrogen  the   with oxygen  the    it is used for cutting and       and  
due to competition from the acetylene-fueled cutting torch and from arc welding  the oxyhydrogen torch is seldom used today  but it remains the preferred cutting tool in some niche applicationssee  
oxyhydrogen was once used in working
because at the time such a torch was the only device that could attain the temperature required to melt the metal 1,768.3c  3,214.9f   these techniques have been superseded by the  
brown s gas
  
 brown s gas  is oxyhydrogen with a 2 1
of
and
gases  the same proportion as in   it is named after yull brown  who claimed that it could be used as a fuel for the internal combustion engine  it s also called  hho gas  after the claims of fringe physicist   who claims that his hho gas  produced by a special apparatus  is  a new form of water   with new properties  based on his
of    
many other pseudoscientific claims have been made about brown s gas s pretended ability to neutralize radioactive waste  help plants to germinate  etc 
oxyhydrogen is often mentioned in conjunction with   the most common and decisive counter-argument against producing this gas on board to use as a fuel or fuel additive is that more energy is needed to split water molecules than is recouped by burning the resulting gas  additionally  the volume of gas that can be produced for on-demand consumption through electrolysis is very small in comparison to the volume consumed by an internal combustion engine 
an article in
reported that brown s gas does not increase the  
 water-fueled  cars should not be confused with   where the hydrogen is produced elsewhere and used as fuel or where it is used
