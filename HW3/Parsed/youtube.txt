an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube  and concluded that while the system was  surprisingly resilient  in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos  it was not infallible  the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to
in some cases  as the videos have not been checked by a human for   if a youtube user disagrees with a decision by content id  it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision  youtube has cited the effectiveness of content id as one of the reasons why the site s rules were modified in december 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length

we have strict rules on what s allowed  and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly  we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users  given the volume of content uploaded on our site  we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly   july 2008

in 2009 described users  comments on youtube as

posted the question  why the fuck do i need a google  account to comment on a video   on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change  the official youtube announcement received 20,097  thumbs down  votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days  writing in the newsday blog silicon island  chase melvin noted that  google  is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook  but it s essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who don t want to lose their ability to comment on videos  and  discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system   in the same article melvin goes on to say 

perhaps user complaints are justified  but the idea of revamping the old system isn t so bad 
think of the crude  misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation  isn t any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot  the system is far from perfect  but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity
