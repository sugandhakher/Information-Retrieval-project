renewable energy in tuvalu is a growing sector of the country s energy supply 
has committed to becoming the first country to get 100  of its
from
sources by 2020  this is considered possible because of the small size of the population of tuvalu and its abundant solar energy resources due to its tropical location  it is somewhat complicated because tuvalu consists of nine inhabited islands  the tuvalu national energy policy  tnep  was formulated in 2009  and the energy strategic action plan defines and directs current and future energy developments so that tuvalu can achieve the ambitious target of
for power generation by 2020  the program is expected to cost 20 million us dollars and is supported by the e8  a group of 10 electric companies from
countries  the government of tuvalu worked with the e8 group to develop the tuvalu solar power project  which is a 40kw grid-connected solar system that is intended to provide about 5  of s peak demand  and 3  of the tuvalu electricity corporation s annual household consumption 
tuvalu participates in the
 aosis   which is a coalition of small island and low-lying coastal countries that have concerns about their vulnerability to the adverse effects of global climate change  under the   which was signed on 5 september 2013  tuvalu has commitment to implement power generation of 100  renewable energy  between 2013 and 2020   which is proposed to be implemented using solar pv  95  of demand  and biodiesel  5  of demand   the feasibility of wind power generation will be considered  in november 2015 tuvalu committed to reduction of emissions of green-house gases from the electricity generation  power  sector to almost zero emissions by 2025

tuvalu s carbon footprint  
tuvalu s power has come from electricity generation facilities that use imported diesel brought in by ships  the tuvalu electricity corporation  tec  on the main island of
operates the large power station  2000kw  
funafuti s power station comprises three 750kva diesel generators with 11kv operating voltage  which was installed in 2007  total power output is 1,800kw  the old generators have remained offline  1920kw  but are available as back-up to the main system  the cost of diesel is subsidised by approximately 40  of the annual fuel consumption through the japan non project grant assistance  npga   although this subsidy may end  which will expose the true cost of diesel generation of electricity 
seven of the eight outer islands are powered by 48 - 80kw each diesel generators with a total generating capacity per island averaging 176kw  although vaitupu generates 208kw and nukulaelae generates 144kw  niulakita operates individual dc home solar systems  in the other islands the diesel generators are run for 1218 hours per day  for the small power stations on the outlying islands  fuel has to be transferred to 200 liter  55 gallon  barrels and offloaded from the ships  a small project to power the inter-island telecommunications systems by photovoltaics began in 1979 but was mismanaged 
a project installed hundreds of small household solar systems as well as solar powered medical refrigerators beginning in the early 1980s but poor training and management led to installation and maintenance problems 
tuvalu  barely above sea level at any point  is concerned over
and
and see its use of renewable energy as a moral example for others whose influence is greater    tuvalu s minister for public utilities and industries in the
stated this as  we thank those who are helping tuvalu reduce its carbon footprint as it will strengthen our voice in upcoming international negotiations  and we look forward to the day when our nation offers an example to all -- powered entirely by natural resources such as the sun and the wind

tuvalu energy sector development project  esdp   
in 2014 the tuvalu electricity corporation  tec  began implementing a master plan for renewable energy and energy efficiency  mpreee  through the tuvalu energy sector development project  esdp   which builds on the tuvalu national energy policy  2009 
commitment under the majuro declaration 2013  
the
led by
made a commitment under the   which was signed on 5 september 2013  to implement power generation of 100  renewable energy  between 2013 and 2020   this commitment is proposed to be implemented using solar pv  95  of demand  and biodiesel  5  of demand   the feasibility of wind power generation will be considered 
commitment under the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  1994  
on 27 november 2015 the government of tuvalu announced its intended nationally determined contributions  ndcs  in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases  ghgs  under provisions of the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc   which became effective on 21 march 1994 

tuvalu commits to reduction of emissions of green-house gases from the electricity generation  power  sector  by 100   ie almost zero emissions by 2025 


tuvalus indicative quantified economy-wide target for a reduction in total emissions of ghgs from the entire energy sector to 60  below 2010 levels by 2025 


these emissions will be further reduced from the other key sectors  agriculture and waste  conditional upon the necessary technology and finance 


these targets go beyond the targets enunciated in tuvalus national energy policy  nep  and the majuro declaration on climate leadership  2013   currently  50  of electricity is derived from renewables  mainly solar  and this figure will rise to 75  by 2020 and 100  by 2025  this would mean almost zero use of fossil fuel for power generation  this is also in line with our ambition to keep the warming to less than 1.5c  if there is a chance to save atoll nations like tuvalu 

solar energy  
in 2007  tuvalu was getting 2  of its energy from solar  through 400 small systems managed by the tuvalu solar electric co-operative society  these were installed beginning in 1984 and  in the late 1990s  34  of families in the outer islands had a pv system  which generally powered 1-3 lights and perhaps a few hours a day of radio use   each of the eight islands had a medical center with a pv-powered vaccine refrigerator and each island s solar technician had a larger pv system which ran a household refrigerator  followup on the installations showed no deterioration of the pv panels but switches and light fixtures had suffered damage or failed from the salt air 
the implementation of the tuvalu solar power project in 2008-9  involved the installation of a 40kw grid-connected solar system that is intended to provide about 5  of s peak demand  and 3  of tecs annual household consumption  the first large scale system in tuvalu was a 40kw
installation on the roof of   this grid-connected 40kw solar system was established in 2008 by the e8 and japan government through kansai electric company  japan  and contributes 1  of electricity production on funafuti  future plans include expanding this plant to 60kw 
a 46kw solar installation with battery storage at the
on
island was brought online on 27 november 2009  at the date of installation it was described as the largest diesel-solar photovoltaic  pv  hybrid electricity system in the south pacific  prior to the installment of the system the residential school relied upon a diesel powered generator  which needed to be turned off during the night  the hybrid system systems saves thousands of dollars in diesel costs and provides the school with a 24-hour supply of energy  with up to 200kw per day 
funding for further pv solar system grid-tied systems was announced in late 2011 for funafuti  with the funding provided by the pacific environment community  pec  fund  in 2015 a new zealand aid programme resulted in solarcity and infratec renewables  two new zealand companies  installing photovoltaic panels on government buildings on funafuti  these pv panels are expected to generate 170kw of electricity and are estimated to deliver 5 percent of the energy requirements for funafuti and will reduce tuvalu s dependence on diesel by up to 62,000 litres 
a non-profit  alofa tuvalu  is promoting
and
as well as investigating producing  
and ethanol 
in january 2014 tuvalu signed an agreement with masdar  a
government company  which will provided us 3 million in aid to help tuvalu solarize the outer islands  so as to reduce reliance on fossil fuel for electricity generation 
in 2014
and the
agreed to provide finance to the government of tuvalu to install battery-backed solar photovoltaic  pv  systems on the outer islands  the 191kwp project will provide the islands with 24 hours-a-day electricity and allow tuvalu to save up to 120,000 litres of diesel per year  which will amount to a reduction in spending on diesel of about au 200,000 per year  this project will result in the construction of four small scale solar-hybrid systems that are to be located on    
and   from january to march 2015 powersmart  a new zealand company  implemented german solar power technology to build the new vaitupu powerhouse  with the next solar-hybrid system being built on nanumaga in september  the 2015 installation program continued with nanumea in october and niutao in november 
wind energy  
is also mentioned as a future electricity source  tuvalu s commitment  as part of the   is to implement power generation of 100  renewable energy  between 2013 and 2020   the feasibility of wind power generation will be considered as part of this commitment
