history
early experiments
experiment inspired later  
one of the first known experiments on the relationship between
and air was conducted by the 2nd centurybce
writer on mechanics    in his work pneumatica  philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel s neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck  philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the
and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass  many centuries later
built on philo s work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and  
oxygen was discovered by the
alchemist   who considered it the  
in the late 17thcentury 
proved that air is necessary for combustion  english chemist
 16411679  refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus  in one experiment  he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air s volume before extinguishing the subjects  from this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion 
mayow observed that
increased in weight when heated  and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it  he also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body  accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work tractatus duo in the tract  de respiratione  
phlogiston theory
main article 
helped develop and popularize the phlogiston theory 
      and    all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a   this may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of
and
called the phlogiston theory  which was then the favored explanation of those processes 
established in 1667 by the german alchemist   and modified by the chemist
by 1731  phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts  one part  called phlogiston  was given off when the substance containing it was burned  while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form  or  
highly combustible materials that leave little   such as wood or coal  were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston  non-combustible substances that corrode  such as iron  contained very little  air did not play a role in phlogiston theory  nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea  instead  it was based on observations of what happens when something burns  that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process  the fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products 
this theory  while it was on the right track  was unfortunately set up backwards  rather than combustion or corrosion occurring as a result of the decomposition of phlogiston compounds into their base elements with the phlogiston being lost to the air  it is in fact the result of oxygen from the air combining with the base elements to produce oxides  indeed  one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals gain weight in rusting  when they were supposedly losing phlogiston  
discovery
beat priestley to the discovery but published afterwards 
oxygen was first discovered by
pharmacist   he had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various
by about 1772  scheele called the gas  fire air  because it was the only known supporter of combustion  and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled treatise on air and fire  which he sent to his publisher in 1775  that document was published in 1777 
is usually given priority in the discovery 
in the meantime  on august 1  1774  an experiment conducted by the british clergyman
focused sunlight on
 hgo  inside a glass tube  which liberated a gas he named  dephlogisticated air   he noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it  after breathing the gas himself  he wrote   the feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air  but i fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards   priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled  an account of further discoveries in air  which was included in the second volume of his book titled   because he published his findings first  priestley is usually given priority in the discovery 
the french chemist
later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently  priestley visited lavoisier in october 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas  scheele also posted a letter to lavoisier on september 30  1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance  but lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it  a copy of the letter was found in scheele s belongings after his death  
lavoisier s contribution
what lavoisier did  although this was disputed at the time  was to conduct the first adequate quantitative experiments on
and give the first correct explanation of how combustion works  he used these and similar experiments  all started in 1774  to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by priestley and scheele was a  
discredited the phlogiston theory 
in one experiment  lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when
and air were heated in a closed container  he noted that air rushed in when he opened the container  which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed  he also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in  this and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book sur la combustion en gnral  which was published in 1777  in that work  he proved that air is a mixture of two gases   vital air   which is essential to combustion and respiration  and azote  gk    lifeless    which did not support either  azote later became
in english  although it has kept the name in french and several other european languages 
lavoisier renamed  vital air  to oxygne in 1777 from the
roots   oxys     literally  sharp   from the taste of acids  and -  -gens   producer  literally begetter   because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids  chemists  such as sir
in 1812  eventually determined that lavoisier was wrong in this regard  hydrogen forms the basis for acid chemistry   but by then the name was too well established 
oxygen entered the english language despite opposition by english scientists and the fact that the englishman priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it  this is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled  oxygen  in the popular book
 1791  by   grandfather of  
later history
and a liquid oxygen-gasoline
 s original
presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another  for example  dalton assumed that water s formula was ho  giving the
of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen  instead of the modern value of about 16  in 1805 
and
showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen  and by 1811
had arrived at the correct interpretation of water s composition  based on what is now called
and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases 
by the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it  using a
method  swiss chemist and physicist
liquid
in order to liquefy carbon dioxide  which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it  he sent a telegram on december 22  1877 to the
in paris announcing his discovery of   just two days later  french physicist
announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen  only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted  oxygen was liquified in a stable state for the first time on march 29  1883 by polish scientists from  
and  
in 1891 scottish chemist
was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study  the first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by german engineer
and british engineer william hampson  both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then
the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them  later  in 1901  oxyacetylene
was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of
and compressed o
2  this method of welding and cutting metal later became common 
in 1923  the american scientist
became the first person to develop a
that burned liquid fuel  the engine used
for fuel and liquid oxygen as the   goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56m at 97km h on march 16  1926 in   us 
oxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally  possibly because of fossil-fuel burning

properties and molecular structure

o

as dioxygen  two oxygen atoms are
to each other  the bond can be variously described based on level of theory  but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent
that results from the filling of
formed from the
of the individual oxygen atoms  the filling of which results in a
of two  more specifically  the double bond is the result of sequential  low-to-high energy  or   filling of orbitals  and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons  after sequential filling of the low  and   orbitals   overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the o-o molecular axis and  overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the o-o molecular axis  and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest  and   orbitals 
this combination of cancellations and  and  overlaps results in dioxygen s double bond character and reactivity  and a triplet electronic   an

2 are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods  the most common method is
of liquefied air  with n
2
as a vapor while o
2 is left as a liquid 
the other primary method of producing o
2 is passing a stream of clean  dry air through one bed of a pair of identical
molecular sieves  which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 to93  o
2  simultaneously  nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed  by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it  in the reverse direction of flow  after a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged  thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline  this is known as   oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non- technologies  see also the related   
oxygen gas can also be produced through
into molecular oxygen and hydrogen  dc electricity must be used  if ac is used  the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2 1  contrary to popular belief  the 2 1 ratio observed in the dc electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is h2o unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves  a similar method is the electrocatalytic o
2 evolution from oxides and   chemical catalysts can be used as well  such as in
or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines  and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies  another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through
membranes based on
by either high pressure or an electric current  to produce nearly pure o
2 gas 
in large quantities  the price of liquid oxygen in 2001 was approximately  0.21 kg  since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air  the production cost will change as energy cost varies 
storage
methods include high pressure   cryogenics and chemical compounds  for reasons of economy  oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers  since one
of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20c  68f   such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers  which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas  liquid oxygen is passed through   which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building  oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas  a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and  
applications

that cause gas gangrene  so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them  decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive  resulting in bubbles of inert gas  mostly nitrogen and helium  forming in the blood  increasing the pressure of o
2 as soon as possible helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs 
oxygen is also used medically for patients who require   often at concentrations above the 21  found in ambient air

an application of o
2 as a low-pressure
is in modern   which surround their occupant s body with pressurized air  these devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one third normal pressure  resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of o

also rely on artificially delivered o

2 use in diving at higher-than-sea-level pressures is usually limited to rebreather  decompression  or emergency treatment use at relatively shallow depths   6 meters depth  or less   deeper diving requires significant dilution of o

oxygen  as a supposed mild   has a history of recreational use in
and in   oxygen bars are establishments found in japan    and  
since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal o

effect is a more likely explanation  available studies support a performance boost from enriched o

toxicity
main article 
main symptoms of oxygen toxicity
oxygen toxicity occurs when the lungs take in 212 higher than normal o
2 partial pressure  which can occur in deep  
oxygen gas  o
2  can be
at elevated   leading to
and other health problems  oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilo kpa   equal to about 50  oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level o
2 partial pressure of about 21kpa  this is not a problem except for patients on   since gas supplied through
in medical applications is typically composed of only 30 50  o
2 by volume  about 30kpa at standard pressure    although this figure also is subject to wide variation  depending on type of mask  
at one time 
were placed in incubators containing o
2-rich air  but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high 
breathing pure o
2 in space applications  such as in some modern space suits  or in early spacecraft such as   causes no damage due to the low total pressures used  in the case of spacesuits  the o
2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is  in general  about 30kpa  1.4 times normal   and the resulting o
2 partial pressure in the astronaut s arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level o
2 partial pressure  for more information on this  see
and   
oxygen toxicity to the lungs and
can also occur in deep
and   prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o
2 partial pressure more than 60kpa can eventually lead to permanent   exposure to a o
2 partial pressures greater than 160kpa  about 1.6 atm  may lead to convulsions  normally fatal for divers   acute oxygen toxicity  causing seizures  its most feared effect for divers  can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21  o
2 at 66m  217ft  or more of depth  the same thing can occur by breathing 100  o
2 at only 6m  20ft  
combustion and other hazards
the interior of the
command module  pure o
2 at higher than normal pressure and a spark led to a fire and the loss of the
crew 
highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion 
and
hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and
are brought into close proximity  an ignition event  such as heat or a spark  is needed to trigger combustion  oxygen is the oxidant  not the fuel  but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion  combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential  such as         and
because they can donate oxygen to a fire 
concentrated o
2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically 
pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and
will act as a fuel  and therefore the design and manufacture of o
2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized  the fire that killed the
crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure o
2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure  instead of the 13 normal pressure that would be used in a mission 
liquid oxygen spills  if allowed to soak into organic matter  such as     and
can cause these materials to
unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact  as with other
liquids  on contact with the human body it can cause
to the skin and the eyes

notes
these results were mostly ignored until 1860  part of this rejection was due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no
towards atoms of the same element  and part was due to apparent exceptions to avogadro s law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules

the reason is that increasing the proportion of oxygen in the breathing gas at low pressure acts to augment the inspired o
2 partial pressure nearer to that found at sea-level 
also  since oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen  the charge difference makes it a   the interactions between the different
of each molecule cause a net attraction force 
since o
2 s partial pressure is the fraction of o
2 times the total pressure  elevated partial pressures can occur either from high o
2 fraction in breathing gas or from high breathing gas pressure  or a combination of both 
no single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified  although some evidence points to arc from an electrical spark
