emissions 
an energy crop is a
grown as a low-cost and low-maintenance
used to make   such as   or combusted for its energy content to generate electricity or heat  energy
are generally categorized as woody or
plants  many of the latter are grasses    
commercial energy crops are typically densely planted  high-yielding crop species  processed to bio-fuel and burnt to generate power  woody crops such as
or
are widely utilised  as well as temperate grasses such as
and
 both known as elephant grass   if carbohydrate content is desired for the production of   whole-crops such as      
and many others  can be made into silage and then converted into biogas 
through
and application of
plants can be manipulated to create greater yields  reduce associated costs and require less water  however  high energy yield can be realized with existing cultivars  250

by state  
solid biomass  
elephant grass    is an experimental energy crop
 note  the terms biofuel  biomass  and so on  are often used interchangeably  
energy generated by burning plants grown for the purpose  often after the dry matter is   energy crops are used for firing power plants  either alone or co-fired with other fuels  alternatively they may be used for heat or
 chp  production 
to cover the increasing requirements of woody biomass 
 src  were applied to agricultural sites  within this cropping systems fast growing tree species like
and
are planted in growing cycles of three to five years  the cultivation of this cultures is dependent on wet soil conditions and could be an alternative for moist field sieds  however  an influence on local water conditions could not be excluded  this indicates that an establishment should exclude the vicinity to vulnarable
ecosystems 
gas biomass  methane   
or biogas plants can be directly supplemented with energy crops once they have been ensiled into   the fastest growing sector of german biofarming has been in the area of  renewable energy crops  on nearly 500,000ha  1,200,000 acres  of land  2006   energy crops can also be grown to boost gas yields where feedstocks have a low energy content  such as manures and spoiled grain  it is estimated that the energy yield presently of bioenergy crops converted via silage to methane is about 2   1.81010    small mixed cropping enterprises with animals can use a portion of their acreage to grow and convert energy crops and sustain the entire farms energy requirements with about 1/5 the acreage  in europe and especially germany  however  this rapid growth has occurred only with substantial government support  as in the german bonus system for   similar developments of integrating crop farming and bioenergy production via silage-methane have been almost entirely overlooked in n  america  where political and structural issues and a huge continued push to centralize energy production has overshadowed positive developments   
liquid biomass  
biodiesel  
coconuts sun-dried in  
for making copra  the dried meat  or kernel  of the  
extracted from it has made copra an important agricultural commodity for many coconut-producing countries  it also yields coconut cake which is mainly used as
for livestock 
pure biodiesel  b-100   made from soybeans
european production of
from energy crops has grown steadily in the last decade  principally focused on
used for oil and energy  production of oil biodiesel from rape covers more than 12,000km in germany alone  and has doubled in the past 15 years  typical yield of oil as pure biodiesel may be is 100,000l km2  68,000usgal sqmi  57,000impgal sqmi  or more  making biodiesel crops economically attractive  provided sustainable
exist that are nutrient-balanced and preventative of the spread of disease such as   biodiesel yield of soybeans is significantly lower than that of rape

and   there has been a preoccupation with cellulosic bioethanol in america as the agricultural structure supporting biomethane is absent in many regions  with no credits or bonus system in place    consequently  a lot of private money and investor hopes are being pinned on marketable and patentable innovations in enzyme hydrolysis and the like 
also refers to the technology of using principally corn  maize seed  to make ethanol directly through fermentation  a process that under certain field and process conditions can consume as much energy as is the energy value of the ethanol it produces  therefore being non-sustainable  new developments in converting grain stillage  referred to as distillers grain stillage or dgs  into biogas energy looks promising as a means to improve the poor energy ratio of this type of bioethanol process
