    and
are three emerging renewable sources of energy
global public support for different energy sources  2011  based on a poll by
renewable energy is generally defined as energy that is collected from
which are naturally replenished on a human timescale  such as           and   renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas    air and water heating cooling    and
energy services 
based on  s 2016 report  renewables contributed 19.2  to humans 
and 23.7  to their generation of electricity in 2014 and 2015  respectively  this energy consumption is divided as 8.9  coming from   4.2  as heat energy  modern biomass  geothermal and solar heat   3.9  hydro electricity and 2.2  is electricity from wind  solar  geothermal  and   worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us 286 billion in 2015  with countries like
and the
heavily investing in wind  hydro  solar and biofuels  globally  there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries  with
being the largest renewable employer 
renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas  in contrast to   which are concentrated in a limited number of countries  rapid deployment of renewable energy and
is resulting in significant     and economic benefits  the results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as
 ghg  emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from ghg emissions resulting in climate change  a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies  in international
there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply  national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond  some places and at least two countries  iceland and norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already  and many other countries have the set a goal to reach
in the future  for example  in
the government decided to
 electricity  mobility and heating cooling  to 100  renewable energy by 2050 
while many renewable energy projects are large-scale  renewable technologies are also suited to
and remote areas and   where energy is often crucial in     secretary-general
has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity  as most of renewables provide electricity  renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further   which has several benefits  for example  electricity can be converted to heat without losses and even reach higher temperatures than fossil fuels  can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and is clean at the point of consumpion  in addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements  because most renewables don t have a steam cycle with high losses  fossil power plants usually have losses of 40 to 65

renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as         and   as the
explains 
renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly  in its various forms  it derives directly from the sun  or from heat generated deep within the earth  included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar  wind  ocean    biomass  geothermal resources  and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources 
renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for
exist over wide geographical areas  in contrast to other energy sources  which are concentrated in a limited number of countries  rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency  and technological diversification of energy sources  would result in significant
and economic benefits  it would also reduce environmental
such as
caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health  reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the united states  renewable energy sources  that derive their energy from the sun  either directly or indirectly  such as hydro and wind  are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years  at which point the predicted increase in heat from the
is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist 
and
concerns  coupled with     and increasing government support  are driving increasing renewable energy legislation  incentives and   new government spending  regulation and policies helped the industry weather the
better than many other sectors  according to a 2011 projection by the   solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within 50 years  reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment 
as of 2011  small solar pv systems provide electricity to a few million households  and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more  over 44 million households use
made in household-scale digesters for
and or   and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves    secretary-general
has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply  national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond  and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy  including a 20  target of all electricity generated for the european union by 2020  some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100  renewables  outside europe  a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 20202030 time frame that range from 10  to 50  
renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas         and rural  off-grid  energy services 
power generation
by 2040  renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation  several jurisdictions  including denmark  germany  the state of south australia and some us states have achieved high integration of variable renewables  for example  in 2015 wind power met 42  of electricity demand in denmark  23.2  in portugal and 15.5  in uruguay  interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy  innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions 
heating
makes an important contribution to
in many countries  most notably in china  which now has 70  of the global total  180 gwth   most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 5060 million households in china  worldwide  total installed
systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households  the use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well  in sweden  national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil  direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly  the newest addition to heating is from
which provide both heating and cooling  and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority  see also

history
prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century  nearly all energy used was renewable  almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy  in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires  dates from 790,000 years ago  use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later  sometime between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago  probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water  this practice can be traced back some 7000 years  to ships on the nile  moving into the time of recorded history  the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human       wind  in grain crushing   and   a traditional biomass  a graph of energy use in the united states up until 1900 shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in 1900 as wind and solar played in 2010 
in the 1860s and  70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source  in 1873 professor
wrote 
the time will arrive when the industry of europe will cease to find those natural resources  so necessary for it  petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places  will man  then  return to the power of water and wind  or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all  history will show what will come 
in 1885    commenting on the discovery of the
in the solid state  wrote 
in conclusion  i would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be  its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost  and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten 
mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his   published in 1905 
development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of world war i  the importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911
article   in the far distant future 
having been exhausted  solar power  will remain as the only means of existence of the human race  
the theory of
was published in 1956  in the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual   as well as for an escape from dependence on oil  and the first electricity generating
appeared  solar had long been used for heating and cooling  but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980 
the iea 2014 world energy outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from 1,700 gigawatts in 2014 to 4,550 gigawatts in 2040  fossil fuels received about  550 billion in subsidies in 2013  compared to  120 billion for all renewable energies 
mainstream technologies
wind power

airflows can be used to run   modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600kw to 5 mw of rated power  although turbines with rated output of 1.53 mw have become the most common for commercial use  the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed  so as wind speed increases  power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine  areas where winds are stronger and more constant  such as offshore and high
sites  are preferred locations for wind farms  typically
of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually  but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites 
globally  the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production  or 40 times current electricity demand  assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome  this would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas  particularly in areas of higher wind resources  such as offshore  as offshore wind speeds average  90  greater than that of land  so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines  in 2014 global wind generation was 706 terawatt-hours or 3  of the worlds total electricity 
hydropower
main articles

in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6  of the worlds total electricity and 70  of all renewable electricity  since water is about 800 times   even a slow flowing stream of water  or moderate sea   can yield considerable amounts of energy  there are many forms of water energy 
historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs  which are still popular in third world countries  the largest of which is the  2003  in
and the  1984  built by brazil and paraguay 
systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 mw of power  they are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers  china is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations 
plants derive
from rivers without the creation of a large   this style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity  such as the
on the columbia river in the united states 
hydropower is produced in 150 countries  with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010  for counties having the
of electricity from renewables  the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric  china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010  representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use  there are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 gw  the

across the brazil paraguay border  and
in venezuela 
  which captures the energy of ocean surface waves  and   converting the energy of tides  are two forms of hydropower with future potential  however  they are not yet widely employed commercially  a demonstration project operated by the
on the coast of   and connected to the grid  harnesses tidal power from the   location of world s highest tidal flow    which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters  has currently no economic feasibility

biomass is
derived from living  or recently living organisms  it most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called   as an energy source  biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat  or indirectly after converting it to various forms of   conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into  thermal  chemical  and biochemical methods  wood remains the largest biomass energy source today  examples include forest residues  such as dead trees  branches and
  yard clippings  wood chips and even   in the second sense  biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial   including   industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants  including                   and a variety of tree species  ranging from
to
   
plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy  some examples of these plants are wheat  which typically yield 7.58 tonnes of grain per hectare  and straw  which typically yield 3.55 tonnes per hectare in the uk  the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity  plant biomass can also be degraded from
to
through a series of chemical treatments  and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel 
biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like
gas or transportation fuels like
and   rotting garbage  and agricultural and human waste  all release methane gas also called
or   crops  such as corn and sugarcane  can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel  ethanol  biodiesel  another transportation fuel  can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats  also  biomass to liquids  btls  and cellulosic ethanol are still under research  there is a great deal of research involving
or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it s a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture  such as corn and soy  once harvested  it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol    and methane  as well as biodiesel and   the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region  forest by-products  such as wood residues  are common in the united states  agricultural waste is common in
 sugar cane residue  and
 rice husks   animal husbandry residues  such as poultry litter  are common in the united kingdom

for its potential to provide fuel  along with food and animal feed  in arid parts of asia and africa 
with advanced technology being developed  cellulosic biomass  such as trees and grasses  are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production  ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form  but it is usually used as a
additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions  bioethanol is widely used in the

growth of renewables
global growth of renewables through to 2011
from the end of 2004  worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 1060  annually for many technologies  for wind power and many other renewable technologies  growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years  more wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology  however  grid-connected pv increased the fastest of all renewables technologies  with a 60  annual average growth rate  in 2010  renewable power constituted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities 
projections vary  but scientists have advanced a plan to power 100  of the world s energy with     and
by the year 2030 
according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency  solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within 50 years  reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment  cedric philibert  senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the iea said   photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world s demand for electricity by 2060 and half of all energy needs with wind  hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation    photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity   philibert said 
in 2014 global
capacity expanded 16  to 369,553 mw  yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4  of worldwide electricity usage  11.4  in the eu  and it is widely used in   and the   in 2015  worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 227

for wind in the u s   left  and solar power in europe
renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper  through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition  a 2011 iea report said   a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances  in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support   and added that  cost reductions in critical technologies  such as wind and solar  are set to continue  
hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity  renewable energy costs continue to drop  and the levelised cost of electricity    is declining for wind power  solar photovoltaic     concentrated solar power    and some biomass technologies  renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources  as the cost of renewable power falls  the scope of economically viable applications increases  renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity  where  oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source  e g  on islands  off-grid and in some countries  a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today   a series of studies by the us
modeled the  grid in the western us under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power   in the models  inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of  between  0.47 and  1.28 to each megawatt hour generated   however  the savings in the cost of the fuels saved  adds up to  7 billion  meaning the added costs are  at most  two percent of the savings

with hundreds of megawatts are being built  solar pv is rapidly becoming an inexpensive  low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the sun 
many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built  mainly in europe  china and the usa  the 579mw   in the united states  is the  
many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems  there are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations 
however  when it comes to renewable energy systems and pv  it is not just large systems that matter

geothermal power is cost effective  reliable  sustainable  and environmentally friendly  but has historically been limited to areas near
boundaries  recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources  especially for applications such as home heating  opening a potential for widespread exploitation  geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth  but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels  as a result  geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate
if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels 
the
 iga  has reported that 10,715 mw of geothermal power in 24 countries is online  which is expected to generate 67,246 gwh of electricity in 2010  this represents a 20  increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005  iga projects this will grow to 18,500 mw by 2015  due to the large number of projects presently under consideration  often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource 
in 2010  the united states led the world in
production with 3,086 mw of installed capacity from 77 power plants  the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at   a geothermal field in california  the philippines follows the us as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world  with 1,904 mw of capacity online  geothermal power makes up approximately 18  of the country s electricity generation

use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking
renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics  and affordable only in the affluent developed world  this erroneous view has persisted for many years  but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables  was higher in developing countries  with  156 billion invested  mainly in china  india  and brazil 
renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries  in rural and remote areas  transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive  producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative 
technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power  the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don t have access to grid electricity  even though they are typically very poor  these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps  solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene  as of 2010  an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar pv systems  kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita  more than 30,000 very small solar panels  each producing 12 to 30 watts  are sold in kenya annually  some
 sids  are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability 
micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power  over 44 million households use
made in household-scale digesters for
and or   and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves  clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world  alcohol fuels  ethanol and methanol  can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary  starchy  and cellulostic feedstocks  project gaia  inc  and cleanstar mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in ethiopia  kenya  nigeria and mozambique 
renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to
by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment  renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking  space heating  and lighting  renewable energy can also contribute to education  by providing electricity to schools

many national  state  and local governments have also created   a green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies  green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy 
the military has also focused on the use of
for military vehicles  unlike fossil fuels  renewable fuels can be produced in any country  creating a strategic advantage  the us military has already committed itself to have 50  of its energy consumption come from alternative sources 
the
 irena  is an
for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide  it aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate
and technology transfer  irena was formed on 26 january 2009  by 75countries signing the charter of irena  as of march 2010  irena has 143member states who all are considered as founding members  of which 14 have also ratified the statute 
as of 2011  119 countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy  national targets now exist in at least 98 countries  there is also a wide range of policies at state provincial and local levels 
united nations  secretary-general
has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity  in october 2011  he  announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access  energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy  the group is to be co-chaired by kandeh yumkella  the chair of un energy and director general of the un industrial development organisation  and charles holliday  chairman of bank of america  
100  renewable energy
main article 
the incentive to use 100  renewable energy  for electricity  transport  or even total primary energy supply globally  has been motivated by
and other ecological as well as economic concerns  the
has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand 
has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply  also  professors s  pacala and
have developed a series of    that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change  and  renewable energy sources   in aggregate  constitute the largest number of their  wedges  
using 100  renewable energy was first suggested in a
paper published in 1975 by danish physicist   it was followed by several other proposals  until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published  these were followed by the first detailed 100  scenarios  in 2006 a phd thesis was published by czisch in which it was shown that in a 100  renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in europa and north africa  in the same year danish energy professor
published a first paper in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables  which was followed by several other papers on the
to 100  renewable energy in denmark  since then lund has been publishing several papers on 100  renewable energy  after 2009 publications began to rise steeply  covering 100  scenarios for countries in europa  america  australia and other parts of the world 
in 2011   professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university  and mark delucchi published a study on 100  renewable global energy supply in the journal   they found producing all new energy with     and
by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050  barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be  primarily social and political  not technological or economic   they also found that energy costs with a wind  solar  water system should be similar to today s energy costs 
similarly  in the united states  the independent national research council has noted that  sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change  energy security  and the escalation of energy costs  renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states  taken collectively  can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand    
the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological  according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report  which reviewed many international studies  the key roadblocks are    the   political inaction  unsustainable energy consumption  outdated energy infrastructure  and financial constraints 
emerging technologies
other renewable energy technologies are still under development  and include  
geothermal power  and   these technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization  many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies  but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research  development and demonstration  rd d  funding 
there are numerous organizations within the academic  federal  and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy  this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum  most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields  multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years  two of the most prominent of these labs are
and the
 nrel   both of which are funded by the
and supported by various corporate partners  sandia has a total budget of  2.4 billion while nrel has a budget of  375 million

floating solar arrays
are pv systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs  quarry lakes  irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds  a small number of such systems exist in france  india  japan  south korea  the united kingdom  singapore and the united states  the systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land  the cost of land is more expensive  and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation  unlike most land-based solar plants  floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view  they achieve higher efficiencies than pv panels on land  because water cools the panels  the panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion  in may 2008  the far niente winery in oakville  california  pioneered the world s first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar pv modules with a total capacity of 477kw onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery s irrigation pond  utility-scale floating pv farms are starting to be built

a
is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a  heat sink   heat pumps are designed to move
opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one  a solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a

in a single integrated system  typically these two technologies are used separately  or only placing them in parallel  to produce   in this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump s evaporator  the goal of this system is to get high
and then produce energy in a more
and less expensive way 
it is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel  sheet and tubes  roll-bond  heat pipe  thermal plates  or
      in combination with the heat pump  the use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the

artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including
to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol  researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum  employ catalytic systems made from abundant  inexpensive materials that are robust  readily repaired  non-toxic  stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds  i e   carbohydrates  rather than building and sustaining living cells   however  prominent research faces hurdles  sun catalytix a mit spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012  because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight 
producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic  various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands

because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric   t
carbon-neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy   alleviating the problems of wind and solar   and they enable distribution of wind  water  and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines  nighttime
is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the
for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  so  the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative  germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts

debate
main articles      and
renewable electricity production  from sources such as wind power and solar power  is sometimes criticized for being variable or   but is not true for concentrated solar  geothermal and biofuels  that have continuity  in any case  the
has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and  through local generation  contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks 
there have been  not in my back yard     concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some   with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction  in the usa  the massachusetts
project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns  however  residents in other areas have been more positive  according to a town councilor  the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the
in scotland has enhanced the area 
a recent uk government document states that  projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities  this means giving communities both a say and a stake   in countries such as germany and denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities  particularly through
structures  and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment 
the market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow 
concerns and increasing in   coupled with     oil wars    promotion of
and renewable electricity  nuclear disasters and increasing government support  are driving increasing renewable energy legislation  incentives and   new government spending  regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors
