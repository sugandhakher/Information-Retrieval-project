 dc  sources  such as from batteries  motor vehicles or rectifiers  or by
 ac  sources  such as from the power grid 
or generators  small motors may be found in electric watches  general-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use  the largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion  pipeline compression and
applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts  electric motors may be classified by electric power source type  internal construction  application  type of motion output  and so on 
electric motors are used to produce linear or rotary force     and should be distinguished from devices such as magnetic solenoids and loudspeakers that convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical powers  which are respectively referred to as actuators and transducers

early motors  
faraday s electromagnetic experiment  1821
perhaps the first electric motors were simple
devices created by the scottish monk
in the 1740s  the theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field    was discovered later by
in 1820  the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by
means was demonstrated by the british scientist
in 1821  a free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury  on which a
was placed  when a current was passed through the wire  the wire rotated around the magnet  showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire  this motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments 
substituting for toxic mercury  though
was an early refinement to this faraday demonstration  these and similar
were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century 
 s  electromagnetic self-rotor   1827  museum of applied arts  budapest   the historic motor still works perfectly today 
in 1827 
started experimenting with   after jedlik solved the technical problems of the continuous rotation with the invention of the   he called his early devices  electromagnetic self-rotors   although they were used only for instructional purposes  in 1828 jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical dc motors  the  
and commutator  the device employed no permanent magnets  as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings 
success with dc motors  
after many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus the prussian
created the first real rotating electric motor in may 1834 that actually developed a remarkable mechanical output power  his motor set a world record which was improved only four years later in september 1838 by jacobi himself  his second motor was powerful enough to drive a boat with 14 people across a wide river  it was not until 1839/40 that other developers worldwide managed to build motors of similar and later also of higher performance 
the first commutator dc electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the british scientist
in 1832  following sturgeon s work  a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made with the intention of commercial use was built by the american inventor   which he patented in 1837  the motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute  and powered machine tools and a printing press  due to the high cost of   the motors were commercially unsuccessful and davenport went bankrupt  several inventors followed sturgeon in the development of dc motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues  no
had been developed at the time  like sturgeon s motor  there was no practical commercial market for these motors 
in 1855  jedlik built a device using similar principles to those used in his electromagnetic self-rotors that was capable of useful work  he built a model
that same year 
a major turning point in the development of dc machines took place in 1864  when
described for the first time the ring armature with its symmetrically grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a commutator  the brushes of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current  the first commercially successful dc motors followed the invention by
who  in 1871  reinvented pacinotti s design  in 1873  gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor  which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in vienna and philadelphia by connecting two such dc motors at a distance of up to 2km away from each other  one as a generator   see also
  
in 1886 
invented the first practical dc motor  a non-sparking motor that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads  other sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution  prior work done while employed by    allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid  provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole  and provided controls systems for electric operations  this allowed sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 188788 in richmond va  the electric elevator and control system in 1892  and the electric subway with independently powered centrally controlled cars  which were first installed in 1892 in chicago by the
where it became popularly known as the  l   sprague s motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry  while almost simultaneously another great inventor was developing its primary competitor  which would become much more widespread  the development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of a relatively small air gap between rotor and stator  efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap 
the   long used in classrooms to illustrate motor principles  is extremely inefficient for the same reason  as well as appearing nothing like a modern motor 
application of electric motors revolutionized industry  industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts  belts  compressed air or hydraulic pressure  instead every machine could be equipped with its own electric motor  providing easy control at the point of use  and improving power transmission efficiency  electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water  household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience  comfort and safety possible  today  electric motors stand for more than half of the electric energy consumption in the us 
emergence of ac motors  
in 1824  the french physicist
formulated the existence of   termed   which  by manually turning switches on and off  walter baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive  
in the 1880s  many inventors were trying to develop workable ac motors because ac s advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on ac  the first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by
and   a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887  in 1888  the royal academy of science of turin published ferraris s research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that  the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor  
in 1888  tesla presented his paper a new system for alternating current motors and transformers to the
that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types  one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting   another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting   and the third a true
with separately excited dc supply to rotor winding 
one of the patents tesla filed in 1887  however  also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor 
promptly bought tesla s patents  employed tesla to develop them  and assigned
to help tesla  however  tesla left for other pursuits in 1889  the constant speed ac induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars  but westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in telluride  colorado in 1891 
steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development 
invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb
in 1890  this type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications  however  he claimed that tesla s motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations  which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work  although westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893  these early westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until
developed a rotating bar winding rotor 
the
began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891  by 1896  general electric and westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design  later called the   induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100
induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 hp motor in 1897 
motor construction  
electric motor rotor  left  and stator  right 
rotor  
main article 
in an electric motor the moving part is the rotor which turns the shaft to deliver the mechanical power  the rotor usually has conductors laid into it which carry currents that interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft  however  some rotors carry permanent magnets  and the stator holds the conductors 
stator  
main article 
the stator is the stationary part of the motors electromagnetic circuit and usually consists of either windings or permanent magnets  the stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets  called laminations  laminations are used to reduce energy losses that would result if a solid core were used 
air gap  
the distance between the rotor and stator is called the air gap  the air gap has important effects  and is generally as small as possible  as a large gap has a strong negative effect on the performance of an electric motor  it is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate the air gap increases the magnetizing current needed  for this reason air gap should be minimum   very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses 
salient-pole rotor
windings  
main article 
windings are wires that are laid in coils  usually wrapped around a laminated soft iron
so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current 
electric machines come in two basic magnet field pole configurations  salient-pole machine and nonsalient-pole machine  in the salient-pole machine the pole s magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face  in the nonsalient-pole  or distributed field  or round-rotor  machine  the winding is distributed in pole face slots  a
has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole 
some motors have conductors which consist of thicker metal  such as bars or sheets of metal  usually   although sometimes
is used  these are usually powered by  
commutator  
main article 
a toy s small dc motor with its commutator
a
is a mechanism used to
the input of most dc machines and certain ac machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated from each other and from the electric motor s shaft  the motor s armature current is supplied through the stationary
in contact with the revolving commutator  which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the
rotates from pole to pole  in absence of such current reversal  the motor would brake to a stop  in light of significant advances in the past few decades due to improved technologies in electronic controller  sensorless control  induction motor  and permanent magnet motor fields  electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by externally commutated induction and  
motor supply and control  
motor supply  
a dc motor is usually supplied through slip ring commutator as described above  ac motors  commutation can be either slip ring commutator or externally commutated type  can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type  and can be synchronous or asynchronous type 
can run on either ac or dc 
motor control  
fixed-speed controlled ac motors are provided with direct-on-line or soft-start starters 
variable speed controlled ac motors are provided with a range of different  
or electronic commutator technologies 
the term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated
and
applications 
major categories  
electric motors operate on three different physical principles   
and   by far the most common is magnetic 
in magnetic motors  magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator  the product between these two fields gives rise to a force  and thus a torque on the motor shaft  one  or both  of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor  this is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time  or varying the strength of the pole 
the main types are dc motors and ac motors  the former increasingly being displaced by the latter   
ac electric motors are either asynchronous or synchronous 
once started  a synchronous motor requires synchronism with the moving magnetic field s synchronous speed for all normal torque conditions 
in synchronous machines  the magnetic field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets 
a
motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower  0.746kw   or is manufactured with a standard frame size smaller than a standard 1 hp motor  many household and industrial motors are in the fractional horsepower class

self-commutated motor

all self-commutated dc motors are by definition run on dc electric power  most dc motors are small pm types  they contain a
internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings  current in synchronism with rotation 
electrically excited dc motor  
main article 
workings of a brushed electric motor with a two-pole rotor and pm stator    n  and  s  designate polarities on the inside faces of the magnets  the outside faces have opposite polarities  
a commutated dc motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an
mounted on a rotating shaft  the shaft also carries the commutator  a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates  thus  every brushed dc motor has ac flowing through its rotating windings  current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator  the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature 
the rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated 
ferromagnetic core  current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature  making it a temporary magnet  an    the magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either pms or another winding  a field coil   as part of the motor frame  the force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft  the commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns  keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field  so that the rotor never stops  like a compass needle does   but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied 
many of the limitations of the classic commutator dc motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator  this creates friction  sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections  depending on the commutator design  this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections  and hence coil ends  momentarily while crossing the gaps  furthermore  the
of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened  increasing the sparking of the brushes  this sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine  as too-rapid sparking will overheat  erode  or even melt the commutator  the current density per unit area of the brushes  in combination with their   limits the output of the motor  the making and breaking of electric contact also generates   sparking generates   brushes eventually wear out and require replacement  and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance  on larger motors  or replacement  on small motors   the commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element  requiring precision assembly of many parts  on small motors  the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor  so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor 
while most commutators are cylindrical  some are flat discs consisting of several segments  typically  at least three  mounted on an insulator 
large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output  but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking   small brushes are also desirable for lower cost   stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed  but at the cost of greater friction losses  lower efficiency  and accelerated brush and commutator wear  therefore  dc motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power  speed  and efficiency wear 
dc machines are defined as follows 
armature circuit - a winding where the load current is carried  such that can be either stationary or rotating part of motor or generator 
field circuit - a set of windings that produces a magnetic field so that the electromagnetic induction can take place in electric machines 
commutation  a mechanical technique in which rectification can be achieved  or from which dc can be derived  in dc machines

pm dc motor  not shown

permanent magnet dc motor  
main article 
a pm motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame  instead relying on pms to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque  compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load  because this field is fixed  it cannot be adjusted for speed control  pm fields  stators  are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding  most larger dc motors are of the  dynamo  type  which have stator windings  historically  pms could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled  field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux  however  large pms are costly  as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble  this favors wound fields for large machines 
to minimize overall weight and size  miniature pm motors may use high energy magnets made with
or other strategic elements  most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy  with their higher flux density  electric machines with high-energy pms are at least competitive with all optimally designed
synchronous and induction electric machines  miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration  except that they have at least three rotor poles  to ensure starting  regardless of rotor position  and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets

brushless dc motor  
main article 
some of the problems of the brushed dc motor are eliminated in the bldc design  in this motor  the mechanical  rotating switch  or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor s position  bldc motors are typically 8590  efficient or more  efficiency for a bldc motor of up to 96.5  have been reported  whereas dc motors with brushgear are typically 7580  efficient 
the bldc motor s characteristic trapezoidal back-emf waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed  and partly from the placement of the rotor s pms  also known as electronically commutated dc or inside out dc motors  the stator windings of trapezoidal bldc motors can be with single-phase  two-phase or three-phase and use
mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost
of the electronic commutator 
bldc motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary  as in computer disk drives or in video cassette recorders  the spindles within cd  cd-rom  etc   drives  and mechanisms within office products such as fans  laser printers and photocopiers  they have several advantages over conventional motors 
compared to ac fans using shaded-pole motors  they are very efficient  running much cooler than the equivalent ac motors  this cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan s bearings 
without a commutator to wear out  the life of a bldc motor can be significantly longer compared to a dc motor using brushes and a commutator  commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and rf noise  without a commutator or brushes  a bldc motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers 
the same hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also provide a convenient
signal for closed-loop control  servo-controlled  applications  in fans  the tachometer signal can be used to derive a  fan ok  signal as well as provide running speed feedback 
the motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external clock  leading to precise speed control 
bldc motors have no chance of sparking  unlike brushed motors  making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels  also  sparking generates ozone which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings risking harm to occupants  health 
bldc motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to get rid of unwanted heat 
they are also acoustically very quiet motors which is an advantage if being used in equipment that is affected by vibrations 
modern bldc motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts  larger bldc motors up to about 100kw rating are used in electric vehicles  they also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft 
switched reluctance motor  
6/4 pole switched reluctance motor
main article 
the srm has no brushes or pms  and the rotor has no electric currents  instead  torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator  the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator  while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field 
the magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic reluctance  meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator  thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque  as the rotor turns  different windings will be energized  keeping the rotor turning 
srms are now being used in some appliances 
universal ac-dc motor  
main article 
modern low-cost universal motor  from a vacuum cleaner  field windings are dark copper-colored  toward the back  on both sides  the rotor s laminated core is gray metallic  with dark slots for winding the coils  the commutator  partly hidden  has become dark from use  it is toward the front  the large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes  both sides   as well as the front motor bearing 
a commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on ac or dc power  a universal motor can operate well on ac because the current in both the field and the armature coils  and hence the resultant magnetic fields  will alternate  reverse polarity  in synchronism  and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation 
operating at normal   universal motors are often found in a range less than 1000 watts  universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in   in this application  the use of ac to power a motor originally designed to run on dc would lead to efficiency losses due to
heating of their magnetic components  particularly the motor field pole-pieces that  for dc  would have used solid  un-laminated  iron and they are now rarely used 
an advantage of the universal motor is that ac supplies may be used on motors which have some characteristics more common in dc motors  specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used  the negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator  such motors are used in devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently  and often have high starting-torque demands  multiple taps on the field coil provide  imprecise  stepped speed control  household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor  causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified ac   universal motors also lend themselves to
and  as such  are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines  the motor can be used to agitate the drum  both forwards and in reverse  by switching the field winding with respect to the armature 
whereas scims cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency  universal motors can run at much higher speeds  this makes them useful for appliances such as blenders  vacuum cleaners  and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable  they are also commonly used in portable power tools  such as drills  sanders  circular and jig saws  where the motor s characteristics work well  many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed 10,000 rpm  while many similar miniature grinders exceed 30,000 rpm 
externally commutated ac machine  
main article 
the design of ac induction and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the ac power grid or for variable-speed application from vfd controllers  an ac motor has two parts  a stationary stator having coils supplied with ac to produce a rotating magnetic field  and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field 
induction motor  
main article 
large 4,500 hp ac induction motor 
cage and wound rotor induction motor  
an induction motor is an asynchronous ac motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction  much like transformer action  an induction motor resembles a rotating transformer  because the stator  stationary part  is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor  rotating part  is the secondary side  polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry 
induction motors may be further divided into squirrel cage induction motors and wound rotor induction motors  scims have a heavy winding made up of solid bars  usually aluminum or copper  joined by rings at the ends of the rotor  when one considers only the bars and rings as a whole  they are much like an animal s rotating exercise cage  hence the name 
currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field  the shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics  at low speeds  the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage  as the motor accelerates  the slip frequency becomes lower  and more current is in the interior of the winding  by shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage  effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit  however  the majority of such motors have uniform bars 
in a wrim  the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to
on the motor shaft  an external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit  resistors allow control of the motor speed  although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance  a converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator 
the wrim is used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range  by correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter  the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed  this type of motor also offers controllable speed 
motor speed can be changed because the torque curve of the motor is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit  increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down  if the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed  the torque will be further reduced 
when used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed  the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque  reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up  and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal  operated in this manner  the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant  the speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor 
torque motor  
main article 
a torque motor is a specialized form of electric motor which can operate indefinitely while stalled  that is  with the rotor blocked from turning  without incurring damage  in this mode of operation  the motor will apply a steady torque to the load  hence the name  
a common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive  in this application  driven from a low voltage  the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads  driven from a higher voltage   and so delivering a higher torque   the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches  in the computer gaming world  torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels 
another common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with an electronic governor  in this usage  the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor  the latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and  depending on the speed  makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor  if the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed  the current will be increased  the motor will develop more torque  pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle  should the engine run too fast  the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor  causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle 
synchronous motor  
main article 
a synchronous electric motor is an ac motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the ac and resulting magnetic field which drives it  another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions  contrast this with an induction motor  which must slip to produce torque  one type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a dc field  slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor  the rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor  another type  for low load torque  has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles  yet another  such as made by hammond for its pre-world war ii clocks  and in the older hammond organs  has no rotor windings and discrete poles  it is not self-starting  the clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back  while the older hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch 
finally  hysteresis synchronous motors typically are  essentially  two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase  they start like induction motors  but when slip rate decreases sufficiently  the rotor  a smooth cylinder  becomes temporarily magnetized  its distributed poles make it act like a pmsm  the rotor material  like that of a common nail  will stay magnetized  but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty  once running  the rotor poles stay in place  they do not drift 
low-power synchronous timing motors  such as those for traditional electric clocks  may have multi-pole pm external cup rotors  and use shading coils to provide starting torque  telechron clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque  and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor

doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets  which contribute active  i e   working  power to the energy conversion process  with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation  two independent multiphase winding sets  i e   dual armature  are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication  doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation  this is twice the constant torque speed range as   which have only one active winding set 
a doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components  difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications 
special magnetic motors  
rotary  
ironless or coreless rotor motor  
a miniature coreless motor
nothing in the principle of any of the motors described above requires that the iron  steel  portions of the rotor actually rotate  if the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder  then  except for the effect of hysteresis  torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets  taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless dc motor  a specialized form of a pm dc motor  optimized for rapid   these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core  the rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder  or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material  the rotor can fit inside the stator magnets  a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux  a second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets  in that design  the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor  and likewise provides a return path for the flux 
because the rotor is much lighter in weight  mass  than a conventional rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations  the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly  often achieving a mechanical
under one ms  this is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper  but because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink  even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air  overheating might be an issue for coreless dc motor designs 
among these types are the disc-rotor types  described in more detail in the next section 
vibrator motors for cellular phones are sometimes tiny cylindrical pm field types  but there are also disc-shaped types which have a thin multipolar disc field magnet  and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils  metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils 
related limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin pms  these are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk   hard disk   drives  although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers  it is still loosely  and incorrectly  referred to as a  voice coil  structure  because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines  and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker 
pancake or axial rotor motor  
a rather unusual motor design  the printed armature or pancake motor has the windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets  the magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor with space in between to form an axial air gap  this design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its extremely flat profile  although the technology has had many brand names since its inception  such as servodisc 
the printed armature  originally formed on a printed circuit board  in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc  the printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in that it does not have a separate ring commutator  the brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact 
an alternative manufacturing method is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator  in a flower and petal shape  the windings are typically stabilized by being impregnated with electrical epoxy potting systems  these are filled epoxies that have moderate mixed viscosity and a long gel time  they are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm  and are typically ul 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180c  class h rating 
the unique advantage of ironless dc motors is that there is no
 torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets   parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless  although iron rotors are laminated  this can greatly improve efficiency  but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate   40khz  or dc because of the decreased  
these motors were originally invented to drive the capstan s  of magnetic tape drives in the burgeoning computer industry  where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical  pancake motors are still widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems  robotic systems  industrial automation and medical devices  due to the variety of constructions now available  the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos 
servo motor  
main article 
a servomotor is a motor  very often sold as a complete module  which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves  such as motor-operated control valves  servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools  pen plotters  and other process systems  motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed  torque  and power  the speed vs  torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor  dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important  these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop  large  powerful  but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional ac or dc motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor  as dynamic response requirements increase  more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used  ac motors  superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of dc motors tends to favor pm synchronous  bldc  induction  and srm drive applications 
a servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running  a stepper system relies on the motor not to  miss steps  for short term accuracy  although a stepper system may include a  home  switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control  for instance  when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up  its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit  where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping  as long as power is on  a bidirectional counter in the printer s microprocessor keeps track of print-head position 
stepper motor  
main article 
a stepper motor with a soft iron rotor  with active windings shown  in  a  the active windings tend to hold the rotor in position  in  b  a different set of windings are carrying a current  which generates torque and rotation 
stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required  in a stepper motor an internal rotor containing pms or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically  a stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a dc electric motor and a rotary solenoid  as each coil is energized in turn  the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding  unlike a synchronous motor  in its application  the stepper motor may not rotate continuously  instead  it  steps starts and then quickly stops againfrom one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence  depending on the sequence  the rotor may turn forwards or backwards  and it may change direction  stop  speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time 
simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings  leading the rotor to  cog  to a limited number of positions  more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings  allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly  this mode of operation is often called   computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems  particularly when part of a digital
system 
stepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease  and hence stepper motors are used for read write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives  they were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives  where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read write head of a hard disk drive  as drive density increased  the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drivesthe precision limitation made them unusable  and the speed limitation made them uncompetitivethus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems   the term  voice coil  in this connection is historic  it refers to the structure in a typical  cone type  loudspeaker  this structure was used for a while to position the heads  modern drives have a pivoted coil mount  the coil swings back and forth  something like a blade of a rotating fan  nevertheless  like a voice coil  modern actuator coil conductors  the magnet wire  move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force  
stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers  optical scanners  and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element  the print head carriage  of dot matrix and inkjet printers   and the platen or feed rollers  likewise  many computer plotters  which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers  used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement  the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems 
so-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors  they have one coil  draw very little power  and have a pm rotor  the same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks  some of these watches  such as chronographs  contain more than one stepping motor 
closely related in design to three-phase ac synchronous motors  stepper motors and srms are classified as variable reluctance motor type  stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers  optical scanners  and
machines such as routers  plasma cutters and cnc lathes 
linear motor  
main article 
a linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been  unrolled  so that  instead of producing a
 rotation   it produces a straight-line force along its length 
linear motors are most commonly
or stepper motors  linear motors are commonly found in many roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail  they are also used in   where the train  flies  over the ground  on a smaller scale  the 1978 era hp 7225a pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the x and y axes

back emf  
main article 
since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field  they have a voltage induced in them  this voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called     the voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor  the back emf of the motor  plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes  must equal the voltage at the brushes  this provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a dc motor  if the mechanical load increases  the motor slows down  a lower back emf results  and more current is drawn from the supply  this increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load 
in ac machines  it is sometimes useful to consider a back emf source within the machine  this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on vfds  for example 
losses

in windings  core losses and mechanical losses in bearings  and aerodynamic losses  particularly where cooling fans are present  also occur

performance parameters  
torque capability of motor types  
this section only describes one highly specialized aspect of its associated subject  please help
by adding more general information  the
may contain suggestions   march 2012 
all the electromagnetic motors  and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields  for calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap   once these have been established by mathematical analysis using fea or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector  the current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current  this makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed 
once this is done a figure relating the current to the torque can be used as a useful parameter for motor selection  the maximum torque for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be  only usable until thermal considerations take precedence 
when optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current  i e   torque current   voltage  pole-pair number  excitation frequency  i e   synchronous speed   and air-gap flux density  all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque  i e   operating torque  within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth  which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core  some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque  such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill  always limited by
or safe
rise and voltage  the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators 
capacity for bursts of torque should not be confused with field weakening capability  field weakening allows an electric machine to operate beyond the designed frequency of excitation  field weakening is done when the maximum speed cannot be reached by increasing the applied voltage  this applies to only motors with current controlled fields and therefore cannot be achieved with pm motors 
electric machines without a transformer circuit topology  such as that of wrsms or pmsms  cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless  furthermore  the pm assembly of pmsms can be irreparably damaged  if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted 
electric machines with a transformer circuit topology  such as induction machines  induction doubly-fed electric machines  and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed  wrdf  machines  exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density  which would otherwise lead to core saturation 
electric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result  the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases  which limits the magnitude of active  i e   real  current  still  bursts of torque that are two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable 
the brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed  bwrsdf  machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology  i e   both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port   the dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set  if a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set  the active current of the bwrsdf machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable  torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated 
continuous torque density  
the continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth  which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set  the speed of the machine  and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation  despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt pms  continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets  continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or pm damage 
continuous power density  
the continuous power density is determined by the product of the continuous torque density and the constant torque speed range of the electric machine

an electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge  usually  electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors  they typically require a high-voltage power supply  although very small motors employ lower voltages  conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion  and require high current at low voltages  in the 1750s  the first electrostatic motors were developed by benjamin franklin and andrew gordon  today the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems    where their drive voltages are below 100 volts  and where moving  charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores  also  the molecular machinery which runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors   
a piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a
when an
is applied  piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or
vibrations in order to produce a linear or rotary motion  in one mechanism  the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds  similar to the way a caterpillar moves   
an electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electric motor technology to propel spacecraft in outer space  most systems being based on electrically powering propellant to high speed  with some systems being based on
principles of propulsion to the magnetosphere

current-regulated sinusoidal waveform involving interior pm motor construction
