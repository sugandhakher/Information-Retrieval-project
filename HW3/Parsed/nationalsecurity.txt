definitions  
there is no single universally accepted definition of national security  the variety of definitions provide an overview of the many usages of this concept  the concept still remains ambiguous  having originated from simpler definitions which initially emphasised the freedom from military threat and political coercion to later increase in sophistication and include other forms of non-military security as suited the circumstances of the time  16 5254
a typical dictionary definition  in this case from the macmillan dictionary  online version   defines the term as  the protection or the safety of a countrys secrets and its citizens  emphasising the overall security of a nation and a     in 1943  defined it in terms of war saying that  a nation has security when it does not have to sacrifice its legitimate nterests to avoid war  and is able  if challenged  to maintain them by war   5 a later definition by   a political scientist  in 1950  looks at national security from almost the same aspect  that of external    the distinctive meaning of national security means freedom from foreign dictation   79
arnold wolfers  1960   while recognising the need to segregate the subjectivity of the conceptual idea from the objectivity  talks of threats to  acquired values    an ambiguous symbol meaning different things to different people  national security objectively means the absence of threats to acquired values and subjectively  the absence of fear that such values will be attacked   the 1996 definition propagated by the
accretes the    national security is an appropriate and aggressive blend of political resilience and maturity  human resources  economic structure and capacity  technological competence  industrial base and availability of natural resources and finally the military might  
 
from 1977 to 1981 in the   enlarged the definition of national security by including elements such as economic and environmental security 
national security then is the ability to preserve the nation s physical integrity and territory  to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms  to preserve its nature  institution  and governance from disruption from outside  and to control its borders 
in 1990 
history professor
defined national security through the lens of national power   national security    is best described as a capacity to control those domestic and foreign conditions that the public opinion of a given community believes necessary to enjoy its own self-determination or autonomy  prosperity and wellbeing   according to   author of national security  imperatives and challenges  national security may be defined as 
the measurable state of the capability of a nation to overcome the multi-dimensional threats to the apparent well-being of its people and its survival as a nation-state at any given time  by balancing all instruments of state policy through governance  that can be indexed by computation  empirically or otherwise  and is extendable to global security by variables external to it  5254
a concise working definition by premaratne that paraphrases the aspects of the definitions of brown  romm and paleri 5254 defines national security as
safeguarding the sovereignty  territorial integrity  citizenry and socioeconomic functionality of a nation from an aggressor intent on undermining a particular valued aspect of a nation through violent or unjust means
origin  
the origin of the modern concept of  national security  as a philosophy of maintaining a stable nation state can be traced to the   wherein the concept of a   ruled by a   became the basis of a new international order of nation states  19 it was
in his 1651 work
who stated that citizens yield to a powerful sovereign who in turn promises an end to civil and religious war  and to bring forth a lasting peace  and give him the right to conduct policy  including wage war or negotiate for peace for the good of the  commonwealth   i e   a mandate for national security  the clausewitzian view of diplomacy and war being the instruments of furthering national cause  added to the view of national security being sought by nations by exercising self-interest at all times  this view came to be known as    in international relations 
  in his 1795 essay  perpetual peace  a philosophical sketch      proposed a system where nation-states and dominating national interests were replaced by an enlightened world order  a community of mankind where nation-states subsumed the national interests under the rule of the international law because of rational insight  common good and moral commitment  national security was achieved by this voluntary accession by the leadership to a higher order than the nation-state  viz      thus was born the    school of international relations 
as an academic concept  national security can be seen as a recent phenomenon which was first introduced in the
after   24 and has to some degree replaced other concepts that describe the struggle of states to overcome various external and internal threats  the term was used during discourse on war  for example 
in 1943 criticized an unwillingness of political pundits to discuss  the foundations of national security  in a time of peace  49 however  the earliest mention of the term national security  can be traced to 1790 in
in reference to its relation with domestic industries  52
elements of national security  
main article 
as in the case of   the
of security is an important  but not the sole  component of national security  to be truly secure  a nation needs other forms of security  authorities differ in their choice of nation security elements  besides the military aspect of security  the aspects of diplomacy or politics  society  environment  energy and natural resources  and economics are commonly listed  the elements of national security correlate closely to the concept of the   romm  1993  lists security from narcotic cartels  economic security  environmental security and energy security as the non-military elements of national security  v  18
military security  
main article 
military security is traditionally the earliest recognised form of national security  67 military security implies the capability of a nation to defend itself  and or deter military aggression  alternatively  military security implies the capability of a nation to enforce its policy choices by use of military force  the term  military security  is considered synonymous with    in much of its usage  one of the definitions of security given in the dictionary of military and associated terms  may be considered a definition of military security   a condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that ensure a state of inviolability from hostile acts or influences  
political security  
the political aspect of security has been offered by barry buzan  ole wver  jaap de wilde as an important component of national security  political security is about the stability of the social order  closely allied to military security and societal security  other components proposed in a framework for national security in their book  security  a new framework for analysis   it specifically addresses threats to sovereignty  system referent objects are defined  such as   nations  transnational groups of political importance including tribes  minorities  some religious organisations  systems of states such as the
and the   besides others  diplomacy  negotiation and other interactions form the means of interaction between the objects 
economic security  
main article 
historically  conquest of nations has made conquerors rich through plunder  access to new resources and enlarged trade by controlling a conquered nations  economy  in today s complex system of international trade  characterised by multi-national agreements  mutual inter-dependence and availability of natural resources etc   the freedom to exercise choice of policies to develop a nation s economy in the manner desired  invites economic security  economic security today forms  arguably  as important a part of national security as military security  the creation and protection of jobs that supply defense and non-defense needs are vital to national security  third world countries are less secure due to lack of employment for their citizens 
environmental security  
main article

environmental security deals with environmental issues which threaten the national security of a nation in any manner  the scope and nature of environmental threats to national security and strategies to engage them are a subject of debate  2933 while all environmental events are not considered significant of being categorised as threats  many transnational issues  both global and regional would affect national security  romm  1993  classifies these as  15
transnational environmental problems that threaten a nation s security  in its broad defined sense  these include global environmental problems such as
due to   deforestation and loss of biodiversity  etc  15
environmental or resource problems that threaten a nation s security  traditionally defined  these would be problems whose outcomes would result in conventional threats to national security as first or higher order outcomes  such disputes could range from heightened tension or outright conflict due to disputes over water scarcity in the   to illegal immigration into the united states caused by the failure of agriculture in   15 the genocide in   indirectly or partly caused by rise in population and dwindling availability of farmland  is an example of the extremity of outcome arising from problems of environmental security

the interrelation between security  energy  natural resources  and their sustainability is increasingly acknowledged by the international community  as proven by the fact that energy is now one of the issues amidst the un sustainable development goals  as well as a cardinal issues for investment promotion policies at national level 
cyber-security  
main article 
recently  cybersecurity began to be viewed as a pressing national security issue  electronic information systems are vital for maintaining a national security of any state  possible unauthorized access to the critical governmental infrastructures by state and non-state entities can create a serious threat and have a negative impact on political  economic and military security of a given nation 
in the united states  the bush administration in january 2008  initiated the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative  cnci   it introduced a differentiated approach  such as  identifying existing and emerging cybersecurity threats  finding and plugging existing cyber vulnerabilities  and apprehending actors that trying to gain access to secure federal information systems  president obama issued a declaration that the  cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation  and that  america s economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity  
empowerment of women  
main article 
u s  secretary of state
has said that  the countries that threaten regional and global peace are the very places where women and girls are deprived of dignity and opportunity   she has noted that countries where women are oppressed are places where the  rule of law and democracy are struggling to take root   and that  when women s rights as equals in society are upheld  the society as a whole changes and improves  which in turn enhances stability in that society  which in turn contributes to global society

and the  
notably  the act did not define national security  which was conceivably advantageous  as its ambiguity made it a powerful phrase to invoke whenever issues threatened by other interests of the state  such as domestic concerns  came up for discussion and decision  35
the notion that national security encompasses more than just military security was present  though understated  from the beginning  the act established the national security council so as to  advise the president on the integration of domestic  military and foreign policies relating to national security   52
while not defining the  interests  of national security  the act does establish  within the national security council  the  committee on foreign intelligence   whose duty is to conduct an annual review  identifying the intelligence required to address the national security interests of the united states as specified by the president   emphasis added

the national valuables in this broad sense include current assets and national interests  as well as the sources of strength upon which our future as a nation depends  some valuables are tangible and earthy  others are spiritual or intellectual  they range widely from political assets such as the bill of rights  our political institutions and international friendships  to many economic assets which radiate worldwide from a highly productive domestic economy supported by rich natural resources  it is the urgent need to protect valuables such as these which legitimizes and makes essential the role of national security

a collective term encompassing both national defense and foreign relations of the united states  specifically  the condition provided by  a  a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations  b  a favorable foreign relations position  or c  a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile or destructive action from within or without  overt or covert

prosperity  a strong  innovative  and growing u s  economy in an open international economic system that promotes opportunity and prosperity 
values  respect for universal values at home and around the world 
international order  an international order advanced by u s  leadership that promotes peace  security  and opportunity through stronger cooperation to meet global challenges

africa  
conceptualising and understanding the national security choices and challenges of african states is a difficult task  this is due to the fact that it is often not rooted in the understanding of their  mostly disrupted  state formation and their often imported process of state building 
although post-cold war conceptualizations of security have broadened  the policies and practices of many african states still privilege national security as being synonymous with state security and even more narrowly- regime security 
the problem with the above is that a number of african states have been unable to govern their security in meaningful ways  often failing to be able to claim the monopoly of force in their territories  a hybridity of security governance or providers thus exists  states that have not been able to capture this reality in official national security strategies and policies often find their claim over having the monopoly of force and thus being the sovereign challenged  this often leads to the weakening of the state  examples of such states are

to reflect on institutionalization of new bureaucratic infrastructures and governmental practices in the post- period in the u s   when a culture of semi-permanent military mobilization brought around the national security council  the cia  the department of defense  and the joint chiefs of staff  national-security researchers apply a notion of a national security state 
during and after worldwar ii  us leaders expanded the concept of national security and used its terminology for the first time to explain americas relationship to the world  for most of us history  the physical security of the continental united states had not been in jeopardy  but by 1945  this invulnerability was rapidly diminishing with the advent of long-range bombers  atom bombs  and ballistic missiles  a general perception grew that the future would not allow time to mobilize  that preparation would have to become constant  for the first time  american leaders would have to deal with the essential paradox of national security faced by the roman empire and subsequent great powers  si vis pacem  para bellum  if you want peace  prepare for war

although national security measures are imposed to protect society as a whole  many such measures may restrict the rights and freedoms of individuals in society  where the exercise of national security laws and powers is not subject to   the   and strict   there is a risk that national security may simply serve as a pretext for suppressing   measures which may ostensibly serve a national security purpose  such as   and

functional aspects  
because of the highly competitive nature of nation states and the fluid state of world order  national security preparedness depends as much on routine technical measures and operational procedures as on central decision making  this ranges from information protection to state secrets to weaponry to international negotiation strategies  any given national security apparatus runs on combination of management practices and technical capabilities  emerging issues such as proliferation  failing states  climate change and global
increasingly dominate the reality of competition between nation states  all of these lead to the need to have a clear understanding of the technical issues underlying national security in order to create and sustain the national security institutions that may ultimately affect the future of a nation state
