new urbanism is an
movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating
neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types  it arose in the united states in the early 1980s  and has gradually influenced many aspects of     and municipal
strategies 
new urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to   it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design  tnd  and
 tod   these ideas can all be circled back to two concepts  building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices

the organizing body for new urbanism is the congress for the new urbanism  founded in 1993  its foundational text is the charter of the new urbanism  which begins 
we advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles  neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population  communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car  cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions  urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history  climate    and building practice

background  
new broad street 
until the mid 20th century  cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods  for most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable  although with the development of
the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines  allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as   but with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies  attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car  specifically  after world war ii
largely centered around the use of municipal
ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development  and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class  the physical separation of where people live from where they work  shop and frequently spend their recreational time  together with low housing density  which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms  made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of  
beach drive 
this new system of development  with its rigorous separation of uses  arose after
and became known as  conventional suburban development  or pejoratively as   the majority of u s  citizens now live in
communities built in the last fifty years  and automobile use per capita has soared 
post office  designed by architect
although new urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later  a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the
planning techniques being put into practice  social philosopher and historian
criticized the  anti-urban  development of post-war america    written by
in the early 1960s  called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects  large car-dependent thoroughfares  and segregated commercial centers that had become the  norm   the french architect
has developed in the 60  the concept of  soft architecture  that he applied to   a new marina in south of france  the success of this project will have a considerable influence and will lead to many new projects of soft architecture like
in
or
in france 
rooted in these early dissenters  the ideas behind new urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the  european  city proposed by architect   and the
theories of   the term  new urbanism  itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s  but it wasn t until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized 
in 1991  the   a private nonprofit group in   invited architects   michael corbett          and
to develop a set of community principles for land use planning  named the ahwahnee principles  after  s    the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991  at its first yosemite conference for local elected officials 
calthorpe  duany  moule  plater-zyberk  polyzoides  and solomon founded the chicago-based congress for the new urbanism in 1993  the cnu has grown to more than three thousand members  and is the leading international organization promoting new urbanist design principles  it holds annual congresses in various u s  cities 
in 2009  co-founders elizabeth moule  hank dittmar  and stefanos polyzoides authored the canons of sustainable architecture and urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between new urbanism and sustainability  the canons are  a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building  the making of community  and the conservation of our natural world   they promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions  the use of locally obtained materials  and in general  a  culture of permanence  
new urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales  and while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant  new urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning  architecture  and public policy 
defining elements  
in   showing a mix of aggregate housing and traditional
and   two of the founders of the congress for the new urbanism  observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops  front porches  and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the
neighborhoods of   they and their colleagues observed patterns including the following 
a park in
the neighborhood has a discernible center  this is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner  a transit stop would be located at this center 
most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center  an average of roughly 0.25 miles  0.40km  
there are a variety of dwelling types  usually houses    and
 so that younger and older people 
and families  the poor and the wealthy may find places to live 
at the edge of the neighborhood  there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household 
a small ancillary building or
is permitted within the backyard of each house  it may be used as a rental unit or place to work  for example  an office or craft workshop  
an elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home 
there are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling  not more than a tenth of a mile away 
streets within the neighborhood form a connected network  which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination 
the streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees  this slows traffic  creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles 
buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street  creating a well-defined outdoor room 
parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street  parking is relegated to the rear of buildings  usually accessed by alleys 
certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings  these provide sites for community meetings  education  and religious or cultural activities 
terminology  
a
house in
several terms are viewed either as synonymous  included in  or overlapping with the new urbanism  the terms neotraditional development or traditional neighborhood development are often associated with the new urbanism  these terms generally refer to complete new towns or new neighborhoods  often built in traditional architectural styles  as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects  the term traditional urbanism has also been used to describe the new urbanism by those who object to the  new  moniker  the term  walkable urbanism  was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor christopher leinberger  many debate whether
and the new urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two  overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements  placemaking is another term that is often used to signify new urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups  the term transit-oriented development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent new urbanist
and is heavily promoted by new urbanists  the term
is sometimes associated with the new urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of new urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s  however  this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the
and
to include
issues  e g     that exceed the scope of
intended to be addressed by the new urbanism or   the term livability or livable communities has also become popular under u s  president  s administration though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the  
a
style house in
planning magazine discussed the proliferation of  urbanisms  in an article in 2011 titled  a short guide to 60 of the newest urbanisms  
several new urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the new urbanism including
and tactical urbanism  of which guerrilla urbanism can be viewed as a subset   the term tactical urbanism was coined by frenchman michel de certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by new urbanist mike lydon and the co-authors of the tactical urbanism guide  in 2011
authored a book that used the term agrarian urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of new urbanist town design  in 2013 a group of new urbanists led by cnu co-founder
began a research project under the banner of lean urbanism which purported to provide a bridge between tactical urbanism and the new urbanism 
other terms have surfaced in reaction to the new urbanism intended to provide a contrast  alternative to  or a refinement of the new urbanism  some of these terms include everyday urbanism by harvard professor margaret crawford  john chase  and john kaliski    and true urbanism by architect bernard zyscovich 
was popularized by charles waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the new urbanism in his lectures at harvard university  a book called landscape urbanism and its discontents  edited by andres duany and emily talen  specifically addressed the tension between these two views of  
promotes what he describes as a variant of the new urbanism called the   which is intended to be a more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929

criticism  
the examples and perspective in this article may not represent a
of the subject  you may   discuss the issue on the   or   as appropriate   february 2010    
new urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the   it has been criticized both for being a
scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers 
in an interview in   a
magazine  professor peter gordon  a professor of urban planning from   spoke in favor of suburbanization  stating that the new urbanism ignores consumer preference the free market and that cities have moved towards car-oriented development because that is what people want 
on the other hand  journalist
has decried new urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a faade of nostalgic imagery and empty  aspirational slogans  in a 1996 article in   marshall denounced new urbanism as  a grand fraud   the attack continued in numerous articles  including an opinion column in the washington post in september of the same year  and in marshall s first book 
critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the new urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence  independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments  but the argument that new urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in canada 
some parties have criticized the new urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking  cycling  and public transport  the charter of the new urbanism states that  communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car   some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of   michael e arth proposes
as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths  steve melia proposes the idea of  filtered permeability   see   which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limited the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime 
in response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the new urbanism s claimed environmental benefits  a rating system for neighborhood environmental design    was developed by the     and the   to quantify the sustainability of new urbanist neighborhood design  new urbanist and board member of cnu 
has taken a step further and coined   which combines new urbanism and leed-nd to create walkable  transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure 
new urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned  large-scale development   instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves   it has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions

new urbanism is closely related to the
movement in europe  they both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning  in europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than modernist models  one well-publicized example is
in england  a suburban extension to the town of dorchester  which was built on land owned by the
under the overview of   the original masterplan was designed by   a report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents  although the aspirations to reduce
