ammonia or azane is a
of
and
with the
nh3  the simplest   ammonia is a colourless
with a characteristic pungent smell  it contributes significantly to the
needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to
and   ammonia  either directly or indirectly  is also a building block for the synthesis of many
and is used in many commercial cleaning products 
although common in nature and in wide use  ammonia is both
and
in its concentrated form  it is classified as an
in the united states as defined in section 302 of the u s 
 42 u s c  11002   and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce  store  or use it in significant quantities 
the global industrial production of ammonia in 2014 was 176million tonnes  173,000,000 long tons  194,000,000 short tons   a 16  increase over the 2006 global industrial production of 152million tonnes  150,000,000 long tons  168,000,000 short tons  
nh3 boils at 33.34c  28.012f  at a pressure of one   so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature  household ammonia or
is a solution of nh3 in water  the concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the

contents
natural occurrence  
ammonia is found in trace quantities in nature  being produced from the nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter  ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater  whereas
    and
are found in volcanic districts  crystals of
have been found in
  the
secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid  ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater 
ammonia is also found throughout the
on           and   among other places  on smaller  icy worlds like pluto  ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze  as a mixture of water and ammonia can potentially have a melting point of as low as 173 kelvins if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such worlds to retain internal oceans and active geology far longer than would be possible with water alone  substances containing ammonia  or those that are similar to it  are called ammoniacal 
properties  
ammonia is a colourless
with a characteristic pungent smell  it is   its density being 0.589 times that of   it is easily liquefied due to the strong
between molecules  the
boils at 33.3c  27.94f   and freezes at 77.7c  107.86f  to white crystals 
ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or   both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt

 23.35 mol  cf 
40.65kj mol  methane 8.19kj mol 
14.6kj mol  and can therefore be used in laboratories in uninsulated vessels without additional refrigeration  see  
solvent properties
ammonia is
with water  in an aqueous solution  it can be expelled by boiling  the
solution of ammonia is   the maximum concentration of ammonia in water  a
solution  has a
of 0.880 g cm3 and is often known as   880 ammonia   ammonia does not burn readily or sustain   except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 1525  air 
combustion
when mixed with   it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame  at high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst  ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements  ignition occurs when
is passed into ammonia  forming nitrogen and   if chlorine is present in excess  then the highly explosive
 ncl3  is also formed 
structure  
the ammonia molecule has a
shape as predicted by the
 vsepr theory  with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7  the central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom  this gives a total of eight electrons  or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally  three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs  which leaves one lone pair of electrons  the lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs  therefore the bond angle is not 109.5  as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement  but 106.7  the nitrogen atom in the molecule has a   which makes ammonia a   a proton acceptor  this shape gives the molecule a
moment and makes it   the molecule s polarity and  especially  its ability to form   makes ammonia highly miscible with   ammonia is moderately basic  a 1.0 m aqueous solution has a ph of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral  ph   7   99.4  of the ammonia molecules are   temperature and
also affect the proportion of nh4   the latter has the shape of a regular
and is
with  
the ammonia molecule readily undergoes
at room temperature  a useful analogy is an
turning itself inside out in a strong wind  the energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kj mol  and the
is 23.79   corresponding to
radiation of a
of 1.260cm  the absorption at this frequency was the first
to be observed 
amphotericity  
one of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its   ammonia is considered to be a weak base  it combines with
to form   thus with
it forms
 sal ammoniac   with     etc  perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry   moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction  as a demonstration experiment  opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride  which seem to appear  out of nothing  as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet  somewhere between the two bottles 
nh3   hcl  nh4cl
the salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the
and all contain the
 nh4   
although ammonia is well known as a weak base  it can also act as an extremely weak acid  it is a protic substance and is capable of formation of
 which contain the nh2 ion   for example

the combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst  such as
gauze or warm    because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammoniaair mixture  the flammable range of ammonia in air is 1625  
formation of other compounds

would be named  chloroazane  in substitutive nomenclature  not  chloroammonia  
pentavalent ammonia is known as 5-amine  or more commonly  ammonium hydride  this crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure  and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions  this substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966

detection and determination  
this section is about detection in the laboratory  for detection in astronomy  see chapter  
ammonia in solution  
ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected  in very minute traces  by the addition of   which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the least trace of ammonia or ammonium salts  the amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with
or   the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard

ammoniacal nitrogen  nh3-n   
 nh3-n  is a measure commonly used for testing the quantity of
ions  derived naturally from ammonia  and returned to ammonia via organic processes  in water or waste liquids  it is a measure used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems  as well as a measure of the health of natural and man made water reserves  it is measured in units of mg l   per

the romans gave the name sal ammoniacus  salt of amun  to the ammonium chloride deposits that they collected near the temple of
   ammon  in   salts of ammonia have been known from very early times  thus the term hammoniacus sal appears in the writings of   although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern sal ammoniac  ammonium chloride  
in the form of sal ammoniac    nushadir  ammonia was important to the

cleaner  
household ammonia is a solution of nh3 in water  i e     used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces  because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine  one of its most common uses is to clean glass  porcelain and stainless steel  it is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime  household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5 to 10  ammonia 
fermentation  
solutions of ammonia ranging from 16  to 25  are used in the
industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust ph during fermentation

of liquid ammonia is 11.5 mj l  which is about a third that of   although it can be used as a fuel  for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread 
ammonia engines or ammonia motors  using ammonia as a   have been proposed and occasionally used  the principle is similar to that used in a   but with ammonia as the working fluid  instead of steam or compressed air  ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by
in the uk and the
line in new orleans in the 1870s and 1880s  and during
ammonia was used to power buses in belgium 
ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to
for   its high octane rating of 120 and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high nox production  since ammonia contains no carbon  its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide  hydrocarbons or soot 
however ammonia cannot be easily used in existing
engines because of its very narrow
and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage  in terms of raw ammonia supplies  plants would have to be built to increase production levels  requiring significant capital and energy sources  although it is the second most produced chemical  the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage  it could be manufactured from renewable energy sources  as well as coal or nuclear power  the 60 mw
in   norway produced ammonia via electrolysis of water for many years from 1913 producing fertilizer for much of europe 
despite this  several tests have been done  in 1981  a canadian company converted a 1981 chevrolet impala to operate using ammonia as fuel  in 2007  a university of michigan pickup powered by ammonia drove from detroit to san francisco as part of a demonstration  requiring only one fill-up in wyoming 
compared to   ammonia is much more energy efficient  and it would be a much lower cost to produce  store  and deliver hydrogen as ammonia than as compressed and or cryogenic hydrogen  the conversion of ammonia to hydrogen via the sodium-amide process  either as a catalyst for combustion or as fuel for a   is another possibility  conversion to hydrogen would allow the storage of hydrogen at nearly 18 wt  compared to  5  for gaseous hydrogen under pressure 
rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia  the
rocket engine that powered the
hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia  although not as powerful as other fuels  it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer  liquid oxygen  which simplified the aircraft s design

toxicity  
the toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals  as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream  ammonia is converted to
by the enzyme   and then enters the
to be either incorporated into
or excreted in the urine   
and
lack this mechanism  as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion  ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals  and for this reason it is
as dangerous for the environment 
coking wastewater  
ammonia is present in coking wastewater streams  as a liquid by-product of the production of
from   in some cases  the ammonia is discharged to the
where it acts as a pollutant  the
in
is one example of a coke-producing facility which discharges ammonia into marine waters 
aquaculture  
ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries  excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body ph of the exposed organism  tolerance varies among fish species  at lower concentrations  around 0.05mg l  un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates  reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases  exposed to excess ammonia  fish may suffer loss of equilibrium  hyper-excitability  increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate  at concentrations exceeding 2.0mg l  ammonia causes gill and tissue damage  extreme lethargy  convulsions  coma  and death  experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0mg l 
during winter  when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock  ammonia levels can be higher  lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present  within an aquaculture environment  especially at large scale  there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels  prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems  the surrounding environment 
storage information  
similar to

household use  
solutions of ammonia  510  by weight  are used as household cleaners  particularly for glass  these solutions are irritating to the eyes and
 respiratory and digestive tracts   and to a lesser extent the skin  caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach  as a poisonous gas may result  mixing with -containing products or strong oxidants  such as household   can lead to hazardous compounds such as  
laboratory use of ammonia solutions

the ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract  and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood  saturated   0.880   solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather  and the bottle should be opened with care  this is not usually a problem for 25    0.900   solutions 
ammonia solutions should not be mixed with   as toxic and or explosive products are formed  prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with  
or
salts can also lead to explosive products  such mixtures are often formed in   and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated   6  w v  before disposal once the test is completed 
laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia  gas or liquid   
anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic  t  and dangerous for the environment  n   the gas is flammable    651c  and can form explosive mixtures with air  1625    the
 pel  in the united states is 50  35mg m3   while the
concentration is estimated at 300ppm  repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas  normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50ppm  but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100ppm  anhydrous ammonia corrodes - and -containing   and so

production trend of ammonia between 1947 and 2007
because of its many uses  ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals  dozens of
worldwide produce ammonia  consuming more than 1  of all man-made power 
is a significant component of the world energy budget  the usgs reports global ammonia production in 2014 was 176 million tonnes  china accounted for 32.6  of that  increasingly from coal as part of
synthesis   followed by russia at 8.1   india at 7.6   and the united states at 6.4   about 88  of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops 
before the start of   most ammonia was obtained by the
of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products  including
  where it was
by the reduction of
and
with hydrogen  in addition  it was produced by the distillation of   and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by
hydroxides such as   the salt most generally used being the chloride    thus

hydrogen for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically by using the
reaction followed by the
reaction  produced by passing steam through red-hot   to give a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases  followed by removal of the carbon dioxide  washing  the gas mixture with water under pressure  25
 2,500    or by using other sources like coal or coke gasification 
modern ammonia-producing plants depend on industrial
to react with atmospheric nitrogen using a
or over a promoted fe catalyst under high pressure  100 standard atmospheres  10,000kpa   and temperature  450c  to form anhydrous liquid ammonia  this step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop  also referred to as the   
3 h2   n2  2 nh3
hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification or less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen   hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale  at one time  most of europe s ammonia was produced from the hydro plant at   via the electrolysis route  various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable 
as a sustainable alternative to the relatively inefficient   hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes  such as biomass or food-industry waste   using   this releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only 1020  of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost  allowing for the tipping fees and efficient catalytic reforming  such as cold-plasma   catalytic  thermal  reforming is possible in small  distributed  even mobile  plants  to take advantage of low-value  stranded biomass biowaste or natural gas deposits  conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage  as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on-demand  without the need for high-pressure or cryogenic storage 
it is also easier to store ammonia on board vehicles than to store hydrogen  as ammonia is less flammable than petrol or lpg 
for small scale laboratory synthesis  one can heat urea and ca oh 2

liquid ammonia as a solvent

liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent  its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured  electrically conductive solutions containing   apart from these remarkable solutions  much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions  comparison of the physical properties of nh3 with those of water shows nh3 has the lower melting point  boiling point  density   
and   this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in nh3 and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks  since each nh3 molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each h2o molecule  the ionic self- of liquid nh3 at 50c is about 1033 mol2l2

the range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow  as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen 
 n2   6nh4    6e  8nh3   is only  0.04v  in practice  both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow  this is particularly true of reducing solutions  the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days  slowly decomposing to the
and dihydrogen  most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions  although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow  there is still a risk of explosion  particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts 
ammonia s role in biological systems and human disease  
main symptoms of hyperammonemia  ammonia reaching toxic concentrations  
ammonia is both a
and a metabolic input throughout the   it is an important source of nitrogen for living systems  although atmospheric nitrogen abounds  more than 75    few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form  n2 gas  therefore 
is required for the synthesis of amino acids  which are the building blocks of   some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter  others  such as nitrogen-fixing   benefit from
relationships with
that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen 
biosynthesis  
in certain organisms  ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by
called   the overall process is called   although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods that are competitive with the
will be developed    intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation  the scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme  which consists of an fe7mos9 ensemble 
ammonia is also a metabolic product of
catalyzed by enzymes such as   ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals  in humans  it is quickly converted to   which is much less toxic  particularly less   this urea is a major component of the dry weight of   most reptiles  birds  insects  and snails excrete

in physiology  
ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal   it is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations  the
converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the   liver dysfunction  such as that seen in   may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood     likewise  defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle  such as   lead to hyperammonemia  hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and
of   as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and  
ammonia is important for normal animal acid base balance  after formation of ammonium from

in astronomy  
ammonia occurs in the
of the outer gas planets such as
 0.026  ammonia  and
 0.012  ammonia  
ammonia has been detected in the atmospheres of the
planets  including   along with other gases like methane  hydrogen  and   the interior of saturn may include frozen crystals of ammonia  it is naturally found on

 the two  
interstellar space  
ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968  based on
emissions from the direction of the   this was the first
molecule to be so detected  the sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of   the relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium 
the following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected 
nh3  15nh3  nh2  nhd2  and nd3
the detection of triply
ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce  it is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate 
since its interstellar discovery  nh3 has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium  with a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions  nh3 has been widely astronomically detected  its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles  listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia 
the study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades  some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer 
interstellar formation mechanisms  
ball-and-stick model of the diamminesilver i  cation   ag nh3 2  
the interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments  the  nh3   h2  ratio has been estimated to range from 107 in small dark clouds up to 105 in the dense core of the   although a total of 18 total production routes have been proposed  the principal formation mechanism for interstellar nh3 is the reaction 
nh4    e  nh3   h
the rate constant  k  of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment  with a value of 5.2106 at 10 k  the rate constant was calculated from the formula k   a t 300 b  for the primary formation reaction  a 1.05106 and b 0.47  assuming an nh4  abundance of 3107 and an electron abundance of 107 typical of molecular clouds  the formation will proceed at a rate of 1.6109 cm3s1 in a molecular cloud of total density 105 cm3 
all other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller  making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant  as an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play  the reaction 
h2   nh2  nh3   h
has a rate constant of 2.21015  assuming h2 densities of 105 and nh2 h2 ratio of 107  this reaction proceeds at a rate of 2.21012  more than 3 orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above 
some of the other possible formation reactions are 
h   nh4   nh3   h2
pnh3    e  p   nh3
interstellar destruction mechanisms  
there are 113 total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of nh3  of these  39 were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among c  n  and o compounds  a review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms 
 1  nh3   h3   nh4    h2
 2  nh3   hco   nh4    co
with rate constants of 4.39109 and 2.2109  respectively  the above equations  1,2  run at a rate of 8.8109 and 4.41013  respectively  these calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of  nh3   h2    105   h3    h2    2105   hco    h2    2109  and total densities of n   105  typical of cold  dense  molecular clouds  clearly  between these two primary reactions  equation  1  is the dominant destruction reaction  with a rate  10,000 times faster than equation  2   this is due to the relatively high abundance of h3  
single antenna detections  
radio observations of nh3 from the
reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components  a background ridge and an unresolved core  the background corresponds well with the locations previously detected co  the 25 m chilbolton telescope in england detected radio signatures of ammonia in   hnh2o   h-h objects  and other objects associated with star formation  a comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds 
microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including w3 oh     w43  w51  and five sources in the galactic centre  the high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high-density regions are common in the galaxy 
interferometric studies  
observations of nh3 in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 0.1
in l1551  s140  and   three individual condensations were detected in cepheus a  one of them with a highly elongated shape  they may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region 
extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the vla in   the hot gas has temperatures above 70 k  which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in co  nh3 was also monitored by vla toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact hii regions  g9.62 0.19  g10.47 0.03  g29.96-0.02  and g31.41 0.31  based upon temperature and density diagnostics  it is concluded that in general such clumps are likely to be the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact hii region 
infrared detections  
absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the
and probably in ngc 2264-ir as well  this detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines 
a spectrum of the disk of jupiter was obtained from the   covering the 100 to 300cm1 spectral range  analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze 
a total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of  dense cores  by using the  j k     1,1  rotating inversion line of nh3  in general  the cores are not spherically shaped  with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4  it is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars 
ammonia has been detected in the
and in one or possibly two molecular clouds  which are associated with the high-latitude galactic   the finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the population i metallicity b-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk 
observations of nearby dark clouds  
by balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission  it is possible to construct a relation between
and density  moreover  since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures  this calculation is fairly simple  this premise can be applied to dark clouds  regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation  detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow linesindicative not only of low temperatures  but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence  line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous co observations  the ammonia observations were consistent with co measurements of rotation temperatures of  10 k  with this  densities can be determined  and have been calculated to range between 104 and 105 cm3 in dark clouds  mapping of nh3 gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1
and masses near 1 solar mass  these cold  dense cores are the sites of future star formation 
uc hii regions  
ultra-compact hii regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation  the dense material surrounding uchii regions is likely primarily molecular  since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed  ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material  since this molecular material can be spatially resolved  it is possible to constrain the heating ionising sources  temperatures  masses  and sizes of the regions  doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars 
extragalactic detection  
ammonia has been detected in external galaxies  and by simultaneously measuring several lines  it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies  line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm   50 k   originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc  this picture is consistent with the picture within our
galaxyhot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc  giant molecular clouds  gmcs
