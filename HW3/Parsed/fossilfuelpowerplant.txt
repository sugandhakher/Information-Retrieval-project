coal-fired power stations
a fossil-fuel power station is a
which burns
such as  
or
to produce   central station fossil-fuel power plants are designed on a large scale for continuous operation  in many countries  such plants provide most of the electrical energy used  fossil-fuel power stations have machinery to convert the heat energy of
into   which then operates an   the
may be a   a
or  in small plants  a reciprocating
engine  all plants use the energy extracted from expanding gas  either steam or combustion gases  very few
have been built which directly convert the energy of moving hot gas into electricity 
byproducts of thermal power plant operation must be considered in their design and operation 
energy  which remains due to the finite efficiency of the     or
power cycle  is released directly to the atmosphere or river lake water  or indirectly to the atmosphere using a
with river or lake water used as a cooling medium  the
from combustion of the fossil fuels is discharged to the air  this gas contains
and water vapor  as well as other substances such as
 nox  
 sox     traces of other metals  and  for coal-fired plants    solid waste ash from coal-fired boilers must also be removed  some coal ash can be recycled for building materials 
fossil fueled power stations are major emitters of
 co2   a
which according to a
is a contributor to   the results of a recent study show that the
available to shareholders of large companies could see a significant reduction from the
liability related to only natural disasters in the u s  from a single coal-fired power plant  however  as of 2015  no such cases have awarded damages in the u s  per unit of electric energy 
emits nearly two times as much co2 as natural gas  and black coal emits somewhat less than brown

basic concepts  
in a fossil fuel power plant the chemical energy stored in fossil fuels such as    
or
and
of the
is converted successively into  
and  finally    each fossil fuel power plant is a complex  custom-designed system  construction costs  as of 2004  run to 1,300 per   or  650 million for a 500
unit    multiple generating units may be built at a single site for more efficient use of  
and   most
in the world use fossil fuel  outnumbering       or
plants 
heat into mechanical energy  
the
states that any
can only convert a fraction of the heat produced during combustion into   the rest of the heat  called   must be released into a cooler environment during the return portion of the cycle  the fraction of heat released into a cooler medium must be equal or larger than the ratio of
of the cooling system  environment  and the heat source  combustion furnace   raising the furnace temperature improves the efficiency but complicates the design  primarily by the selection of alloys used for construction  making the furnace more expensive  the waste heat cannot be converted into mechanical energy without an even cooler cooling system  however  it may be used in
plants to heat buildings  produce hot water  or to heat materials on an industrial scale  such as in some   plants  and
plants 
typical thermal efficiency for utility-scale electrical generators is around 33  for coal and oil-fired plants  and 56  60   lhv  for
gas-fired plants  plants designed to achieve peak efficiency while operating at capacity will be less efficient when operating off-design  i e  temperatures too low  
practical fossil-fuel stations operating as heat engines cannot exceed the
limit for conversion of heat energy into useful work 
do not have the same thermodynamic limits as they are not heat engines 
temperature of hot steam  using the reported efficiencies and the efficiency of an ideal
one can estimate the engine temperature  this estimate is the minimum heat water steam temperature as we neglect other losses  for example  the effective temperature of the cooling water can be significantly higher  assume the cold temperature

coal  
diagram of a typical steam-cycle coal power plant  proceeding from left to right 
coal is the most abundant
on the planet  it is a relatively cheap fuel  with some of the largest deposits in regions that are relatively stable politically  such as  
and the   this contrasts with
and   the largest deposits of which are located in the politically volatile   solid coal cannot directly replace natural gas or petroleum in most applications  petroleum is mostly used for
and the natural gas not used for
is used for  
and industrial heating  coal can be converted to gas or liquid fuel  but the efficiencies and economics of such processes can make them unfeasible    vehicles or heaters may require modification to use coal-derived fuels  coal can produce more
than petroleum or natural gas 
as of 2009 the largest coal-fired power station is
in   the world s most energy-efficient coal-fired power plant is the
in  
fuel transport and delivery  
in
in the united states 
coal-fired power plants provide about 39 percent of consumed electricity in the united states  as of march 2016  this is the
near  
coal is delivered by highway      
ship or   some plants are even built near coal mines and coal is delivered by conveyors  a large coal
called a  unit train  may be two kilometers  over a mile  long  containing 130-140 cars with 100
of coal in each one  for a total load of over 15,000 tons  a large plant under full load requires at least one coal delivery this size every day  plants may get as many as three to five trains a day  especially in  peak season  during the hottest summer or coldest winter months  depending on local climate  when power consumption is high  a large thermal power plant such as the one in   ontario stores several million metric tons of coal for winter use when the lakes are frozen 
modern unloaders use rotary dump devices  which eliminate problems with coal freezing in bottom dump cars  the unloader includes a train positioner arm that pulls the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper  the dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down to dump the coal  swiveling couplers enable the entire operation to occur while the cars are still coupled together  unloading a unit train takes about three hours 
shorter trains may use railcars with an  air-dump   which relies on air pressure from the engine plus a  hot shoe  on each car  this  hot shoe  when it comes into contact with a  hot rail  at the unloading trestle  shoots an electric charge through the air dump apparatus and causes the doors on the bottom of the car to open  dumping the coal through the opening in the trestle  unloading one of these trains takes anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half  older unloaders may still use manually operated bottom-dump rail cars and a  shaker  attached to dump the coal  generating stations adjacent to a mine may receive coal by
or massive -drive  
a collier  cargo ship carrying coal  may hold 40,000 long tons of coal and takes several days to unload  some colliers carry their own conveying equipment to unload their own bunkers  others depend on equipment at the plant  colliers are large  seaworthy  self-powered ships  for transporting coal in calmer waters  such as rivers and lakes  flat-bottomed vessels called
are often used  barges are usually unpowered and must be moved by
or  
for start up or auxiliary purposes  the plant may use fuel oil as well  fuel oil can be delivered to plants by    
or truck  oil is stored in vertical cylindrical steel tanks with capacities as high as 90,000 barrels  14,000m3   worth  the
no  5  bunker  and no  6 fuels are typically steam-heated before pumping in cold climates 
fuel processing  
coal is prepared for use by crushing the rough coal to pieces less than 2 inches  5cm  in size  the coal is then transported from the storage yard to in-plant storage silos by rubberized
at rates up to 4,000 short tons per hour 
in plants that burn pulverized coal  silos feed coal
 coal mills  that take the larger 2-inch  51mm  pieces  grind them to the consistency of   sort them  and mix them with primary combustion air which transports the coal to the boiler furnace and preheats the coal in order to drive off excess moisture content  a 500 mwe plant may have six such pulverizers  five of which can supply coal to the furnace at 250 tons per hour under full load 
in plants that do not burn pulverized coal  the larger 2-inch  51mm  pieces may be directly fed into the silos which then feed either mechanical distributors that drop the coal on a traveling grate or the
burners  a specific kind of combustor that can efficiently burn larger pieces of fuel

ge h series power generation gas turbine
currant creek power plant near
is a
fired electrical plant 
one type of fossil fuel power plant uses a
in conjunction with a
 hrsg   it is referred to as a
power plant because it combines the
of the gas turbine with the
of the hrsg  the thermal efficiency of these plants has reached a record
of 5690 btu  kwh   or just under 60   at a facility in baglan bay  wales 
the turbines are fueled either with natural gas 
or fuel oil  while more efficient and faster to construct  a 1,000 mw plant may be completed in as little as 18 months from start of construction   the economics of such plants is heavily influenced by the volatile cost of fuel  normally natural gas  the combined cycle plants are designed in a variety of configurations composed of the number of gas turbines followed by the steam turbine  for example  a 3-1 combined cycle facility has three gas turbines tied to one steam turbine  the configurations range from  1-1    2-1    3-1    4-1    5-1   to  6-1   
simple-cycle or open cycle gas turbine plants  without a steam cycle  are sometimes installed as emergency or
capacity  their thermal efficiency is much lower  the high running cost per hour is offset by the low capital cost and the intention to run such units only a few hundred hours per year  other gas turbine plants are installed in stages  with an open cycle gas turbine the first stage and additional turbines or conversion to a closed cycle part of future project plans 
switch to natural gas  
in the 1990s was the
where 30 gas-fired power stations were built in britain due to plentiful gas supplies from   according to the 2012 forecast by the u s  energy information administration  27 gigawatts of capacity from coal-fired generators is to be retired from 175 us coal-fired power plants before 2016  natural gas showed a corresponding jump  increasing by a third over 2011  some
such as the 1200 mw
have stopped burning coal by switching the plant to natural gas  coal s share of electricity generation dropped to just over 36   natural gas accounted for 81  of new power generation in the us between 2000 and 2010  coal-fired generation puts out about twice the amount of carbon dioxide - around 2,000 pounds for every megawatt hour generated - than electricity generated by burning natural gas at 1,100 pounds of
per megawatt hour  as the fuel mix in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation  carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen  carbon dioxide measured in the first quarter of 2012 was the lowest recorded of any year since 1992  the
has over 100 power stations that generate between 100mw and 5,600mw of electricity  natural gas plants are increasing in popularity and in 2014 generated 22  of the worlds total electricity 
reciprocating engines  
generator sets are often used for prime power in communities not connected to a widespread power grid  emergency  standby  power systems may use reciprocating internal combustion engines operated by fuel oil or natural gas  standby generators may serve as emergency power for a factory or data center  or may also be operated in parallel with the local utility system to reduce peak power demand charge from the utility  diesel engines can produce strong torque at relatively low rotational speeds  which is generally desirable when driving an   but diesel fuel in long-term storage can be subject to problems resulting from water accumulation and   rarely used generator sets may correspondingly be installed as natural gas or lpg to minimize the fuel system maintenance requirements 
spark-ignition internal combustion engines operating on gasoline  petrol     or
are commonly used as portable temporary power sources for construction work  emergency power  or recreational uses 
reciprocating external combustion engines such as the
can be run on a variety of fossil fuels  as well as renewable fuels or industrial waste heat  installations of stirling engines for power production are relatively uncommon 
environmental impacts  
the   a 1,580
coal power station near   out of service since 2005 due to environmental restrictions
the
are expected to rise 60  by 2030  world organizations and international agencies  like the iea  are concerned about the   and coal in particular  the combustion of coal contributes the most to
and   and has been connected with   due to the chemical composition of coal there are difficulties in removing impurities from the solid fuel prior to its combustion  modern day coal power plants pollute less than older designs due to new    technologies that filter the exhaust air in smoke stacks  however emission levels of various pollutants are still on average several times greater than natural gas power plants  in these modern designs  pollution from coal-fired power plants comes from the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide    and
into the air 
acid rain is caused by the emission of
and   these gases may be only mildly acidic themselves  yet when they react with the atmosphere  they create acidic compounds such as  
and
which fall as rain  hence the term acid rain  in europe and the u s a   stricter emission laws and decline in heavy industries have reduced the environmental hazards associated with this problem  leading to lower emissions after their peak in 1960s

carbon dioxide  
main article 
in   the world s largest carbon dioxide emitter
electricity generation using carbon based fuels is responsible for a large fraction of carbon dioxide  co2  emissions worldwide and for 34  of u s  man-made carbon dioxide emissions in 2010  in the u s  70  of electricity generation is produced from combustion of fossil fuels 
of the fossil fuels  coal is much more carbon intensive than oil or natural gas  resulting in greater volumes of
emissions per unit of electricity generated  in 2010  coal contributed about 81  of co2 emissions from generation and contributed about 45  of the electricity generated in the united states  in 2000  the carbon intensity of u s  coal thermal combustion was 2249lbs mwh  1,029kg mwh  while the carbon intensity of u s  oil thermal generation was 1672lb mwh  758kg mwh or 211kg   and the carbon intensity of u s  natural gas thermal production was 1135lb mwh  515kg mwh or 143kg gj  
the intergovernmental panel on climate change  see   states that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and that increased quantities within the atmosphere will  very likely  lead to higher average temperatures on a global scale     concerns regarding the potential for such warming to change the global climate prompted ipcc recommendations calling for large cuts to co2 emissions worldwide 
emissions may be reduced through more efficient and higher combustion temperature and through more efficient production of electricity within the cycle 
 ccs  of emissions from coal-fired power stations is another alternative but the technology is still being developed and will increase the cost of fossil fuel-based production of electricity  ccs may not be economically viable  unless the price of emitting co2 to the atmosphere rises 
particulate matter  
another problem related to coal combustion is the emission of
that have a serious impact on public health  power plants remove particulate from the flue gas with the use of a
or   several newer plants that burn coal use a different process 
in which
is made out of a reaction between coal and water  the synthesis gas is processed to remove most pollutants and then used initially to power gas turbines  then the hot exhaust gases from the gas turbines are used to generate steam to power a steam turbine  the pollution levels of such plants are drastically lower than those of  classic  coal power plants 
particulate matter from coal-fired plants can be harmful and have negative health impacts  studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter is related to an increase of respiratory and cardiac mortality  particulate matter can irritate small airways in the lungs  which can lead to increased problems with asthma  chronic bronchitis  airway obstruction  and gas exchange 
there are different types of particulate matter  depending on the chemical composition and size  the dominant form of particulate matter from coal-fired plants is   but secondary sulfate and nitrate also comprise a major portion of the particulate matter from coal-fired plants  coal fly ash is what remains after the coal has been combusted  so it consists of the incombustible materials that are found in the coal 
the size and chemical composition of these particles affects the impacts on human health  currently coarse  diameter greater than 2.5 m  and fine  diameter between 0.1 m and 2.5 m  particles are regulated  but ultrafine particles  diameter less than 0.1 m  are currently unregulated  yet they pose many dangers  unfortunately much is still unknown as to which kinds of particulate matter pose the most harm  which makes it difficult to come up with adequate legislation for regulating particulate matter 
there are several methods of helping to reduce the particulate matter emissions from coal-fired plants  roughly 80  of the ash falls into an ash hopper  but the rest of the ash then gets carried into the atmosphere to become coal-fly ash  methods of reducing these emissions of particulate matter include 
a
an
 esp 
the baghouse has a fine filter that collects the ash particles  electrostatic precipitators use an electric field to trap ash particles on high-voltage plates  and cyclone collectors use centrifugal force to trap particles to the walls  a recent study indicates that sulfur emissions from fossil fueled power stations in china may have caused a 10-year lull in global warming  1998-2008 
radioactive trace elements  
coal is a sedimentary rock formed primarily from accumulated plant matter  and it includes many inorganic minerals and elements which were deposited along with organic material during its formation  as the rest of the earth s   coal also contains low levels of     and other naturally occurring
whose release into the environment leads to radioactive contamination  while these substances are present as very small trace impurities  enough coal is burned that significant amounts of these substances are released  a 1,000 mw coal-burning power plant could have an uncontrolled release of as much as 5.2 metric tons per year of uranium  containing 74 pounds  34kg  of   and 12.8 metric tons per year of thorium  in comparison  a 1,000 mw nuclear plant will generate about 30 metric tons of high-level radioactive solid packed waste per year  it is estimated that during 1982  us coal burning released 155 times as much uncontrolled radioactivity into the atmosphere as the   the collective radioactivity resulting from all coal burning worldwide between 1937 and 2040 is estimated to be 2,700,000 curies or 0.101 ebq  during normal operation  the effective dose equivalent from coal plants is 100 times that from nuclear plants  normal operation however  is a deceiving baseline for comparison  just the
released  in iodine-131 alone  an estimated 1.76 ebq   of radioactivity  a value one order of magnitude above this value for total emissions from all coal burned within a century  while the iodine-131  the major radioactive substance which comes out in accident situations  has a half life of just 8 days 
water and air contamination by coal ash  
a study released in august 2010 that examined state pollution data in the united states by the organizations   the
and
found that coal ash produced by coal-fired power plants dumped at sites across 21 u s  states has contaminated ground water with toxic elements  the contaminants including the poisons
and  
arsenic has been shown to cause  
and   and lead damages the   coal ash contaminants are also linked to respiratory diseases and other health and developmental problems  and have disrupted local aquatic life  coal ash also releases a variety of toxic contaminants into nearby air  posing a health threat to those who breath in fugitive coal dust 
currently  the epa does not regulate the disposal of coal ash  regulation is up to the states and the electric power industry has been lobbying to maintain this status quo  most states require no monitoring of drinking water near coal ash dump sites  the study found an additional 39 contaminated u s  sites and concluded that the problem of coal ash-caused water contamination is even more extensive in the united states than has been estimated  the study brought to 137 the number of ground water sites across the united states that are contaminated by power plant-produced coal ash 
mercury contamination  
main article 
u s  government scientists tested fish in 291 streams around the country for   they found mercury in every fish tested  according to the study by the   they found mercury even in fish of isolated rural waterways  twenty five percent of the fish tested had mercury levels above the safety levels determined by the
for people who eat the fish regularly  the largest source of mercury contamination in the united states is coal-fueled power plant emissions 
greening of fossil fuel power plants  
main articles 
and
further information 
several methods exist to improve the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants  a frequently used and cost-efficient method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel  this includes conversions for biomass and waste  conversions to waste-fired power plants have the benefit of reducing   in addition  waste-fired power plants can be equipped with material recovery  which is also beneficial to the environment  in some instances 
of biomass may be needed if biomass is the material the converted fossil fuel power plant will be using 
improving energy efficiency of a coal-fired power plant also reduces emissions  for example  emissions can be reduced by upgrading existing plants or building new high-efficiency  low-emissions plants  such plants emit almost 20  less co2 than a subcritical unit operating at a similar load  over the longer term  hele plants can further facilitate emission reductions because coal-fired plants operating at the highest efficiencies are also the most appropriate option for
retrofit 
regardless of the conversion  a truly low-carbon fossil fuel power plant implements carbon capture and storage  which means that the exhaust co2 is not released into the environment and the fossil fuel power plant becomes an     a 2006 example of a carbon capture and storage fossil fuel power plant is the pilot elsam power station near esbjerg  denmark 
low nox burners  
a common retrofit in fossil fueled power stations is the replacement of original burners with low nox burners  careful consideration of fluid dynamics and flame thermodynamics has enabled substantial reduction in flame temperature  leading to reduced formation of nitrous oxides 
clean coal  
is a process whereby coal is chemically washed of
and impurities  sometimes   burned and the resulting flue gases treated with steam  with the purpose of removing sulfur dioxide  and reburned so as to make the carbon dioxide in the flue gas economically recoverable  the coal industry uses the term  clean coal  to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction  preparation and use  but has provided no specific quantitative limits on any emissions  particularly carbon dioxide  whereas contaminants like sulfur or mercury can be removed from coal  carbon cannot be effectively removed while still leaving a usable fuel  and clean coal plants without carbon sequestration and storage do not significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
in an open letter to u s  president
has advocated a  moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store co2   in his book   similarly  hansen discusses his declaration of stewardship the first principle of which requires  a moratorium on coal-fired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide  
combined heat and power  
 chp   also known as   is the use of a power station to provide both electric power and process heat or   while rejecting heat at a higher than normal temperature to enable building heating lowers overall plant electric power efficiency  the extra fuel burnt is more than offset by the reduction in fossil fuel that would otherwise be used for heating buildings  this technology is widely practiced in for example denmark  other scandinavian countries and parts of germany  calculations show that chpdh is the cheapest method of carbon emissions reductions 
alternatives to fossil fuel power plants  
it has been suggested that this section be
out into another article      november 2015 
u s  2014 electricity generation by type 
alternatives to fossil fuel power plants include           hydroelectric power    
and other
 see    some of these are proven technologies on an industrial scale  i e  nuclear  wind  tidal  hydroelectric and biomass fired power  others are still in prototype form 
nuclear power  and geothermal power may be classed as heat pollutants as they add heat energy to the biosphere that would not otherwise be released    the net quantity of energy conversion within the biosphere due to the utilisation of wind power  solar power  tidal power  hydroelectric power  hydroelectricity  is static and is derived from the effects of sunlight and the movement of the moon and planets 
generally  the cost of electrical energy produced by non fossil fuel burning power plants is greater than that produced by burning fossil fuels  this statement however only includes the cost to produce the electrical energy and does not take into account indirect costs associated with the many pollutants created by burning fossil fuels  e g  increased hospital admissions due respiratory diseases caused by fine smoke particles  
relative cost by generation source  
see also 
when comparing power plant costs  it is customary to start by calculating the cost of power at the generator terminals by considering several main factors  external costs such as connections costs  the effect of each plant on the distribution grid are considered separately as an additional cost to the calculated power cost at the terminals 
initial factors considered are 
capital costs  including waste disposal and decommissioning costs for nuclear energy 
operating and maintenance costs 
fuel costs for fossil fuel and biomass sources  and which may be negative for wastes 
likely annual hours per year run or load factor  which may be as low as 30  for wind energy  or as high as 90  for nuclear energy 
offset sales of heat  for example in combined heat and power district heating  chp dh  
these costs occur over the 3050 year life of the fossil fuel power plants  using   in general large fossil plants are attractive due to their low initial capital coststypically around 7501000 per kilowatt electrical compared to perhaps 1500 per kilowatt for onshore wind
