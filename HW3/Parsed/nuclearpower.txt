health and safety concerns  the 1979   and the 1986
played a part in stopping new plant construction in many countries  although the public policy organization  the
states that new nuclear units  at the time of publishing in 2006  had not been built in the u s  because of soft demand for electricity  and
on nuclear plants due to regulatory issues and construction delays  by the end of the 1970s it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly as dramatically as once believed  eventually  more than 120 reactor orders in the u s  were ultimately cancelled and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt  a cover story in the february 11  1985  issue of
magazine commented on the overall failure of the u s  nuclear power program  saying it  ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history  
unlike the three mile island accident  the much more serious chernobyl accident did not increase regulations affecting western reactors since the chernobyl reactors were of the problematic
design only used in the soviet union  for example lacking  robust    many of these rbmk reactors are still in use today  however  changes were made in both the reactors themselves  use of a safer enrichment of uranium  and in the control system  prevention of disabling safety systems   amongst other things  to reduce the possibility of a duplicate accident 
an international organization to promote safety awareness and professional development on operators in nuclear facilities was created    world association of nuclear operators 
opposition in ireland and poland prevented nuclear programs there  while austria  1978   sweden  1980  and italy  1987   influenced by chernobyl  voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power  in july 2009  the italian parliament passed a law that cancelled the results of an earlier referendum and allowed the immediate start of the italian nuclear program  after the

the world nuclear association has said that  nuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year   data from the international atomic energy agency showed that nuclear power plants globally produced 2346 twh of electricity in 2012  seven per cent less than in 2011  the figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 japanese power reactors producing no power during the year  the permanent closure of eight reactor units in germany was also a factor  problems at crystal river  fort calhoun and the two san onofre units in the usa meant they produced no power for the full year  while in belgium doel 3 and tihange 2 were out of action for six months  compared to 2010  the nuclear industry produced 11  less electricity in 2012 
post-fukushima controversy
eight of the seventeen operating reactors in germany were permanently shut down as part of  
the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident sparked controversy about the importance of the accident and its effect on nuclear s future  iaea director general yukiya amano said the japanese nuclear accident  caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power   and the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035  but by 2015  the agency s outlook had become more promising   nuclear power is a critical element in limiting greenhouse gas emissions   the agency noted  and  the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the  fukushima-daiichi  accident   it is still the second-largest source worldwide of low-carbon electricity  and the 72 reactors under construction at the start of last year were the most in 25 years   though
reported in 2011 that  the crisis at japan s fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world   progress energy chairman ceo bill johnson made the observation that  today theres an even more compelling case that greater use of nuclear power is a vital part of a balanced energy strategy   in 2011  the economist opined that nuclear power  looks dangerous  unpopular  expensive and risky   and that  it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works   earth institute director jeffrey sachs disagreed  claiming combating climate change would require an expansion of nuclear power   we won t meet the carbon targets if nuclear is taken off the table   he said   we need to understand the scale of the challenge  
investment banks were critical of nuclear soon after the accident  many disputed their impartiality  however  due to significant investments in renewable energy  perceived by some as a valid alternative to nuclear  in early april 2011  analysts at swiss-based investment bank ubs said   at fukushima  four reactors have been out of control for weeks  casting doubt on whether even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety   we believe the fukushima accident was the most serious ever for the credibility of nuclear power   ubs has helped to raise more than  20 billion since 2006 and advised on more than a dozen deals for renewable energy and cleantech companies 
advised that  the global impact of the fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health  safety  security  and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways   renewable energy will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems  a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks

analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of environmental sustainability
and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely  from the electric grid of the world  has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in france and sweden during each nation s building programs in the 1980s  within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely   allow ing  the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets    in a similar analysis  brook had earlier determined that 50  of all   that is not solely electricity  but transportation
etc  could be generated within approximately 30 years  if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation s already proven decadal rates in units of installed  
per year  per unit of global  gw year    
this is in contrast to the completely conceptual paper-studies for a
world  which would require an
more costly global investment per year  which has no historical precedent  having never been attempted due to its prohibitive cost  along with far greater land that would need to be devoted to the wind  wave and solar projects  and the inherent assumption that humanity will use less  and not more  energy in the future  as brook notes the  principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical  economic or fuel-related  but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance  fiscal and political inertia  and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing  the other  low-carbon alternatives

where many of the risks associated with construction costs  operating performance  fuel price  accident liability and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers  in addition  because the potential liability from a nuclear accident is so great  the full cost of liability insurance is generally limited capped by the government  which the
concluded constituted a significant subsidy  many countries have now liberalized the
where these risks  and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered  are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers  which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants 
following the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  costs are expected to increase for currently operating and new nuclear power plants  due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats 
the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject  since there are diverging views on this topic  and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source  comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants as well as the future costs of fossil fuels and renewables as well as for energy storage solutions for intermittent power sources  cost estimates also need to take into account

the future of nuclear power varies greatly between countries  depending on government policies  some countries  many of them in europe  such as germany  belgium  and lithuania  have adopted policies of   at the same time  some asian countries  such as china  south korea  and india  have committed to rapid expansion of nuclear power  many other countries  such as the united kingdom and the united states  have policies in between  japan was a major generator of nuclear power before the fukushima accident  but as of august 2016  japan has restarted only three of its nuclear plants  and the extent to which it will resume its nuclear program is uncertain 
in 2015  the international energy agency reported that the fukushima accident had a strongly negative effect on nuclear power  yet the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the accident  the iea noted that at the start of 2014  there were 72 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide  the largest number in 25 years  and that china planned to increase nuclear power capacity from 17 gigawatts  gw  in 2014  to 58 gw in 2020 
in 2016  the us energy information administration projected for its base case that world nuclear power generation would increase from 2,344 billion kw-hr in 2012 to 4,501 billion kw-hr in 2040  most of the predicted increase was expected to be in asia 
the nuclear power industry in western nations has a history of construction delays    plant cancellations  and nuclear safety issues despite   in december 2013  forbes magazine cited a report which concluded that  in western countries   reactors are not a viable source of new power   even where they make economic sense  they are not feasible because nuclears  enormous costs  political and   and regulatory uncertainty   this view echoes the statement of former exelon ceo   who said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the united states  dont make any sense right now  and wont be economically viable in the foreseeable future    economics professor  also says the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable  quiggin says that we need more
and more   former nrc member
and professor
made similar statements in 2011  however  some  nuclear cheerleaders  and lobbyists in the west continue to champion reactors  often with proposed new but largely untested designs  as a source of new power 
much more new build activity is occurring in developing countries like south korea  india and china  in march 2016  china had 30 reactors in operation  24 under construction and plans to build more  however  according to a government research unit  china must not build  too many nuclear power reactors too quickly   in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel  equipment and qualified plant workers 
in the us  licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60years  two new
are under construction at   a dual construction project which marks the end of a 34-year period of stagnation in the us construction of civil nuclear power reactors  the station operator licenses of almost half the present 104 power reactors in the us  as of 2008  have been given   as of 2012  u s  nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020  all at existing plants  in 2013  four aging  uncompetitive  reactors were permanently closed  relevant state legislatures are trying to close
and  
the u s  nrc and the u s  department of energy have initiated research into
which is hoped will lead to allowing extensions of reactor licenses beyond 60 years  provided that safety can be maintained  as the loss in non-co2-emitting generation capacity by retiring reactors  may serve to challenge u s  energy security  potentially resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions  and contributing to an imbalance between electric supply and demand  
there is a possible impediment to production of nuclear power plants as only a few companies worldwide have the capacity to forge single-piece reactor pressure vessels  which are necessary in the most common reactor designs  utilities across the world are submitting orders years in advance of any actual need for these vessels  other manufacturers are examining various options  including making the component themselves  or finding ways to make a similar item using alternate methods 
according to the   globally during the 1980s one new nuclear reactor started up every 17days on average  and in the year 2015 it was estimated that this rate could in theory eventually increase to one every 5days  although no plans exist for that  as of 2007 
in tennessee  which came on-line on february 7  1996  was the last u s  commercial nuclear reactor to go on-line  this is often quoted as evidence of a successful worldwide campaign for nuclear power phase-out    fossil fuel price increases  global warming  and heavy metal emissions from fossil fuel use  new technology such as passively safe plants  and national energy security may renew the demand for nuclear power plants

life cycle of nuclear fuel
the nuclear fuel cycle begins when uranium is mined  enriched  and manufactured into nuclear fuel   1  which is delivered to a   after usage in the power plant  the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant  2  or to a final repository  3  for geological disposition  in
95  of spent fuel can potentially be recycled to be returned to usage in a power plant  4  
main article 
a nuclear reactor is only part of the life-cycle for nuclear power  the process starts with mining  see    uranium mines are underground    or
mines  in any case  the uranium ore is extracted  usually converted into a stable and compact form such as   and then transported to a processing facility  here  the yellowcake is converted to   which is then
using various techniques  at this point  the enriched uranium  containing more than the natural 0.7  u-235  is used to make
of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for  the fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles  typically 6 years total now  inside the reactor  generally until about 3  of their uranium has been fissioned  then they will be moved to a
where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away  after about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle  and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed

is a fairly common
in the earth s crust  uranium is approximately as common as
or
in the earth s crust  and is about 40times more common than silver  uranium is present in trace concentrations in most rocks  dirt  and ocean water  but can be economically extracted currently only only where it is present in high concentrations  still  the world s present measured resources of uranium  economically recoverable at the arbitrary price ceiling of 130usd kg  are enough to last for between 70 and 100 years 
according to the
in 2006  there was an expected 85 years worth of uranium in already identified resources  when that uranium is used in   in the oecd s red book of 2011  due to increased exploration  known uranium resources have grown by 12.5  since 2008  with this increase translating into greater than a century of uranium available if the metals usage rate were to continue at the 2011 level  the oecd also estimate 670 years of economically recoverable uranium in total conventional resources and
ores  while also using present reactor technology  a resource that is recoverable from between 60-100 us  kg of uranium  in a similar manner to every other natural metal resource  for every tenfold increase in the cost per kilogram of uranium  there is a three-hundredfold increase in available lower quality ores that would then become economical  as the oecd note 
even if the nuclear industry expands significantly  sufficient fuel is available for centuries  if advanced
could be designed in the future to efficiently utilize recycled or depleted uranium and all actinides  then the resource utilization efficiency would be further improved by an additional factor of eight 
for example  the oecd have determined that with a pure
fuel cycle with a burn up of  and recycling of  all the uranium and   actinides which presently make up the most hazardous substances in   there is 160,000 years worth of uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ore  at the price of 60-100 us  kg of uranium

can make this waste reusable  and more efficient reactor designs  such as the currently under construction
achieve a higher efficiency burn up of the available resources  than the current vintage   which make up the vast majority of reactors worldwide

as opposed to current light water reactors which use uranium-235  0.7  of all natural uranium   fast breeder reactors use uranium-238  99.3  of all natural uranium   it has been estimated that there is up to five billion years  worth of uranium-238 for use in these power plants 
breeder technology has been used in several reactors  but the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely  at 2006 technological levels  requires uranium prices of more than 200 usd kg before becoming justified economically  breeder reactors are still however being pursued as they have the potential to burn up all of the
in the present inventory of nuclear waste while also producing power and creating additional quantities of fuel for more reactors via the breeding process  in 2005  there were two breeder reactors producing power  the
in france  which has since powered down in 2009 after 36 years of operation  and the   a reactor constructed in 1980 beloyarsk  russia which is still operational as of 2013  the electricity output of bn-600 is 600 mw  russia plans to expand the nation s use of breeder reactors with the   was scheduled to become operational in 2014  but due to delays is not scheduled to produce power until 2017  the technical design of a yet larger breeder  the
was originally scheduled to be finalized in 2013  with construction slated for 2015 but has also been delayed  japan s
breeder reactor restarted  having been shut down in 1995  in 2010 for 3 months  but shut down again after equipment fell into the reactor during reactor checkups  it is planned to become re-operational in late 2013  both china and india are building breeder reactors  with the indian 500 mwe
scheduled to become operational in 2014  with plans to build five more by 2020  the
began producing power in 2011 
another alternative to fast breeders is thermal breeder reactors that use uranium-233 bred from
as fission fuel in the   thorium is about 3.5 times more common than uranium in the earth s crust  and has different geographic characteristics  this would extend the total practical fissionable resource base by 450

high-level radioactive waste

following interim storage in a   the bundles of used fuel assemblies of a typical nuclear power station are often stored on site in the likes of the eight

high-level radioactive waste management concerns management and disposal of highly radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power  the technical issues in accomplishing this are daunting  due to the extremely long periods
remain deadly to living organisms  of particular concern are two  
 half-life 220,000 years  and
 half-life 15.7 million years   which dominate spent nuclear fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years  the most troublesome
in spent fuel are
 half-life two million years  and
 half-life 24,000 years   consequently  high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the   this usually necessitates treatment  followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage  disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form 
governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options  usually involving deep-geologic placement  although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions  this is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years  according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses 
some proposed nuclear reactor designs however such as the american
and the
can use the nuclear waste from light water reactors as a fuel  transmutating it to isotopes that would be safe after hundreds  instead of tens of thousands of years  this offers a potentially more attractive alternative to deep geological disposal 
another possibility is the use of thorium in a reactor especially designed for thorium  rather than mixing in thorium with uranium and plutonium  i e  in existing reactors   used thorium fuel remains only a few hundreds of years radioactive  instead of tens of thousands of years 
since the fraction of a radioisotope s atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life  the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes  such as the decay chains of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are
over the crust s 3   1019 ton mass   for instance  over a timeframe of thousands of years  after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed  burying u s  nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the united states  10 million km2  by
1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of
in such a volume  although the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average 
low-level radioactive waste

the nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated items like clothing  hand tools  water purifier resins  and  upon decommissioning  the materials of which the reactor itself is built  in the us  the nuclear regulatory commission has repeatedly attempted to allow low-level materials to be handled as normal waste  landfilled  recycled into consumer items  etcetera 
comparing radioactive waste to industrial toxic waste
in countries with nuclear power  radioactive wastes comprise less than 1  of total industrial toxic wastes  much of which remains hazardous for long periods  overall  nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants  coal-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal  a 2008 report from
concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation  and that the population
equivalent  or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is 100 times as much as from the operation of nuclear plants  indeed  coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis  but coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated  and this is released directly into the environment as   whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials  for example  in
vessels 
waste disposal
disposal of nuclear waste is often said to be the achilles  heel of the industry  presently  waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate  some experts suggest that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed  guarded  and monitored  would be a vast improvement  there is an  international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in    with the lack of movement of nuclear waste in the 2 billion year old
in  
being cited as  a source of essential information today  
there are no commercial scale purpose built underground repositories in operation  the
 wipp  in
has been taking nuclear waste since 1999 from production reactors  but as the name suggests is a research and development facility  a radiation leak at wipp in 2014 brought renewed attention to the need for r d on disposal or radioactive waste and spent fuel 
reprocessing
for more details on this topic  see  
reprocessing can potentially recover up to 95  of the remaining uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel  putting it into new   this produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste  since this is largely short-lived fission products  and reduces its volume by over 90   reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in europe  russia  japan  and india  the full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires breeder reactors  which are not commercially available 
nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste  but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository  reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to   the potential vulnerability to   the political challenges of repository siting  a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel   and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle  several different methods for reprocessing been tried  but many have had safety and practicality problems which have led to their discontinuation 
in the united states  the obama administration stepped back from president bush s plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research  reprocessing is not allowed in the u s  in the u s   spent nuclear fuel is currently all treated as waste  a major recommendation of the
was that  the united states should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste

in terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated  nuclear power has caused fewer accidental deaths per unit of energy generated than all other major sources of energy generation  energy produced by coal  petroleum  natural gas and
has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated  from air pollution and   this is found in the following comparisons  when the immediate nuclear related deaths from accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from these other energy sources  when the latent  or predicted  indirect cancer deaths from nuclear
are compared to the immediate deaths from the above energy sources  and when the combined immediate and indirect fatalities from nuclear power and all fossil fuels are compared  fatalities resulting from the mining of the necessary natural resources to power generation and to air pollution  with these data  the use of nuclear power has been calculated to have prevented in the region of 1.8 million deaths between 1971 and 2009  by reducing the proportion of energy that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuels  and is projected to continue to do so 
although according to benjamin k  sovacool  fission energy accidents ranked first in terms of their total economic cost  accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents  analysis presented in the international journal  human and ecological risk assessment found that coal  oil 
and hydroelectric accidents primarily due to the

explained that serious impacts of nuclear accidents were often not directly attributable to radiation exposure  but rather social and psychological effects  evacuation and long-term displacement of affected populations created problems for many people  especially the elderly and hospital patients  but long-term displacement is not a unique feature to nuclear accidents  with hydropower and lignite surface mining projects routinely displacing thousands during normal  non-accident  operations  e g

terrorists could target
in an attempt to release
into the community  the united states 9/11 commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the
attacks  an attack on a reactors
could also be serious  as these pools are less protected than the reactor core  the release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities 
if nuclear power use is to expand significantly  nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community  new reactor designs have features of   such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators  but these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents  not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group  however  the us
does now also require new reactor license applications to consider security during the design stage  in the united states  the nrc carries out  force on force   fof  exercises at all nuclear power plant  npp  sites at least once every three years  in the u s   plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored  the plant grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards

nuclear proliferation
many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability  in that they can be used to make
if a country chooses to do so  when this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon or a public annex to a  secret  weapons program  the concern over
is a case in point 
united states and  russian
stockpiles  1945-2006 the
was the main driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended  however without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for
fuel  the cost of dismantling has dissuaded russia from continuing their disarmament 
a fundamental goal for american and global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power  if this development is  poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful  the nuclear future will be dangerous   the
is one such international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy  would receive
at a discounted rate  in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program  the france-based  european gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment consortium was is one such program that successfully implemented this concept  with
and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the french controlled enrichment facility  but without a transfer of technology  iran was an early participant from 1974  and remains a shareholder of eurodif via  
according to benjamin k  sovacool  a  number of high-ranking officials  even within the united nations  have argued that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons   a 2009 united nations report said that 
the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies  which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons 
on the other hand  one factor influencing the support of power reactors is due to the appeal that these reactors have at reducing nuclear weapons arsenals through the   a program which eliminated 425 metric tons of  heu   the equivalent of 17,000 nuclear warheads  by diluting it with
making it equivalent to  leu   and thus suitable as nuclear fuel for commercial fission reactors  this is the single most successful
program to date 
the megatons to megawatts program  the brainchild of thomas neff of   was hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended  however without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel  the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded russia from continuing their disarmament 
currently  according to harvard professor matthew bunn   the russians are not remotely interested in extending the program beyond 2013  we ve managed to set it up in a way that costs them more and profits them less than them just making new low-enriched uranium for reactors from scratch  but there are other ways to set it up that would be very profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in boosting their nuclear exports  
up to 2005  the megatons to megawatts program had processed  8 billion of heu weapons grade uranium into leu reactor grade uranium  with that corresponding to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons 
for approximately two decades  this material generated nearly 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the united states  about half of all us nuclear electricity generated  with a total of around 7 trillion
of electricity produced  enough energy to energize the entire united states electric grid for about two years  in total it is estimated to have cost  17 billion  a  bargain for us ratepayers   with russia profiting  12 billion from the deal  much needed profit for the   which after the collapse of the   had difficulties paying for the maintenance and security of the russian federations highly enriched uranium and warheads

this presently infrequent generic problem may become increasingly significant over time  this can force nuclear reactors to be shut down  as happened in france during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves  nuclear power supply was severely diminished by low river ow rates and droughts  which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling reactors  during the heat waves  17 reactors had to limit output or shut down  77  of french electricity is produced by nuclear power and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8gw shortage and forced the french government to import electricity  other cases have been reported from germany  where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production only 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007  in particular 
the
reduced output by 90  between june and september 2003
the
cut production by 60  for 14 days due to excess river temperatures and low stream ow in the river isar in 2006 however the more modern isar ii station did not have to cut production  as unlike its sister station isar i  isar ii was built with a cooling tower 
similar events have happened elsewhere in europe during those same hot summers  if global warming continues  this disruption is likely to increase or alternatively  station operators could instead retro-fit other means of cooling  like   despite these frequently being large structures and therefore sometimes unpopular with the public 
comparison with renewable energy
see also        and
as of 2013  the world nuclear association has said  there is unprecedented interest in renewable energy  particularly solar and wind energy  which provide electricity without giving rise to any carbon dioxide emission  harnessing these for electricity depends on the cost and efficiency of the technology  which is constantly improving  thus reducing costs per peak kilowatt  
production  from sources such as
and   is frequently criticized for being intermittent or  
like nuclear energy  renewable electricity supply  of primarily   in the 20-50   range has already been implemented in several european systems  albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system  in 2012  the share of electricity generated by all types of renewable sources in germany was 21.9   compared to 16.0  for nuclear power after germany shut down 7-8 of its 18 nuclear reactors in 2011  in the united kingdom  the amount of energy produced from renewable energy is expected to exceed that from nuclear power by 2018  and scotland plans to obtain all electricity from renewable energy by 2020  the majority of installed renewable energy across the world is in the form of  
the
has said that if governments were supportive  and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed  renewable energy supply could account for almost 80  of the world s energy use within forty years    chairman of the ipcc  said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1  of global gdp annually  this approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million  the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible 
in 2014 
published the net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies which states  after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis  that  the net benefits of new nuclear  hydro  and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants   with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power 
similarly  analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of environmental sustainability
and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely  from the electric grid of the world  has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in france and sweden during each nation s building programs in the 1980s  within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely   allow ing  the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets    in a similar analysis  brook had earlier determined that 50  of all   that is not solely electricity  but transportation
etc  could be generated within approximately 30 years  if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation s already proven decadal rates in units of installed  
per year  per unit of global  gw year    
this is in contrast to the completely conceptual paper-studies for a
world  which would require an
more costly global investment per year  which has no historical precedent  having never been attempted due to its prohibitive cost  along with far greater land that would have to be devoted to the wind  wave and solar projects  and the inherent assumption that humanity will use less  and not more  energy in the future  as brook notes the  principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical  economic or fuel-related  but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance  fiscal and political inertia  and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing  the other  low-carbon alternatives  
while the
reactor designs has followed an increasing trend due to
and
whereas the
is declining for wind power  in about 2011  wind power became as inexpensive as natural gas    and anti-nuclear groups have suggested that in 2010 solar power became cheaper than nuclear power  data from the
in 2011 estimated that in 2016  solar will have a levelized cost of electricity almost twice that of nuclear  21 kwh for solar  11.39 kwh for nuclear   and wind somewhat less  9.7 kwh   however  the us
has also cautioned that levelized costs of intermittent sources such as wind and solar are not directly comparable to costs of  dispatchable  sources  those that can be adjusted to meet demand   as intermittent sources need costly large-scale back-up power supplies for when the weather changes 
a 2010 study by the global subsidies initiative compared global relative   or government financial aid to different energy sources  with this aid not solely funnelled into
but into bribing or   results show that fossil fuels receive about 1 us cents per kwh of energy they produce  nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents   kwh  renewable energy  excluding hydroelectricity  receives 5.0 cents   kwh and biofuels receive 5.1 cents   kwh in subsidies 
there is however no small volume of intensely radioactive spent fuel that needs to be stored or reprocessed with conventional renewable energy sources  a nuclear plant needs to be disassembled and removed  much of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low level nuclear waste for a few decades  however  from a safety stand point  nuclear power  in terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered  is comparable to and in some cases  lower than many renewable energy sources 
nuclear decommissioning
the financial costs of every nuclear power plant continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity  once no longer economically viable  nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally   returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses  such as   after a cooling-off period that may last decades  reactor core materials are dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for interim storage or
experiments  the consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive  but it has the potential to be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error  accidents or sabotage 
in the usa a
and nuclear decommissioning trust fund is legally required  with utilities banking 0.1 to 0.2 cents kwh during operations to fund future decommissioning  they must report regularly to the
on the status of their decommissioning funds  about 70  of the total estimated cost of decommissioning all us nuclear power reactors has already been collected  on the basis of the average cost of  320 million per reactor-steam turbine unit  
in the u s  in 2011  there are 13 reactors that had permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning  with
and
having completed the process in 2006-2007  after ceasing commercial electricity production circa 1992  the majority of the 15 years  was used to allow the station to naturally
on its own  which makes the manual disassembly process both safer and cheaper decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming 
working under an
framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the   the brussels supplementary convention  and the
and in the u s  the   it is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity  but the cost is small  amounting to about 0.1  of the levelized cost of electricity  according to a cbo study 
these beyond-regular-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power  as
plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the
disaster  where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died  or large
in general  as private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios  major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state 
debate on nuclear power
main article 
see also      and
the nuclear power debate concerns the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes  the debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s  when it  reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies   in some countries   
proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a
source that reduces
and increases
by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources  proponents claim that nuclear power produces virtually no conventional air pollution  such as greenhouse gases and smog  in contrast to the chief viable alternative of   nuclear power can produce
power unlike many renewables which are
lacking large-scale and cheap ways of storing energy 
saw oil as a resource that would   and proposed nuclear energy as a replacement energy source  proponents claim that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors  and the operational safety record in the western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants 
opponents believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment  these threats include the problems of processing  transport and storage of radioactive nuclear waste  the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism  as well as health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining  they also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong  and there have been serious   critics do not believe that the risks of using nuclear fission as a power source can be fully offset through the development of new technology  they also argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the
are considered  from uranium mining to   nuclear power is neither a low-carbon nor an economical electricity source

current fission reactors in operation around the world are second or third generation systems  with most of the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago  research into advanced generation iv reactor types was officially started by the generation iv international forum  gif  based on eight technology goals  including to improve nuclear safety  improve proliferation resistance  minimize waste  improve natural resource utilization  the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity  and decrease the cost to build and run such plants  most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors  and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030 
the nuclear reactors to be built at vogtle are new
third generation reactors  which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors  however  john ma  a senior structural engineer at the nrc  is concerned that some parts of the ap1000 steel skin are so brittle that the  impact energy  from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall  edwin lyman  a senior staff scientist at the   is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the ap1000 
the union of concerned scientists has referred to the   currently under construction in china  finland and france  as the only new reactor design under consideration in the united states that     appears to have the potential to be significantly safer and more secure against attack than today s reactors  
one disadvantage of any new reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design  nuclear engineer
has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology  he argues that  the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold  scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations  and humans make mistakes   as one director of a u s  research laboratory put it   fabrication  construction  operation  and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve  advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes  the technology may be proven  but people are not  
hybrid nuclear fusion-fission
is a proposed means of generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes  the concept dates to the 1950s  and was briefly advocated by
during the 1970s  but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009  due to delays in the realization of pure fusion  when a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built  it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel  reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude  and more importantly  eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel  substances which cause security concerns 
nuclear fusion
main articles 
and
reactions have the potential to be safer and generate less radioactive waste than fission  these reactions appear potentially viable  though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant  fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s 
construction of the
facility began in 2007  but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns  the facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027  11 years after initially anticipated  a follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station    has been proposed  there are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach  that of an  
fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable  as fission-electric power had been  however  the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and
led to projections being extended by several decades  in 2010  more than 60 years after the first attempts  commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050
