flue gas from london s   1975
flue gas is the
exiting to the atmosphere via a   which is a pipe or channel for conveying exhaust gases from a fireplace  oven   
or   quite often  the flue gas refers to the
exhaust gas produced at   its composition depends on what is being burned  but it will usually consist of mostly
 typically more than two-thirds  derived from the combustion of air 
 co2   and
as well as excess
 also derived from the combustion air   it further contains a small percentage of a number of pollutants  such as
 like        and  
scrubbing  
at power plants  flue gas is often treated with a series of chemical processes and   which remove pollutants 
or
remove particulate matter and
captures the
produced by burning fossil fuels  particularly coal  nitrogen oxides are treated either by modifications to the combustion process to prevent their formation  or by high temperature or catalytic reaction with
or   in either case  the aim is to produce nitrogen gas  rather than nitrogen oxides  in the united states  there is a rapid deployment of technologies to remove
from flue gastypically by
on sorbents or by capture in inert solids as part of the
product  such scrubbing can lead to meaningful recovery of sulfur for further industrial use 
technologies based on regenerative capture by
for the removal of co2 from flue gas have been deployed to provide high purity co2 gas to the food industry  and for   they are now under active research as a method for co2 capture for long-term storage as a means of   and have begun to be implemented in a limited way commercially  e g  the
in the   operating since 1996  
there are a number of proven technologies for removing pollutants emitted from power plants that are now available  there is also much ongoing research into technologies that will remove even more air pollutants
