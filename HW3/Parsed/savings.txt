or valuable material   this includes the core meaning as held in the originating old english word weal  which is from an
word stem  an individual  community  region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy 
the modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of   and clearly so for
and
yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent  at the most general level  economists may define wealth as  anything of value  that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept  various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts  defining wealth can be a
process with various
implications  since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own

wealth  
  in his seminal work   described wealth as  the annual produce of the land and labour of the society   this  produce  is  at its simplest  that which satisfies human needs and wants of   in popular usage  wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic   or the state of controlling or possessing such items  usually in the form of  
and personal   an individual who is considered wealthy  affluent  or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group 
in economics 
refers to the value of
owned minus the value of
owed at a point in time    wealth can be categorized into three principal categories    including homes or automobiles  monetary savings  such as the accumulation of past   and the
wealth of income producing assets  including       and     all these delineations make wealth an especially important part of   wealth provides a type of individual safety net of protection against an unforeseen decline in one s living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership  business ownership  or even a college education   
 wealth  refers to some accumulation of resources  net asset value   whether abundant or not   richness  refers to an abundance of such resources  income or flow   a wealthy individual  community  or nation thus has more accumulated resources  capital  than a poor one  the opposite of wealth is destitution  the opposite of richness is  
the term implies a

in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner  the concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies  but varies between different sections or regions in the same society  a personal
of us  10,000 in most parts of the united states would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale  however  such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished  
concepts of wealth also vary across time  modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the
have vastly improved the standard of living in modern societies for even the poorest of people  this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future  given this trend   of human advancement  it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations

saw wealth creation as the combination of materials  labour  land  and technology in such a way as to capture a profit  excess above the cost of production   the theories of       in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call  
economics  see   distinguishes in the
between material wealth and human wealth  defining human wealth as  wealth in human relations   land and labour were the source of all material wealth  the german cultural historian silvio vietta links wealth poverty to rationality  having a leading position in the development of rational sciences  in new technologies and in economic production leads to wealth  while the opposite can be correlated with  
amount of wealth in the world  
the wealth of households amounts to usd 241
 2013  and is estimated to increase by 40  in five years  the u s  net worth of  100 trillion and switzerland s usd 0.51 million inhabitant are the highest numbers in the world 
the credit suisse wealth report  mid-2013  estimated that  once debts had been subtracted  an adult required just usd 4,000 in assets to be within the wealthiest 50  of world citizens  however  at least usd 75,000 was needed to reach the top 10   and usd 753,000 to belong to the most wealthy 1  
has asserted that a small child has greater wealth than the 2 billion poorest people in the world combined  since a small child has no debt 
philosophical analysis  
in western civilization  wealth is connected with a quantitative type of thought  invented in the ancient greek  revolution of rationality   involving for instance the quantitative analysis of nature  the rationalization of warfare  and measurement in economics  the invention of coined money and banking was particularly important  aristotle describes the basic function of money as a universal instrument of quantitative measurement  for it measures all things    making things alike and comparable due to a social  agreement  of acceptance  in that way  money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities  in the roman empire  just as in modern colonialism  the main force behind the conquest of countries was the exploitation and accumulation of wealth in quantitative values like gold and money  modern philosophers like nietzsche criticized the fixation on measurable wealth   unsere reichen   das sind die rmsten  der eigentliche zweck alles reichtums ist vergessen    our  rich people   those are the poorest  the real purpose of all wealth has been forgotten  
economic analysis  
 savings  redirects here  for the concept of non-expenditure of income per unit of time  see  
in   wealth  in a commonly applied
sense   sometimes savings  is the
of a person  household  or nation  that is  the value of all
owned net of all
owed at a point in time  for national wealth as measured in the   the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world  the term may also be used more broadly as referring to the productive capacity of a society or as a contrast to   analytical emphasis may be on its determinants or  
economic terminology distinguishes between wealth and income  wealth or savings is a
variable  that is  measurable at a date in time  for example the value of an orchard on december 31 minus debt owed on the orchard  for a given amount of wealth  say at the beginning of the year 
from that wealth  as measurable over say a year is a
variable  what marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time  such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year 
in
theory the    may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth  one measure of it is the   it is the percentage change in the amount demanded of
for each one-percent change in wealth 
wealth may be measured in   that is in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes  the assets include those that are tangible   and   and financial  money  bonds  etc    measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as
and   in economics   wealth  corresponds to the
term     but analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting  such as in    an example of the latter is

projected future outlays considered to be liabilities  macroeconomic questions include whether the issuance of government bonds affects

through the

wealth and social class  
is not identical to wealth  but the two concepts are related  particularly in    leading to the combined concept of   wealth refers to value of everything a person or family owns  this includes tangible items such as jewelry  housing  cars  and other personal property  financial assets such as stocks and bonds  which can be traded for cash  also contribute to wealth  wealth is measured as net assets  minus how much debt one owes  wealth is a restrictive agent for people of different classes because some hobbies can only be participated in by the affluent  such as world travel 
partly as a result of different economic conditions of life  members of different
often have different value systems and view the world in different ways  as such  there exist different  conceptions of social reality  different aspirations and hopes and fears  different conceptions of the desirable   the way the various social classes in society view wealth vary and these diverse characteristics are a fundamental dividing line among the classes  according to richard h ropers  the
is inequitably distributed  in 1996  the united states federal government reported that the net worth of the top 1 percent of people in the united states was approximately equal to that of the bottom 90 percent  cross-nationally  the united states has greater wealth inequality than other developed nations   
the upper class  
upper class encompasses the top end of the income spectrum relative members of society as a whole  since they have more wealth and privacy  the upper class has more personal autonomy than the rest of the population 
values include higher education  and the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth  the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks  children of the upper class are typically schooled on how to manage this power and channel this privilege in different forms  it is in large part by accessing various edifices of information    associates  procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations  usually  people of the upper class participate as partisans in elections and have more political power than those of lower classes due to their abundance of resources and influence 
the middle class  
middle class encompasses the individuals who fall in between the upper and lower class relative to their financial situation  generally  the population of america associates themselves as middle class  lifestyle is a means for which individuals or families decide what to consume with their money and their way of living  the middle class places a greater emphasis on income  unlike the upper class  the middle class measures success and potential in the form of money  relative pennies  rather than influence and power  the
views wealth as something for emergencies and it is seen as more of a cushion  this class comprises people that were raised with families that typically owned their own home  planned ahead and stressed the importance of education and achievement  they earn a significant amount of income and also have significant amounts of consumption  however  there is very limited savings  deferred consumption  or investments  besides retirement
and home ownership  they have been socialized to accumulate wealth through structured  institutionalized arrangements  without this set structure  asset accumulation would likely not occur 
the lower class  
those with the least amount of wealth are the poor  most of the institutions that the poor encounter discourage any accumulation of assets  lower class members feel more restrictive in their options due to their lack of wealth  this could lead to complications in solving their personal dilemmas  as predicted by the class structure hypothesis  there are many societal standards and designs intentional sabotage and shortcomings to explain the persistent state of yearning and want the lower classes generally experience with their lower quality and quantity of assets  typical causes are persistent unethical harmful mentalities and criminal tendencies  misguidedly similar to the upper class in some cases 
distribution  
main article 
although precise data are not available  the total
in the world  excluding   has been estimated at  125
 usd 1251012  in year 2000  including human capital  the united nations estimated it in 2008 to be  118 trillion in the united states alone  according to the kuznets hypothesis  inequality of wealth and income increases during the early phases of economic development  stabilizes and then becomes more equitable 
about 90  of global wealth is distributed in north america  europe  and  rich   countries  not including india   and in 2008  1  of adults were estimated to hold 40  of world wealth  a number which falls to 32  when adjusted for  
in 2013  1  of adults were estimated to hold 46  of world wealth and around  18.5
was estimated to be stored in
worldwide
