power-to-x  also p2x and p2y  has two meanings  first  power-to-x refers to a number of
    and reconversion pathways that utilize surplus   typically during periods where fluctuating
generation exceeds load  second  power-to-x refers to conversion technologies that allow for the decoupling of power from the electricity sector for use in other sectors  such as transport or chemicals   possibly using power that has been provided by additional investments in generation  the term power-to-x is widely used in
and may have originated there 
the x in the terminology can refer to one of the following  power-to-  power-to-  power-to-    power-to-    power-to-    power-to-mobility  power-to-power  and power-to- 
collectively power-to-x schemes which use surplus power fall under the heading of flexibility measures and are particularly useful in energy systems with high shares of renewable generation and or with strong
targets  a large number of pathways and technologies are encompassed by the term  in 2016 the german government funded a 30million first-phase research project into power-to-x options

electricity storage concepts  
surplus electric power can be converted to other forms of
for storage and reconversion  direct current
can be used to produce
which can  in turn  be converted to
 ch4  via   these fuels can be stored and used to produce electricity again  hours to months later  reconversion technologies include     and   power-to-power refers to the round-trip reconversion efficiency  electrolysis is expensive and power-to-gas processes need substantial full-load hours  say 30   to be economic  grid-dedicated
is not normally considered a power-to-x concept 
sector coupling concepts  
hydrogen and methane can also be used as downstream   feed into the
grid  or used to make or   alternatively they can be used as a chemical   as can
   
power-to-heat involves contributing to the heat sector  either by
or via a   back-up immersion heating of both
and
offers a cheap way of using surplus renewable energy and will often displace carbon-intensive fossil fuels for the task 
power-to-mobility refers to the charging of
 ev   given the expected uptake of evs  dedicated dispatch will be required
