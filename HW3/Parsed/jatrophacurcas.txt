jatropha curcas
jatropha curcas is a species of
in the
family    that is native to the
  most likely
and   it is cultivated in tropical and
regions   becoming
in some areas  the    curcas   was first used by
doctor
more than 400 years ago and is of uncertain origin  common names include barbados nut  purging nut  physic nut  or jcl  abbreviation of jatropha curcas   
j  curcas is a   semi-

botanical features  
  the leaves have significant variability in their morphology  in general  the leaves are green to pale green  alternate to subopposite  and three- to five-lobed with a  
  male and female flowers are produced on the same   averaging 20 male flowers to each female flower  or 10 male flowers to each female flower  the petiole length ranges from 6.123.1 mm  the inflorescence can be formed in the   plants are
and also presents hermaphroditic flowers occasionally 
  fruits are produced in winter  or there may be several crops during the year if soil moisture is good and temperatures are sufficiently high  most fruit production is concentrated from midsummer to late fall with variations in production peaks where some plants have two or three harvests and some produce continuously through the season 
  the seeds are mature when the capsule changes from green to yellow  the seeds contain around 20  saturated fatty acids and 80  unsaturated fatty acids  and they yield 25 40  oil by weight  in addition  the seeds contain other chemical compounds  such as             and   the oil is largely made up of oleic and
acids  furthermore  the plant also contains curcasin  arachidic      and
acids and  
  the whole genome was sequenced by kazusa dna research institute  chiba japan in october 2010 
cultivation  
jatropha curcas seeds
cultivation is uncomplicated  jatropha curcas grows in
and
regions  the plant can grow in
and grows on almost any terrain  even on  
and
  it can thrive in poor and stony soils  although new research suggests that the plant s ability to adapt to these poor soils is not as extensive as had been previously stated  complete
is achieved within 9 days  adding
during the germination has negative effects during that phase  but is favorable if applied after germination is achieved  it can be propagated by cuttings  which yields faster results than multiplication by seeds 
the flowers only develop terminally  at the end of a stem   so a good ramification  plants presenting many branches  produces the greatest amount of fruits  the plants are   another productivity factor is the ratio between female and male flowers within an inflorescence  more female flowers mean more fruits  jatropha curcas thrives on a mere 250mm  10in  of rain a year  and only during its first two years does it need to be watered in the closing days of the dry season 
and planting are not needed regularly  as this shrub has a life expectancy of approximately forty years  the use of
is not necessary  due to the pesticidal and
properties of the plant  it is used in rural bengal for
 a common fungal infection of the skin  
while jatropha curcas starts yielding from 9-12 months time  the best yields are obtained only after 23 years time  the seed production is around 3.5 tons per hectare  seed production ranges from about 0.4 t ha in the first year to over 5 t ha after 3 years   if planted in   the reported productivity of jatropha is from 0.8 to 1.0kg of seed per meter of live fence   
propagation  
jatropha curcas has limited natural vegetative propagation and is usually propagated by   propagation through seed  sexual propagation  leads to a lot of genetic variability in terms of growth  biomass  seed yield and oil content  low seed viability and the recalcitrant nature of oil seeds also limit seed propagation  however  clonal techniques can help in overcoming these problems that hinder mass propagation of this tree-borne oilseed species  vegetative propagation has been achieved by    
as well as by
techniques  the investigation leads to the recommendation that cuttings should be taken preferably from juvenile plants and treated with 200 micro gram per litre of
   to ensure the highest level of rooting in stem cuttings  these vegetative methods have potential for commercial propagation of these plants

jatropha crude oil 
processing  
seed extraction is made simple with the use of the   an
designed by the  
oil content varies from 28  to 30  and 80  extraction  one
of plantation will give 400 to 600 litres of oil if the soil is average 
the oily seeds are processed into   which may be used directly      to fuel combustion engines or may be subjected to
to produce   jatropha oil is not suitable for human consumption  as it induces strong
and  
a
can also be derived from the seed   
uses  
biofuel  
jatropha plantation in the dry center west of the
when jatropha seeds are crushed  the resulting jatropha oil can be processed to produce a high-quality
or
that can be used in a standard diesel car or further processed into jet fuel  while the residue    can also be used as biomass feedstock to power electricity plants  used as fertilizer  it contains nitrogen  phosphorus and potassium   or as animal   the cake can also be used as feed in
and gasifiers to produce biogas 
 from planting to harvest  treat the jatropha plant as well as possible to make the harvest as large as possible    a reference to the compulsory planting of jatropha in indonesia for the production of oil as machinery lubricant and fuel for the japanese wwii war effort  
there are several forms of biofuel  often manufactured using     and   the fats and oils are turned into esters while separating the   at the end of the process  the glycerin settles and the biofuel floats  the process through which the glycerin is separated from the biodiesel is known as   glycerin is another by-product from jatropha oil processing that can add value to the crop  transesterification is a simple chemical reaction that neutralizes the free fatty acids present in any fatty substances in jatropha  a chemical exchange takes place between the
groups of an ester compound by an alcohol  usually 
and
are used for the purpose  the reaction occurs by the presence of a   usually sodium hydroxide  naoh  or caustic soda and potassium hydroxide  koh   which forms fatty esters  e g   methyl or ethyl esters   commonly known as   it takes approximately 10  of methyl alcohol by weight of the fatty substance to start the transesterification process 
estimates of jatropha seed yield vary widely  due to a lack of research data  the
diversity of the crop  the range of
in which it is grown  and jatropha s perennial life cycle  seed yields under cultivation can range from 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms per   corresponding to extractable oil yields of 540 to 680
per
 58 to 73
per    in 2009 time magazine cited the potential for as much as 1,600 gallons of diesel fuel per acre per year  the plant may yield more than four times as much fuel per
as   and more than ten times that of
 corn   but at the same time it requires five times as much water per unit of energy produced as does corn  see below   a hectare of jatropha has been claimed to produce 1,892 litres of fuel  however  as it has not yet been domesticated or improved by plant breeders  yields are variable 
jatropha can also be
with other cash crops such as coffee  sugar  fruits and vegetables 
in 2007
cited jatropha curcas as one of the best candidates for future biodiesel production  however  despite its abundance and use as an oil and
plant  none of the jatropha species has been properly
and  as a result  its productivity is variable  and the long-term impact of its large-scale use on soil quality and the environment is unknown 
in 2008 researchers at daimler chrysler research explored the use of jatropha oil for automotive use  concluding that although jatropha oil as fuel  has not yet reached optimal quality      it already fulfills the eu norm for biodiesel quality    
and
have a joint project to develop jatropha as a biofuel  three mercedes cars powered by jatropha diesel have already put some 30,000 kilometres behind them  the project is supported by
and by the german association for investment and development  deutschen investitions- und entwicklungsgesellschaft  deg  
jet fuel  
aviation fuels may be more widely replaced by biofuels such as jatropha oil than fuels for other forms of transportation  there are fewer planes than cars or trucks and far fewer jet fueling stations to convert than gas stations

carbon dioxide sequestration  
according to a 2013 study published by the   the jatropha tree may have applications in the absorption of carbon dioxide  whose sequestration is important in combating climate change  this small tree is very resistant to aridity so it can be planted in hot and dry land in soil unsuitable for food production  the plant does need water to grow though  so coastal areas where desalinated seawater can be made available are ideal   
use in developing world  
currently the oil from jatropha curcas
is used for making
fuel in  
and in   where it grows naturally and in plantations in the southeast  north  and northeast of brazil  likewise  jatropha oil is being promoted as an easily grown biofuel crop in hundreds of projects throughout india and other developing countries  large plantings and nurseries have been undertaken in india by many research institutions  and by women s
groups who use a system of
to ease poverty among semiliterate indian women  the

of   where a native variety  jatropha matacensis  also grows  studies have shown the suitability of jatropha cultivation and agro producers are starting to consider planting in the region 
burma  
is also actively pursuing the use of jatropha oil  on 15 december 2005  then-head of state  senior general   said the states and divisions concerned are to put 50,000 acres  200 km  under the physic nut plants  jatropha  each within three years totalling 700,000 acres  2,800 km  during the period  on the occasion of burmas peasant day 2006  than shwe described in his a message that for energy sector which is an essential role in transforming industrial agriculture system  the government is encouraging for cultivation of physic nut plants nationwide and the technical know how that can refine physic nuts to biodiesel has also identified  he would like to urge peasants to cultivate physic nut plants on a commercial scale with major aims for emergence of industrial agriculture system  for fulfilling rural electricity supply and energy needs  for supporting rural areas development and import substitute economy   2005 from mrtv 
in 2006  the chief research officer at state-run
said burma hoped to completely replace the country s oil imports of 40,000 barrels a day with home-brewed  jatropha-derived biofuel  other government officials declared burma would soon start exporting jatropha oil  despite the military s efforts  the jatropha campaign apparently has largely flopped in its goal of making burma self-sufficient in fuel   2006 from myawaddytv 
z g s  bioenergy has started jatropha plantation projects in northern   the company has begun planting jatropha plants during late june 2007 and will start producing seeds by 2010   20 july 2007 from new light of myanmar 
controversies  
as of 2011 skepticism about the  miracle  properties of jatropha has been voiced  for example   the idea that jatropha can be grown on marginal land is a    according to harry stourton  business development director of uk-based sun biofuels  which cultivates jatropha in mozambique and tanzania   it does grow on marginal land  but if you use marginal land you ll get marginal yields   he said 
an august 2010 article warned about the actual utility and potential dangers of reliance on jatropha in kenya  major concerns included its invasiveness  which could disrupt local biodiversity  as well as damage to water catchment areas 
jatropha curcas is lauded as being sustainable  and that its production would not compete with food production  but the jatropha plant needs water like every other crop to grow  this could create competition for water between the jatropha and other edible food crops  in fact  jatropha requires five times more water per unit of energy than sugarcane and corn 
other uses  
flowers
the species is listed as a
plant    hydrogen cyanide is present 
nuts
can be construed for home cooking fuel in briquette form replacing charcoalized timber as in haiti 
they can be burned like
when strung on grass   
is present   
used as a
in south sudan 
seeds
interest exists in producing animal feed   from the bio-waste once the oil is expressed  as in the case with haiti  where jatropha curcas grows prolifically and animal feed is in very short supply 
similarly  metsiyen in the haitian culture dates back as a medicinal crop - thus the name  metsiyen   medsiyen   some suggest it  calms the stomach  
some mention of metsiyen being used to ward off evil spirits in past haitian culture where voodoo has been losing adherents for christian faith 
also used as a contraceptive in south sudan 
the oil has been used for illumination      the
of   and making     also called sulphonated  or sulfated  castor oil  is the only oil that completely disperses in water  it is made by adding
to pure jatropha oil  it was the first synthetic
after ordinary   as this allows easy use for making bath oil products  it is used in formulating   softeners  and  
the seeds in the zone around misantla  veracruz are very appreciated by the population as food once they have been boiled and roasted  it is unclear if this is due to the existence of a non-toxic variety of jatropha in mexico and central america  or if the seeds become edible once processed by cooking 
it is also similarly reported that jatropha seeds are edible once the embryo has been removed  again it may be so because of these seeds coming from a local non-toxic variety
