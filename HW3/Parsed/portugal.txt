portugal ranks 12th in the best public health systems in the world  ahead of high developed countries like the united kingdom  germany or sweden 
the portuguese health system is characterized by three coexisting systems  the national health service  servio nacional de sade   sns   special social health insurance schemes for certain professions  health subsystems  and voluntary private health insurance  the sns provides universal coverage  in addition  about 25  of the population is covered by the health subsystems  10  by private insurance schemes and another 7  by mutual funds 
the ministry of health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the sns  five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives  developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery  decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level  in practice  however  the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care 
the sns is predominantly funded through general taxation  employer  including the state  and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems  in addition  direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding 
similar to the other eur-a countries  most portuguese die from   mortality from
 cvd  is higher than in the   but its two main components  ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease  display inverse trends compared with the eur-a  with
being the single biggest killer in portugal  17    portuguese people die 12  less often from cancer than in the eur-a  but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the eur-a  cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years  although lung cancer  slowly increasing among women  and breast cancer  decreasing rapidly  are scarcer  cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent  portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the eur-a  with a sharp increase since the 1980s 
the medical department of the  
portugal s
has dropped sharply since the late 1970s  when 24 of 1000 newborns died in the first year of life  it is now around 2 deaths per a 1000 newborns  this improvement was mainly due to the decrease in neonatal mortality  from 15.5 to 2.4 per 1000 live births 
people are usually well informed about their health status  the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services  yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations  thus  survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services 
only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in portugal  kasmel et al   2004   this is the lowest of the eur-a countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity

the first thing there is to understand is that in a good measure  the courts of cdiz created a new state  the spanish state      there had never been a proclamation of a kingdom of spain  so that difficulties always arose upon the legal value of the very frequent references to  spain  in the legal texts of the sixteenth  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  the spanish sovereigns had always refused the advice       in the sense of establishing a united kingdom of spain  preferring to see themselves as vertices of converging scattered kingdoms  at least in theory  even the napoleonic bayonne constitution of 1808 did not proclaim a kingdom of spain  but a  crown of spain and the indies   on the other hand   spain  was merely a geographical name  a simple romance version of  hispania  whereby its use  in principle  should not have to go beyond the designations galia germania
