alternative energy is any energy source that is an alternative to   these alternatives are intended to address concerns about such fossil fuels  such as its high carbon dioxide emissions  an important factor in        
and
are all alternative sources of energy 
the nature of what constitutes an alternative energy source has changed considerably over time  as have controversies regarding energy use  because of the variety of energy choices and differing goals of their advocates  defining some energy types as  alternative  is considered controversial

history  
historians of economies have examined the key transitions to alternative energies and regard the transitions as pivotal in bringing about significant economic change  prior to the shift to an alternative energy  supplies of the dominant energy type became erratic  accompanied by rapid increases in energy prices 
coal as an alternative to wood  
in the late medieval period  coal was the new alternative fuel to save the society from overuse of the dominant fuel  wood  the deforestation had resulted in shortage of wood  at that time soft coal appeared as a savior  historian
describes how 
 europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries  after 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 ad they were running short of wood for heating and cooking    by 1500 europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster   from  which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of potatoes and maize   
petroleum as an alternative to whale oil  
was the dominant form of lubrication and fuel for lamps in the early 19th century  but the
by mid century caused whale oil prices to skyrocket setting the stage for the adoption of petroleum which was first commercialized in
in 1859 
ethanol as an alternative to fossil fuels  
main article 
in 1917  alexander graham bell advocated ethanol from corn  wheat and other foods as an alternative to coal and oil  stating that the world was in measurable distance of depleting these fuels  for bell  the problem requiring an alternative was lack of renewability of orthodox energy sources  since the 1970s 
which has allowed the country to become the world s second largest producer of
 after the united states  and the world s largest exporter  brazils ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap
as feedstock  and the residual cane-waste    is used to process heat and power  there are no longer light vehicles in brazil running on pure gasoline  by the end of 2008 there were 35,000 filling stations throughout brazil with at least one ethanol pump 
can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks  and involves the use of the whole crop  this new approach should increase yields and reduce the
because the amount of energy-intensive fertilizers and fungicides will remain the same  for a higher output of usable material  as of 2008  there are nine
which are either operating  or under construction  in the united states 
technologies are able to manufacture biofuels from inedible biomass and could hence prevent conversion of food into fuel   as of july 2010  there is one commercial second-generation  2g  ethanol plant   which is operating in denmark 
coal gasification as an alternative to petroleum  
in the 1970s  president  s administration advocated
as an alternative to expensive imported oil  the program  including the
was scrapped when petroleum prices plummeted in the 1980s  the carbon footprint and environmental impact of coal gasification are both very high   
common types of alternative energy  
captures energy from falling water 
uses nuclear fission to release energy stored in the atomic bonds of heavy elements 
is the generation of electricity from wind  commonly by using propeller-like turbines 
is the use of sunlight  light can be changed into thermal  heat  energy and electric energy 
is the use of the earth s internal heat to boil water for heating buildings or generating electricity 
and
are plant-derived gasoline substitutes for powering vehicles 
can serve as a means of delivering energy produced by various technologies 
enabling technologies  
and
are technologies which use energy sources that are normally cost-prohibitive  also  heat pumps have the advantage of leveraging electrical power  or in some cases mechanical or thermal power  by using it to extract additional energy from a low-energy-density source  such as sea or lake water  the ground or the air  
thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from diurnal to   and can involve storage of
 i e  by changing the temperature of a medium  or
 e g  through phase changes of a medium  i e  changes from solid to liquid or vice versa   such as between water and slush or ice   energy sources can be natural  via solar-thermal collectors  or dry cooling towers used to collect winter s cold   waste energy  such as from hvac equipment  industrial processes or power plants   or surplus energy  such as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms   the
 alberta  canada  is illustrative 
allows the community to get 97  of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs  which most of the heat collected in summer  the storages can be insulated tanks  borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock  deep aquifers  or shallow pits that are lined and insulated  some applications require inclusion of a  
renewable energy vs non-renewable energy  
main article 
renewable energy is generated from such as      
and which are renewable  naturally replenished   when comparing the processes for producing energy  there remain several fundamental differences between renewable energy and fossil fuels  the process of producing oil  coal  or natural gas fuel is a difficult and demanding process that requires a great deal of complex equipment  physical and chemical processes  on the other hand  alternative energy can be widely produced with basic equipment and natural processes  wood  the most renewable and available alternative energy  burns the same amount of carbon it would emit if it degraded naturally  nuclear power is an alternative to fossil fuels that is non-renewable  like fossil fuels  nuclear ones are a finite resource 
ecologically friendly alternatives  
renewable energy sources such as burning
are sometimes regarded as a carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuels  renewables are not inherently alternative energies for this purpose  for example  the   once leader in use of
as a biofuel  has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use  may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels   the netherlands government and environmental groups are trying to trace the origins of imported palm oil  to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner  regarding biofuels from foodstuffs  the realization that converting the entire grain harvest of the us would only produce 16  of its auto fuel needs  and the decimation of brazil s co2 absorbing tropical rain forests to make way for biofuel production has made it clear that placing energy markets in competition with food markets results in higher food prices and insignificant or negative impact on energy issues such as global warming or dependence on foreign energy  recently  alternatives to such undesirable sustainable fuels are being sought  such as commercially viable sources of cellulosic ethanol

waste
recycled from   recovered from automotive   or derived from
in   commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce synthetic fuels for less than
fuels when oil costs more than  55 per barrel  renewable methanol  rm  is a fuel produced from
and carbon dioxide by catalytic
where the hydrogen has been obtained from   it can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock 
the

transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the
since 2011  it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year  a 250 kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the center for solar energy and hydrogen research  zsw  at
and the

has constructed a carbon-neutral
 lng  plant in   germany  the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their
automobiles  and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity  other commercial developments are taking place in     and   england

carbon related
such fuels are considered
because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric   to the extent that synthetic fuels displace   or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid  and their combustion is subject to
at the flue or exhaust pipe  they result in
and net
from the atmosphere  and thus constitute a form of  
such renewable fuels alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the
or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels  enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles  carbon-neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy   alleviating the problems of wind and solar   and they enable distribution of wind  water  and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines 
nighttime
is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the
for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  so  the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative  germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts 
algae fuel  
is a
which is derived from algae  during photosynthesis  algae and other photosynthetic organisms capture carbon dioxide and sunlight and convert it into oxygen and biomass  this is usually done by placing the algae between two panes of glass  the algae creates three forms of energy fuel  heat  from its growth cycle   biofuel  the natural  oil  derived from the algae   and biomass  from the algae itself  as it is harvested upon maturity  
the heat can be used to power building systems  such as heat process water  or to produce energy  biofuel is oil extracted from the algae upon maturity  and used to create energy similar to the use of   the biomass is the matter left over after extracting the oil and water  and can be harvested to produce combustible methane for energy production  similar to the warmth felt in a compost pile or the methane collected from biodegradable materials in a landfill  additionally  the benefits of algae biofuel are that it can be produced industrially  as well as vertically  i e  as a building facade   thereby obviating the use of arable land and food crops  such as soy  palm  and canola  
biomass briquettes  
are being developed in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal  the technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70  the calorific value of charcoal  there are relatively few examples of large scale briquette production  one exception is in north kivu  in eastern   where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to mountain gorilla habitat  the staff of
have successfully trained and equipped over 3500 people to produce biomass briquettes  thereby replacing charcoal produced illegally inside the national park  and creating significant employment for people living in extreme poverty in conflict affected areas 
biogas digestion  
digestion deals with harnessing the methane gas that is released when waste breaks down  this gas can be retrieved from garbage or sewage systems  biogas digesters are used to process methane gas by having bacteria break down
in an anaerobic environment 
the methane gas that is collected and refined can be used as an energy source for various products 
biological hydrogen production  
hydrogen gas is a completely clean burning fuel  its only by-product is water  it also contains relatively high amount of energy compared with other fuels due to its chemical structure 
2h2   o2  2h2o   high energy
high energy   2h2o  2h2   o2
this requires a high-energy input  making commercial hydrogen very inefficient  use of a biological vector as a means to split water  and therefore produce hydrogen gas  would allow for the only energy input to be solar radiation  biological vectors can include bacteria or more commonly algae  this process is known as   it requires the use of single celled organisms to create hydrogen gas through fermentation  without the presence of oxygen  also known as an anaerobic environment  regular cellular respiration cannot take place and a process known as fermentation takes over  a major by-product of this process is hydrogen gas  if we could implement this on a large scale  then we could take sunlight  nutrients and water and create hydrogen gas to be used as a dense source of energy  large-scale production has proven difficult  it was not until 1999 that we were able to even induce these anaerobic conditions by sulfur deprivation  since the fermentation process is an evolutionary back up  turned on during stress  the cells would die after a few days  in 2000  a two-stage process was developed to take the cells in and out of anaerobic conditions and therefore keep them alive  for the last ten years  finding a way to do this on a large-scale has been the main goal of research  careful work is being done to ensure an efficient process before large-scale production  however once a mechanism is developed  this type of production could solve our energy needs 
hydroelectricity  
provided 75  of the worlds renewable electricity in 2013  much of the electricity we use today is a result of the heyday of conventional hydroelectric development between 1960 and 1980  according to a report published in 2000 the 1990s dam construction has virtually ceased in europe and north america due to environmental concerns  globally there is a trend towards more hydroelectricity  from 2004 to 2014 the installed capacity rose from 715 to 1,055 gw  a popular alternative to the large dams of the past is
where there is no water stored behind a dam and generation usually varies with seasonal rainfall  using run-of-the-river in wet seasons and solar in dry seasons can balance seasonal variations for both 
in recent years  we discovered the advantage from falling water  the theory of hydroelectric is to build a dam on a large river that has a large drop in elevation  the dam store lots of water behind it in the reservoir  near the bottom of the dam wall  there is the water intake  gravity causes it to fall through the penstock inside the dam  at the end of the penstock  there is a turbine propeller  which is turned by the moving water  the shaft from the turbine connected to the generator  which produces the power  power lines are connected to the generator that carry electricity to your home and mine  there are two advantages of hydroelectric power  to begin  low capital cost to produce energy because the water is an initial substance  next  it emits less greenhouse gases since water is green chemical 
offshore wind  
offshore
are similar to regular wind farms  but are located in the ocean  offshore wind farms can be placed in water up to 40 metres  130ft  deep  whereas floating wind turbines can float in water up to 700 metres  2,300ft  deep  the advantage of having a floating wind farm is to be able to harness the winds from the open ocean  without any obstructions such as hills  trees and buildings  winds from the open ocean can reach up to speeds twice as fast as coastal areas 
significant generation of
already contributes to electricity needs in
and
and now the first offshore wind farms are under development in u s  waters  while the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades  especially in europe  there is still a great deal of uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the  
traditional offshore
are attached to the seabed in shallower waters within the nearshore marine environment  as offshore wind technologies become more advanced  floating structures have begun to be used in deeper waters where more wind resources exist

investing in alternative energy  
as an emerging economic sector  there are limited investment opportunities in alternative energy available to the general public  the public can buy shares of alternative energy companies from various stock markets  with wildly volatile returns  the recent ipo of solarcity demonstrates the nascent nature of this sector- within a few weeks  it already had achieved the second highest market cap within the alternative energy sector 
investors can also choose to invest in etfs  exchange-traded funds  that track an alternative energy index  such as the wilderhill new energy index  additionally  there are a number of mutual funds  such as calvert s global alternative energy mutual fund that are a bit more proactive in choosing the selected investments 
recently 
launched an online platform allowing residents of california and new york to invest directly in solar  investing in solar projects had previously been limited to accredited investors  or a small number of willing banks 
over the last three years publicly traded alternative energy companies have been very volatile  with some 2007 returns in excess of 100   some 2008 returns down 90  or more  and peak-to-trough returns in 2009 again over 100     in general there are three subsegments of alternative energy investment  solar energy  wind energy and hybrid electric vehicles  alternative energy sources which are renewable  free and have lower carbon emissions than what we have now are wind energy  solar energy  geothermal energy  and bio fuels  each of these four segments involve very different technologies and investment concerns 
for example  photovoltaic solar energy is based on semiconductor processing and accordingly  benefits from steep cost reductions similar to those realized in the microprocessor industry  i e   driven by larger scale  higher module efficiency  and improving processing technologies   pv solar energy is perhaps the only energy technology whose electricity generation cost could be reduced by half or more over the next 5 years  better and more efficient manufacturing process and new technology such as advanced thin film solar cell is a good example of that helps to reduce industry cost 
the economics of solar pv electricity are highly dependent on silicon pricing and even companies whose technologies are based on other materials  e g   first solar  are impacted by the balance of supply and demand in the silicon market    in addition  because some companies sell completed solar cells on the open market  e g   q-cells   this creates a low barrier to entry for companies that want to manufacture solar modules  which in turn can create an irrational pricing environment 
in contrast  because wind power has been harnessed for over 100 years  its underlying technology is relatively stable  its economics are largely determined by siting  e g   how hard the wind blows and the grid investment requirements  and the prices of steel  the largest component of a wind turbine  and select composites  used for the blades   because current wind turbines are often in excess of 100 meters high  logistics and a global manufacturing platform are major sources of competitive advantage  these issues and others were explored in a research report by sanford bernstein  some of its key conclusions are shown here 
alternative energy in transportation  
due to steadily rising gas prices in 2008 with the us national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas rising above  4.00 at one point  there has been a steady movement towards developing higher fuel efficiency and more
for consumers  in response  many smaller companies have rapidly increased research and development into radically different ways of powering consumer vehicles 
and
are commercially available and are gaining wider industry and consumer acceptance worldwide 
for example  nissan usa introduced the world s first mass-production electric vehicle     a plug-in hybrid car  the    also has been produced  using an electric motor to drive the wheels  and a small four-cylinder engine to generate additional electricity 
making alternative energy mainstream  
before alternative energy becomes mainstream there are a few crucial obstacles that it must overcome  first there must be increased understanding of how alternative energies work and why they are beneficial  secondly the availability components for these systems must increase  and lastly the pay-off time must be decreased 
for example 
 ev  and
 phev  are on the rise  these vehicles depend heavily on an effective charging infrastructure such as a
infrastructure to be able to implement electricity as mainstream alternative energy for future transportations   
research  
there are numerous organizations within the academic  federal  and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of alternative energy  this research spans several areas of focus across the alternative energy spectrum  most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields 
multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on alternative energy in recent years  two of the most prominent of these labs are
and the
 nrel   both of which are funded by the
and supported by various corporate partners  sandia has a total budget of  2.4 billion while nrel has a budget of  375 million 
mechanical energy  
mechanical energy associated with human activities such as blood circulation  respiration  walking  typing and running etc  is ubiquitous but usually wasted  it has attracted tremendous attention from researchers around the globe to find methods to scavenge such mechanical energies  the best solution currently is to use piezoelecric materials  which can generate flow of electrons when deformed  various devices using piezoelectric materials have been built to scavenge mechanical energy  considering that the piezoelectric constant of the material plays a critical role in the overall performance of a piezoelectric device  one critical research direction to improve device efficiency is to find new material of large piezoelectric response  lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate  pmn-pt  is a next-generation piezoelectric material with super high piezoelectric constant when ideal composition and orientation are obtained  in 2012  pmn-pt nanowires with a very high piezoelectric constant were fabricated by a hydro-thermal approach and then assembled into an energy-harvesting device  the record-high piezoelectric constant was further improved by the fabrication of a single-crystal pmn-pt nanobelt  which was then used as the essential building block for a piezoelectric nanogenerator 
solar  
main article 
can be used for  
or electrical power generation using the sun 
solar heat has long been employed in
and
heated buildings  as well as district heating systems  examples of the latter are the
is alberta  canada and numerous district systems in denmark and germany  in europe  there are two programs for the application of solar heat  the solar district heating  sdh  and the  s solar heating and cooling  shc  program 
the obstacles preventing the large scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology  and the cost  currently  photovoltaic  pv  panels only have the ability to convert around 16  of the sunlight that hits them into electricity 
both
and the
 nrel   have heavily funded solar research programs  the nrel solar program has a budget of around  75 million and develops research projects in the areas of
 pv  technology  solar thermal energy  and solar radiation  the budget for sandias solar division is unknown  however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratorys  2.4 billion budget 
several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years  the solar energy research center  serc  at
 unc  has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology  in 2008  researchers at
 mit  developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water  such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining 
in february 2012  north carolina-based semprius inc   a solar development company backed by german corporation   announced that they had developed the worlds most efficient solar panel  the company claims that the prototype converts 33.9  of the sunlight that hits it to electricity  more than double the previous high-end conversion rate 
wind  
main article 
wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when
developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds  today  both
and
have programs dedicated to wind research  sandias laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials  aerodynamics  and sensors  the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production  reducing their capital costs  and making wind energy more cost effective overall 
the field laboratory for optimized wind energy  flowe  at
was established to research alternative approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost  size  and environmental impact of wind energy production

biomass can be regarded as    derived from living  or recently living organisms  it most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called   as an energy source  biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat  or indirectly after converting it to various forms of   conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into  thermal  chemical  and biochemical methods  wood remains the largest biomass energy source today  examples include forest residues  such as dead trees  branches and    yard clippings  wood chips and even   in the second sense  biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial   including   industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants  including                   and a variety of tree species  ranging from
to
   
biomass  biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat power and in doing so harm the environment  pollutants such as sulphurous oxides  sox   nitrous oxides  nox   and particulate matter  pm  are produced from this combustion  the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution  and biomass combustion is a major contributor of it  the use of biomas is carbon neutral over time  but is otherwise similar to burning fossil fuels

from 1978 to 1996  the
experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the      a self-published article by michael briggs  at the
biofuels group  offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all motor vehicle fuel with biofuels by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50   which briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants    this oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels  with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol 
the production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale  but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate  in addition to its projected high yield  algaculture unlike food crop-based biofuels  does not entail a decrease in food production  since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water  many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes  including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels 
several groups in various sectors are conducting research on jatropha curcas  a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil  much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of jatropha through advancements in genetics  soil science  and horticultural practices    a san diego-based jatropha developer  has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds of jatropha that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties  the center for sustainable energy farming  cfsef  is a los angeles-based non-profit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science  agronomy  and horticulture  successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300  in the next ten years

disadvantages  
further information        and
the generation of alternative energy on the scale needed to replace fossil energy  in an effort to reverse global climate change  is likely to have significant negative environmental impacts  for example 
generation would have to increase 7-fold to supply current primary energy demand  and up to 40-fold by 2100 given economic and energy growth projections  humans already appropriate 30 to 40  of all photosynthetically fixed carbon worldwide  indicating that expansion of additional biomass harvesting is likely to stress ecosystems  in some cases precipitating collapse and extinction of animal species that have been deprived of vital food sources  the total amount of energy capture by vegetation in the united states each year is around 58 quads  61.5 ej   about half of which is already harvested as agricultural crops and forest products  the remaining biomass is needed to maintain ecosystem functions and diversity  since annual energy use in the united states is ca  100 quads  biomass energy could supply only a very small fraction  to supply the current worldwide energy demand solely with biomass would require more than 10  of the earths land surface  which is comparable to the area use for all of world agriculture  i e   ca  1500 million hectares   indicating that further expansion of biomass energy generation will be difficult without precipitating an ethical conflict  given current world hunger statistics  over growing plants for biofuel versus food 
given environmental concerns  e g   fish migration  destruction of sensitive aquatic ecosystems  etc   about building new dams to capture hydroelectric energy  further expansion of conventional
is unlikely  windpower  if deployed on the large scale necessary to substitute fossil energy  is likely to face public resistance  if 100  of u s  energy demand were to be supplied by windmills  about 80 million hectares  i e   more than 40  of all available farmland in the united states  would have to be covered with large windmills  50m hub height and 250 to 500 m apart   it is therefore not surprising that the major
is related to land use and less to wildlife  birds  bats  etc   mortality  unless only a relatively small fraction of electricity is generated by windmills in remote locations  it is unlikely that the public will tolerate large windfarms given concerns about blade noise and aesthetics 
biofuels are different from fossil fuels in regard to net greenhouse gases but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to   burning produces airborne carbon
