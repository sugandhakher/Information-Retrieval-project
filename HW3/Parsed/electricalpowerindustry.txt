in 1882  throughout the 1880s and 1890s  growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the industry  once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas  reliable and economical electric power has become a requirement for normal operation of all elements of developed economies 
by the middle of the 20th century  electric power was seen as a     only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market  in some areas  vertically-integrated companies provides all stages from generation to retail  and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure 
since the 1990s  many regions have opened up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive   while such markets can be abusively
with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers  generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency  however  transmission and distribution are harder problems since

although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an
since
developed the
in 1800  its production by this means was  and still is  expensive  in 1831 
devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion  but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage  in 1878  in the  
developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed
electricity 
the world s first public electricity supply was provided in late 1881  when the streets of the
town of
in the
were lit with electric light  this system was powered from a water wheel on the   which drove a siemens
that supplied a number of
within the town  this supply scheme also provided electricity to a number of shops and premises to light 34 incandescent swan light bulbs 
additionally  robert hammond  in december 1881  demonstrated the new electric light in the
town of
in the uk for a trial period  the ensuing success of this installation enabled hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing  as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light  thus the hammond electricity supply co  was launched  whilst the godalming and holborn viaduct schemes closed after a few years the brighton scheme continued on  and supply was in 1887 made available for 24 hours per day 
in early 1882  edison opened the worlds first steam-powered electricity generating station at
in   where he had entered into an agreement with the city corporation for a period of three months to provide street lighting  in time he had supplied a number of local consumers with electric light  the method of supply was direct current  dc  
it was later on in the year in september 1882 that edison opened the
in
and again it was a dc supply  it was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer s premises as edison had no means of voltage conversion  the voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise  increasing the
reduces the
and therefore reduces the required wire thickness  unfortunately it also increases the
and increases the required
thickness  furthermore  some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages  the overall effect was that edison s system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers  while this could work in city centres  it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power 
the mid to late 1880 s saw the introduction of
 ac  systems in europe and the u s  ac power had an advantage in that   installed at   could be used to raise the voltage from the generators  and transformers at local
could reduce voltage to supply loads  increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses  this made it more economical to distribute power over long distances  generators  such as
sites  could be located far from the loads  ac and dc competed for a while  during a period called the   the dc system was able to claim slightly greater safety  but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out 
high tension line in    
the ac power system used today developed rapidly  backed by industrialists such as
with         john dixon gibbs        and others contributed to this field 
while
 hvdc  is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent
power systems  the bulk of electricity generation  transmission  distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current 
market reform  
there has such as transmission and distribution sectors from the contestable sectors of generation and retailing across the world  this has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in england and wales in 1990  in some countries  wholesale electricity markets operate  with
and
trading electricity in a similar manner to
and   as
continues further  utilities are driven to sell their
as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the
and
and other financial arrangements  even
with foreign purchases are taking place  one such purchase was the when
  the largest private electric utility in the world  bought s electric system for  3.2 billion  domestically  local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation  especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering  technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets  such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in   aeroderivative
used in   solar engineering and
systems  off-shore wind farms  and the communication advances spawned by the digital world  particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching 
electricity is expected to see growing
in the future  the
is highly reliant on electric power  other growth areas include emerging new electricity-exclusive technologies  developments in space conditioning    and
 for example     
organization  
the electric power industry is commonly split up into four processes  these are
such as a    
and   in many countries  electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure  for this reason  electric power is viewed as a   the industry is generally heavily   often with
and is frequently  
the nature and state of market reform of the
often determines whether electric companies are able to be involved in just some of these processes without having to own the entire infrastructure  or citizens choose which components of infrastructure to patronise  in countries where electricity provision is deregulated  end-users of electricity may opt for more costly  
generation

main articles 
and
all forms of electricity generation have positive and negative aspects 
will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms  but in a   the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources  it is not clear yet which form can best meet the necessary energy demands or which process can best solve the demand for electricity  there are indications that
and
are becoming more viable in economic terms  a diverse mix of generation sources reduces the risks of electricity price spikes

the organization of the electrical sector of a country or region varies depending on the economic system of the country  in some places  all electric power generation  transmission and distribution is provided by a government controlled organization  other regions have private or investor-owned utility companies  city or municipally owned companies 
companies owned by their own customers  or combinations  generation  transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company  or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system
