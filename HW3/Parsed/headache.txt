headache is the symptom of
anywhere in the region of the
or   it occurs in     and   frequent headaches can affect relationships and employment  there is also an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches 
headaches can occur as a result of many conditions whether serious or not  there are a number of different classification systems for headaches  the most well-recognized is that of the   causes of headaches may include fatigue  sleep deprivation  stress  the effects of medications  the effects of recreational drugs  viral infections  common colds  head injury  rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage  and dental or sinus issues 
treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause  but commonly involves   some form of headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts 
about half of adults have a headache in a given year  tension headaches are the most common affecting about 1.6billion people  21.8  of the population  followed by migraine headaches which affect about 848 million  11.7

cause  
there are more than 200 types of headaches  some are harmless and some are life-threatening  the description of the headache and findings on   determine whether additional tests are needed and what treatment is best 
primary vs  secondary headaches  
headaches are broadly classified as  primary  or  secondary   primary headaches are benign  recurrent headaches not caused by underlying disease or structural problems  for example 
is a type of primary headache  while primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability  they are not dangerous  secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease  like an      
or   secondary headaches can be harmless or dangerous  certain  red flags  or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous 
primary headaches  
90  of all headaches are primary headaches  primary headaches usually first start when people are between 20 and 40 years old   the most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches  they have different characteristics  migraines typically present with pulsing head pain  nausea  photophobia  sensitivity to light  and phonophobia  sensitivity to sound   tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing  bandlike  pressure on both sides of the head  not accompanied by other symptoms  other very rare types of primary headaches include 
  short episodes  15180 minutes  of severe pain  usually around one eye  with autonomic symptoms  tearing  red eye  nasal congestion  which occur at the same time every day  cluster headaches can be treated with triptans and prevented with prednisone  ergotamine or lithium 
  shooting face pain
  continuous unilateral pain with episodes of severe pain  hemicrania continua can be relieved by the medication indomethacin 
primary stabbing headache  recurrent episodes of stabbing  ice pick pain  or  jabs and jolts  for 1 second to several minutes without autonomic symptoms  tearing  red eye  nasal congestion   these headaches can be treated with  
primary cough headache  starts suddenly and lasts for several minutes after coughing  sneezing or straining  anything that may increase pressure in the head   serious etiologies see secondary headaches red flag section  must be ruled out before a diagnosis of  benign  primary cough headache can be made 
primary exertional headache  throbbing  pulsatile pain which starts during or after exercising  lasting for 5 minutes to 24 hours  the mechanism behind these headaches is unclear  possibly due to straining causing veins in the head to dilate  causing pain  these headaches can be prevented by not exercising too strenuously and can be treated with medications such as  
  dull  bilateral headache that starts during sexual activity and becomes much worse during orgasm  these headaches are thought to be due to lower pressure in the head during sex  it is important to realize that headaches that begin during orgasm may be due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage  so serious causes must be ruled out first  these headaches are treated by advising the person to stop sex if they develop a headache  medications such as
and
can also be helpful 
hypnic headache  moderate-severe headache that starts a few hours after falling asleep and lasts 1530 minutes  the headache may recur several times during night  hypnic headaches are usually in older women  they may be treated with  
secondary headaches  
headaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck  some of these are not harmful  such as
 pain arising from the neck muscles  
may occur in those using excessive painkillers for headaches  paradoxically causing worsening headaches 
more serious causes of secondary headaches include 
  inflammation of the meninges which presents with fever and meningismus  or stiff neck
bleeding inside the brain   
 acute  severe headache  stiff neck without fever 
   
 headache only 
  dull headache  worse with exertion and change in position  accompanied by nausea and vomiting  often  the person will have nausea and vomiting for weeks before the headache starts 
  inflammatory disease of arteries common in the elderly  average age 70  with fever  headache  weight loss  jaw claudication  tender vessels by the temples  polymyalgia rheumatica
 increased pressure in the eyeball   headache that starts with eye pain  blurry vision  associated with nausea and vomiting  on physical exam  the person will have a red eye and a fixed  mid dilated pupil 
post-ictal headaches  headaches that happen after a convulsion or other type of seizure  as part of the period after the seizure  the
state 
pathophysiology  
the
itself is not sensitive to   because it lacks   however  several areas of the
and
do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain  these include the extracranial arteries    large veins    cranial and spinal nerves  head and neck muscles  the     parts of the brainstem  eyes  ears  teeth and lining of the mouth  pial arteries  rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production 
headaches often result from traction to or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels  the nociceptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumors and cause headaches  blood vessel spasms  dilated   inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate nociceptors and cause pain  once stimulated  a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fiber to the nerve cells in the brain  signaling that a part of the body hurts 
primary headaches are more difficult to understand than secondary headaches  the exact mechanisms which cause migraines  tension headaches and cluster headaches are not known  there have been different theories over time which attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these headaches 
migraines are currently thought to be caused by dysfunction of the nerves in the brain  previously  migraines were thought to be caused by a primary problem with the blood vessels in the brain  this vascular theory  which was developed in the 20th century by wolff  suggested that the aura in
is caused by constriction of intracranial vessels  vessels inside the brain   and the headache itself is caused by rebound dilation of extracranial vessels  vessels just outside the brain   dilation of these extracranial blood vessels activates the pain receptors in the surrounding nerves  causing a headache  the vascular theory is no longer accepted  studies have shown migraine head pain is not accompanied by extracranial vasodilation  but rather only has some mild intracranial vasodilation 
currently  most specialists think migraines are due to a primary problem with the nerves in the brain  auras are thought to be caused by a wave of increased activity of neurons in the
 a part of the brain  known as cortical spreading depression followed by a period of depressed activity  some people think headaches are caused by the activation of
which release peptides  such as serotonin  causing inflammation in arteries  dura and meninges and also cause some vasodilation  triptans  medications which treat migraines  block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels 
people who are more susceptible to experience migraines without headache are those who have a family history of migraines  women  and women who are experiencing hormonal changes or are taking
or are prescribed  
are thought to be caused by activation of peripheral nerves in the head and neck muscles
involve overactivation of the
and
in the brain  but the exact cause is unknown

auras
uncommonly 
or noise sensitivity
may be accompanied by     and   often only on one side
sensitivity to movement  light  and noise
exacerbated by regular use of
or
may exist with tension headache
most headaches can be diagnosed by the clinical history alone  if the symptoms described by the person sound dangerous  further testing with neuroimaging and or lumbar puncture may be necessary  electroencephalography  eeg  is not useful for headache diagnosis 
the first step to diagnosing a headache is to determine if the headache is old or new  a  new headache  can be a headache that has started recently  or a chronic headache that has changed character  for example  if a person has chronic weekly headaches with pressure on both sides of his head  and then develops a sudden severe throbbing headache on one side of his head  he has a new headache 
red flags  
it can be challenging to differentiate between low-risk  benign headaches and high-risk  dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar  headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose 
the american college for emergency physicians published criteria for low-risk headaches  they are as follows 
age younger than 30 years
features typical of primary headache
history of similar headache
no abnormal findings on neurologic exam
no concerning change in normal headache pattern
no high-risk comorbid conditions  for example  hiv 
no new concerning history or physical examination findings
a number of characteristics make it more likely that the headache is due to potentially dangerous secondary causes which may be life-threatening or cause long-term damage  these  red flag  symptoms means that a headache warrants further investigation with neuroimaging and lab tests 
in general  people complaining of their  first  or  worst  headache warrant imaging and further workup  people with progressively worsening headache also warrant imaging  as they may have a mass or a bleed that is gradually growing  pressing on surrounding structures and causing worsening pain  people with neurological findings on exam  such as weakness  also need further workup 
the american headache society recommends using  ssnoop   a mnemonic to remember the red flags for identifying a secondary headache 
systemic symptoms  fever or weight loss 
systemic disease  hiv infection  malignancy 
neurologic symptoms or signs
onset sudden  thunderclap headache 
onset after age 40 years
previous headache history  first  worst  or different headache 
other red flag symptoms include 
red flag
possible causes
reason why red flag indicates possible causes
diagnostic tests
new headache after age 50
temporal arteritis  mass in brain
temporal arteritis is an inflammation of vessels close to the temples in older people  which decreases blood flow to the brain and causes pain  may also have tenderness in temples and or jaw claudication  some brain cancers are more common in older people 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate  diagnostic test for temporal arteritis   neuroimaging
very sudden onset headache   
brain bleed    hemorrhage into mass lesion       mass  especially in  
a bleed in the brain irritates the meninges which causes pain  pituitary apoplexy  bleeding or impaired blood supply to the pituitary gland at the base of the brain  is often accompanied by double vision or visual field defects  since the pituitary gland is right next to the
 eye nerves  
 
if computed tomography is negative
headaches increasing in frequency and severity
mass  subdural hematoma  medication overuse
as a brain mass gets larger  or a
 blood outside the vessels underneath the   it pushes more on surrounding structures causing pain  medication overuse headaches worsen with more medication taken over time 
neuroimaging  drug screen
new onset headache in a person with possible hiv or cancer
 chronic or carcinomatous  
including  
people with hiv or cancer are immunosuppressed so are likely to get infections of the meninges or infections in the brain causing abscesses  cancer can metastasize  or travel through the blood or lymph to other sites in the body 
neuroimaging  lumbar puncture if neuroimaging is negative
headache with signs of total body illness  fever  stiff neck  rash 
 
 inflammation of the brain tissue    
a stiff neck  or inability to flex the neck due to pain  indicates inflammation of the meninges  other signs of systemic illness indicates infection 
neuroimaging  lumbar puncture  serology  diagnostic blood tests for infections 
brain mass 
 pseudotumor cerebri  
increased intracranial pressure pushes on the eyes  from inside the brain  and causes papilledema 
neuroimaging  lumbar puncture
severe headache following head trauma
brain bleeds         post-traumatic headache
trauma can cause bleeding in the brain or shake the nerves  causing a post-traumatic headache
neuroimaging of brain  skull  and possibly cervical spine
inability to move a limb
arteriovenous malformation  collagen vascular disease  intracranial mass lesion
focal neurological signs indicate something is pushing against nerves in the brain responsible for one part of the body
neuroimaging  blood tests for collagen vascular diseases
change in personality  consciousness  or mental status
    mass
change in mental status indicates a global infection or inflammation of the brain  or a large bleed compressing the brainstem where the consciousness centers lie
blood tests  lumbar puncture  neuroimaging
headache triggered by cough  exertion or while engaged in sexual intercourse
mass lesion  subarachnoid hemorrhage
coughing and exertion increases the intra cranial pressure  which may cause a vessel to burst  causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage  a mass lesion already increases intracranial pressure  so an additional increase in intracranial pressure from coughing etc  will cause pain 
neuroimaging  lumbar puncture
old headaches  
old headaches are usually primary headaches and are not dangerous  they are most often caused by
or   migraines are often unilateral  pulsing headaches accompanied by nausea and or vomiting  there may be an aura  visual symptoms  numbness or tingling  3060 minutes before the headache  warning the person of a headache  migraines may also not have auras  tension type headaches usually have bilateral  bandlike  pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting  however  some symptoms from both headache groups may overlap  it is important to distinguish between the two because the treatments are different 
the mnemonic  pound  helps distinguish between migraines and tension type headaches  pound stands for pulsatile quality  472 hours in length  unilateral location  nausea or vomiting  disabling intensity  one review article found that if 45 of the pound characteristics are present  migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than tension type headache   24   if 3 characteristics of pound are present  migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache   3   if only 2 pound characteristics are present  tension type headaches are 60  more likely  likelihood ratio 0.41   another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension type headache  nausea  photophobia  phonophobia  exacerbation by physical activity  unilateral  throbbing quality  chocolate as headache trigger  cheese as headache trigger 
are relatively rare  13 in 10,000 people  and are more common in men than women  they present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms  tearing  runny nose and red eye  
 chronic pain in the jaw joint   and
 headache caused by pain in muscles of the neck  are also possible diagnoses 
for chronic  unexplained headaches  keeping a headache diary can be useful for tracking symptoms and identifying triggers  such as association with menstrual cycle  exercise and food  the national migraine center has free headache diaries to download at their website  while mobile electronic diaries for smartphones are becoming increasingly common  a recent review found most are developed with a lack of evidence base and scientific expertise 
new headaches  
new headaches are more likely to be dangerous   they can  however  simply be the first presentation of a chronic headache syndrome  like migraine or tension-type headaches 
one recommended diagnostic approach is as follows  if any urgent
are present such as visual loss  new seizures  new weakness  new confusion  further workup with imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture should be done  see red flags section for more details   if the headache is sudden onset  thunderclap headache   a computed tomography test to look for a brain bleed    should be done  if the ct scan does not show a bleed  a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the csf  as the ct scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal  if there are signs of infection such as fever  rash  or stiff neck  a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered  if there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person  a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started 
neuroimaging  
old headaches  
the us headache consortium has guidelines for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches  most old  chronic headaches do not require neuroimaging  if a person has the characteristic symptoms of a migraine  neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the person has an intracranial abnormality  if the person has neurological findings  such as weakness  on exam  neuroimaging may be considered 
new headaches  
all people who present with
indicating a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging  the best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial  non-contrast computerized tomography  ct  scan is usually the first step in head imaging as it is readily available in emergency departments and hospitals and is cheaper than mri  non-contrast ct is best for identifying an acute head bleed  magnetic resonance imaging  mri  is best for brain tumors and   or back of the brain  mri is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems  however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person s headaches 
the american college of radiology recommends the following imaging tests for different specific situations 
clinical features
recommended neuroimaging test
headache in immunocompromised people  cancer  hiv 
of head with or without contrast
headache in people older than 60 with suspected temporal arteritis
mri of head with or without contrast
headache with suspected meningitis
ct or mri without contrast
severe headache in pregnancy
ct or mri without contrast
severe unilateral headache caused by possible dissection of carotid and or arterial arteries
mri of head with or without contrast 
or
of head and neck 
sudden onset headache or worst headache of life
ct of head without contrast 
of head and neck with contrast 
of head and neck with and without contrast  mri of head without contrast
lumbar puncture  
a
is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid is removed from the spine with a needle  a lumbar puncture is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid  a lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column  which can be useful for people with
 usually young  obese women who have increased intracranial pressure   or other causes of increased intracranial pressure  in most cases  a ct scan should be done first 
classification  
headaches are most thoroughly classified by the  s international classification of headache disorders  ichd   which published the second edition in 2004  the third edition of the international headache classification was published in 2013 in a beta version ahead of the final version  this classification is accepted by the  
other classification systems exist  one of the first published attempts was in 1951  the us
developed a classification system in 1962 
ichd-2  
main article 
the
 ichd  is an in-depth
classification of headaches published by the   it contains explicit  operational 
for headache disorders  the first version of the classification  ichd-1  was published in 1988  the current revision  ichd-2  was published in 2004 
the classification uses numeric codes  the top  one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups  the first four of these are classified as primary headaches  groups 5-12 as secondary headaches 
  central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups 
the ichd-2 classification defines   tension-types headaches  cluster headache and other
autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches  also  according to the same classification  stabbing headaches and headaches due to   exertion and sexual activity    are classified as primary headaches  the daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well 
secondary headaches are classified based on their etiology and not on their   according to the ichd-2 classification  the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as     post
or other head or neck injury  headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as
and   non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage 
or
are also defined as secondary headaches  this type of headaches may also be caused by
or different intracranial vascular disorders  other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure  non-infectious inflammatory disease  intracranial neoplasm 
or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the   ichd-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well  this type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances     intracranial
and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches  the ichd-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches  this means that headaches caused by       and cephalalgia and even
are considered secondary headaches  secondary headaches  according to the same classification system  can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including   jaws  or   headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as
or
are also classified as secondary headaches 
the ichd-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of
in a different category  according to this system  there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain  moreover  the ichd-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified 
although the ichd-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches  primarily primary headaches   it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner 
nih  
main article 
the nih classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches 
the nih system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches  in this case  primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural   according to this classification  headaches can only be vascular    cervicogenic  traction and inflammatory 
management  
an old advertisement for a headache medicine 
see also 
primary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments  in those with chronic headaches the long term use of opioids appears to result in greater harm than benefit 
migraines  
can be somewhat improved by lifestyle changes  but most people require medicines to control their symptoms  medications are either to prevent getting migraines  or to reduce symptoms once a migraine starts 
preventive medications are generally recommended when people have more than four attacks of migraine per month  headaches last longer than 12 hours or the headaches are very disabling  possible therapies include beta blockers  antidepressants  anticonvulsants and nsaids  the type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has  for example  if the person also has depression  an antidepressant is a good choice 
abortive therapies for migraines may be oral  if the migraine is mild to moderate  or may require stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly  mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with nsaids  like ibuprofen  and or acetaminophen  if accompanied by nausea or vomiting  an antiemitic such as metoclopramide  reglan  can be given orally or rectally  moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral   a medication which mimics serotonin  an agonist  and causes mild vasoconstriction  if accompanied by nausea and vomiting  parenteral  through a needle in the skin  triptans and antiemetics can be given 
several complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines  the american academy of neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated   electromyographic feedback and
may be considered for migraine treatment  along with medications 
tension-type headaches  
can usually be managed with
 ibuprofen  naproxen  
or  
are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines  for chronic tension type headaches 
is the only medication proven to help  amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain  it works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine  and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism  studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed  overall  they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches 
cluster headaches  
abortive therapy for cluster headaches includes subcutaneous sumatriptan  injected under the skin  and triptan nasal sprays  high flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief 
for people with extended periods of cluster headaches  preventive therapy can be necessary  verapamil is recommended as first line treatment  lithium can also be useful  for people with shorter bouts  a short course of prednisone  10 days  can be helpful  ergotamine is useful if given 12 hours before an attack  see
for more detailed information 
secondary headaches  
treatment of secondary headaches involves treating the underlying cause  for example  a person with meningitis will require antibiotics  a person with a
may require surgery 
and or brain radiation 
neuromodulation  
peripheral neuromodulation has tentative benefits in primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine  how it may work is still being looked into 
epidemiology  
approximately 6477  of people have a headache at some point in their lives  during each year  on average  4653  of people have headaches  most of these headaches are not dangerous  only approximately 15  of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause 
more than 90  of headaches are primary headaches  most of these primary headaches are tension headaches  most people with tension headaches have  episodic  tension headaches that come and go  only 3.3  of adults have chronic tension headaches  with headaches for more than 15 days in a month 
approximately 1218  of people in the world have migraines  more women than men experience migraines  in europe and north america  59  of men experience migraines  while 1225  of women experience migraines 
cluster headaches are very rare  they affect only 13 per thousand people in the world  cluster headaches affect approximately three times as many men as women 
history  
an 1819 caricature by
depicting a headache 
the first recorded classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by   in de cephalalgia in 1672  in 1787
generally divided headaches into
 primary headaches  and
 secondary ones   and defined 84 categories 
another name for headache is  cephalalgia   which is a historic term   
children  
in general  children suffer from the same types of headaches as adults do  but their symptoms may be slightly different  the diagnostic approach to headache in children is similar to that of adults  however  young children may not be able to verbalize pain well  if a young child is fussy  they may have a headache 
approximately 1  of emergency department visits for children are for headache  most of these headaches are not dangerous  the most common type of headache seen in pediatric emergency rooms is headache caused by a cold  28.5    other headaches diagnosed in the emergency department include post-traumatic headache  20    headache related to a problem with a
 a device put into the brain to remove excess
and reduce pressure in the brain   11.5   and migraine  8.5    the most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds         meningitis and
malfunction  only 46.9  of kids with a headache have a serious cause 
just as in adults  most headaches are benign  but when head pain is accompanied with other symptoms such as     and   a more serious underlying cause may exist                or   in these cases  the headache evaluation may include ct scan or mri in order to look for possible structural disorders of the   if a child with a recurrent headache has a normal physical exam  neuroimaging is not recommended  guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams  confusion  seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life  change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging 
when children complain of headaches  many parents are concerned about a   generally  headaches caused by brain masses are incapacitating and accompanied by vomiting  one study found characteristics associated with brain tumor in children are  headache for greater than 6 months  headache related to sleep  vomiting  confusion  no visual symptoms  no family history of migraine and abnormal  
some measures can help prevent headaches in children  drinking plenty of water throughout the day  avoiding caffeine  getting enough and regular sleep  eating balanced meals at the proper times  and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches  treatments for children are similar to those for adults  however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children 
children who have headaches will not necessarily have headaches as adults  in one study of 100 children with headache  eight years later 44  of those with tension headache and 28  of those with migraines were headache free  in another study of people with chronic daily headache  75  did not have chronic daily headaches two years later  and 88  did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later
