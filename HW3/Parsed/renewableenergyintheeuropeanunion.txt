share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption in eu-28 countries in 2014  in   
the trends of various sources used for gross electricity production in europe between 1990 and 2013  measured in gwh 
the
set an objective of promoting stable growth while protecting the environment  the
added the principle of sustainable development to the objectives of the eu  since 1997  the eu has been working towards a renewable energy supply equivalent to 12  of the total eu s energy consumption by 2010 
the
failed to introduce the radical changes targeted for ten years after the   no specific goals were set for the energy sector  which disappointed many countries  while the eu had proposed an annual increase in the use of renewable energy at a rate of 1.5  worldwide until 2010  johannesburg s action plan did not recommend such a  substantial  increase  with no concrete goals nor dates being set 
the eu was unwilling to accept this result and with other nations formed a group of  pioneer countries  that promised to establish ambitious national or even regional goals to achieve global targets  the johannesburg renewable energy coalition  jrec  has a total of more than 80 member countries  the eu members  brazil  south africa and new zealand amongst them 
in the european conference for renewable energy in berlin in 2004  the eu defined ambitious goals of its own  the conclusion was that by 2020  the eu would seek to obtain 20  of its total energy consumption requirements with renewable energy sources  up until that point  the eu had only set targets up to 2010  and this proposal was the first to represent the eu s commitment up to 2020 
renewable energy targets  
in 2009 the
set binding targets for all eu member states  such that the eu will reach a 20  share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and a 10  share of renewable energy specifically in the transport sector  by 2014 the eu realized a 16  share of energy from renewable sources with nine member states already achieving its goals 
in 2014  negotiations about eu energy and climate targets until 2030 are set to start  central and eastern european member states are likely to attempt to slow down the transformation process 
the key parts of the european renewable energy targets agreement set in 2014 are as proposed by a shell lobbyist in october 2011  shell is the sixth biggest lobbyist in brussels  spending between 4.25-4.5m a year lobbying the eu institutions  agreement has no binding targets for member states on energy efficiency or renewable energy 
links to climate policy  
underlying many of the eu s energy policy proposals is the goal to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2c above pre-industrial levels  of which 0.8c has already taken place and another 0.50.7c  for total warming of 1.3-1.5c  is already   2c is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid  dangerous    however some scientists  such as   professor of energy and climate change in the school of mechanical  aeronautical and civil engineering at the university of manchester and former director of the   the uk s leading academic climate change research organisation  have argued that to be consistent with the science  1c is a more accurate threshold for  dangerous  climate change

required member states to submit
by 30 june 2010  these plans  to be prepared in accordance with the template published by the commission  provide detailed roadmaps of how each member state expects to reach its legally binding 2020 target for the share of renewable energy in their final energy consumption  member states must set out the sectoral targets  the technology mix they expect to use  the trajectory they will follow and the measures and reforms they will undertake to overcome the barriers to developing renewable energy  the plans are published by the ec upon receipt in the original language  allowing public scrutiny  the commission will evaluate them  assessing their completeness and credibility  in parallel  the plans will be translated into english  in addition  the energy research centre of the netherlands was contracted by the european environment agency to create an external database and quantitative report of the reports received so far 
the member states which joined the eu in 2004 must apply the provisions of directive 2001/77 ec on producing electricity from renewable energy sources  their accession treaty sets national indicative targets for the proportion of electricity produced from res  res-e  in each new member state the result of which is an overall objective of 21  for the eu-25 
the member states must adopt and publish  initially every five years  a report setting the indicative member state targets for future res-e consumption for the following ten years and showing what measures have or are to be taken to meet those targets  the member state targets must take account of the reference values set out in the annex to the directive for member states  indicative targets concerning the share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption in 2010  they must also be compatible with all the national commitments entered into as part of the commitments accepted by the community in kyoto

italy  
main article 
in 2014  38.2  of italian electric energy consumption came from renewable sources  in 2005 this value was 15.4    covering 16.2  of the total energy consumption of the country  5.3  in 2005  
production accounted for almost 9  of the total electric consumption in the country in 2014  making italy the country with the highest contribution from solar energy in the world 
lithuania  
main article 
the majority of renewable energy in
is from firewood  the principal source of electricity from renewable resources is from hydropower 
lithuania has many yet undeveloped renewable energy sources  such as wind  solar  geothermal energy  municipal waste  and biomass  the amount of biomass per capita in lithuania is one of the highest in the european union and it is estimated that in 2020 lithuania will be the first in the eu according to the quantity of available biomass for biofuel production  the projected production of biofuels by 2020 is 0.25 tons per capita 
portugal  
main article 
in 2010  more than 50  of all yearly electricity consumption in portugal was generated from renewable energy sources  the most important generation sources were hydroelectric  30   and wind power  18    with bioenergy  5   and photovoltaic solar power  0,5   accounting for the rest  in 2001  the portuguese government launched a new
instrument  the e4 programme  energy efficiency and endogenous energies   consisting of a set of multiple  diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent  integrated approach to energy supply and demand  by promoting energy efficiency and the use of endogenous  renewable  energy sources  the programme seeks to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the countrys social fabric  while simultaneously preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions  especially the co2 responsible for climatic change  as a result  in the five years between 2005 and 2010  energy production from renewable sources increased 28  
in january 2014  91  of the monthly needed portuguese electricity consumption was generated by renewable sources  although the real figure stands at 78   as 14  was exported

spain  
main article 
spain as a whole has the target of generating 30  of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2010  with half of that amount coming from wind power  in 2006  20  of the total electricity demand was already produced with renewable energy sources  and in january 2009 the total electricity demand produced with renewable energy sources reached 34.8  
some
lead europe in the use of
technology and plan to reach 100  renewable energy generation in few years 
and   in particular  are near this goal  in 2006 they fulfilled about 70  of their total electricity demand from renewable energy sources 
if
is also considered co2 free  two autonomous communities in spain have already managed to fulfill their total 2006 electricity demand  free  of co2 emissions 
and  
in 2005 spain became the first country in the world to require the installation of
electricity generation in new buildings  and the second in the world  after   to require the installation of

description  wind turbines are used to generated electricity  research from a wide variety of sources in various european countries shows that support for wind power is consistently about 80 per cent amongst the general public 
wind power installed in europe in 2013
2011 installed wind power capacity in the european union totalled 93,957
 mw  - enough to supply 6.3  of the eu s electricity  9,616 mw of
was installed in 2011 alone  representing 21.4  of new power capacity  the eu wind industry has had an average annual growth of 15.6  over the last 17 years  1995-2011  
2009 a
report  entitled europe s onshore and offshore wind energy potential confirms wind energy could power europe many times over  the report highlights wind powers potential in 2020 as three times greater than europes expected electricity demand  rising to a factor of seven by 2030  an ewea report overviewing 2009 data estimated that 230
 gw  of wind capacity will be installed in europe by 2020  consisting of 190 gw onshore and 40 gw offshore  this would produce 14-17  of the eu s electricity  avoiding 333 million tonnes of co2 per year and saving europe 28 billion a year in avoided fuel costs

2012 17.2 gw of pv capacity were connected to the grid in europe   compared to 22.4 gw in 2011  europe still accounted for the predominant share of the global pv market  with 55  of all new capacity in 2012 
2004 79  of all european capacity was in germany  where 794 mwp had been installed  the
anticipated that germany may have installed around 4,500 mwp by 2010 
2002  the world production of photovoltaic modules surpassed 550 mw  of which more than the 50  was produced in the eu  within 15 years even a small country in europe might expect to exceed this amount in domestic installations 
concentrated solar power  
description  csv power can generate either heat or electrictiy according to the type used  one advantage of
 csp  is the ability to include
to provide power up to 24 hours a day 
2015 the first commercial application of a a new form of csp called stem will take place in sicily   this has generated considerable academic and commercial interest internationally for off-grid applications to produce 24 hour industrial scale power for mining sites and remote communities in italy  other parts of europe  australia  asia  north africa and latin america  stem uses fluidized silica sand as a thermal storage and heat transfer medium for csp systems  it has been developed by salerno-based magaldi industries 
2012 by year end in the european union  2,114 mwp had been installed  mainly in spain    in spain  was the first to provide 24hour power

2010 if all eu countries used solar thermal as enthusiastically as the   the eus installed capacity would already be 91 gwth  130million m2 today  far beyond the target of 100million m2 by 2010  set by the
in 1997  
2008 the research efforts and infrastructure needed to supply 50  of the energy for space and water
across europe using solar thermal energy was set out under the aegis of the
 esttp   published in late december 2008  more than 100 experts developed the
 sra   which includes a deployment roadmap showing the non-technological framework conditions that will enable this ambitious goal to be reached by 2050 
2007 s minimum target is to produce solar heating equivalent to 5.600.000 tons of oil  by 2020   a more ambitious  but feasible  target is 73 million tons of oil per year  by 2020 
2005 worldwide usage was 88 gwthermal   growth potential is enormous solar heating in the eu was equivalent to more than 686.000 tons of oil
