bioethanol is a form of quasi- that can be produced from agricultural   it can be made from very common
such as      
and   there has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol is in replacing gasoline  concerns about its production and use relate to
due to the large amount of arable land required for crops  as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production  especially from corn  recent developments with
may allay some of these concerns 
offers promise because cellulose fibers  a major and universal component in plant cells walls  can be used to produce ethanol  according to the   cellulosic ethanol could allow ethanol fuels to play a much bigger role in the future

about 5  of the ethanol produced in the world in 2003 was actually a petroleum product  it is made by the catalytic hydration of ethylene with
as the   it can also be obtained via
or   from     oil gas  and other sources  two million short tons  1,786,000 long tons  1,814,000t  of petroleum-derived ethanol are produced annually  the principal suppliers are plants in the united states  europe  and south africa  petroleum derived ethanol  synthetic ethanol  is chemically identical to bio-ethanol and can be differentiated only by radiocarbon dating 
bio-ethanol is usually obtained from the conversion of carbon-based   agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable because they get energy from the sun using photosynthesis  provided that all minerals required for growth  such as nitrogen and phosphorus  are returned to the land  ethanol can be produced from a variety of feedstocks such as           grain                                  other   as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting  whichever has the best
assessment 
an alternative process to produce bio-ethanol from algae is being developed by the company   rather than grow
and then harvest and ferment it  the algae grow in sunlight and produce ethanol directly  which is removed without killing the algae  it is claimed the process can produce 6,000 u s  gallons per acre  5,000 imperial gallons per acre  56,000 liters per hectare  per year compared with 400 us gallons per acre  330impgal acre  3,700l ha  for corn production 
currently  the first generation processes for the production of ethanol from corn use only a small part of the corn plant  the corn kernels are taken from the corn plant and only the starch  which represents about 50  of the dry kernel mass  is transformed into ethanol  two types of second generation processes are under development  the first type uses
and
to convert the plant cellulose into ethanol while the second type uses
to convert the whole plant to either a liquid
or a   second generation processes can also be used with plants such as grasses  wood or agricultural waste material such as straw 
production  
the basic steps for large-scale production of ethanol are  microbial   
of sugars   
 requirements vary  see ethanol fuel mixtures  below   and
 optional   prior to fermentation  some crops require
or
of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch into sugars  saccharification of cellulose is called
 see    enzymes are used to convert starch into sugar 
fermentation  
main article 
ethanol is produced by
of the sugar  microbial fermentation currently only works directly with   two major components of plants 
and cellulose  are both made of sugarsand can  in principle  be converted to sugars for fermentation  currently  only the sugar  e g   sugar cane  and starch  e g   corn  portions can be economically converted  there is much activity in the area of cellulosic ethanol  where the cellulose part of a plant is broken down to sugars and subsequently converted to ethanol 
distillation  
ethanol plant in west
ethanol plant in sertozinho  brazil 
for the ethanol to be usable as a fuel  the majority of the water must be removed  most of the water is removed by   but the purity is limited to 9596  due to the formation of a low-boiling water-ethanol
with maximum  95.6  m m  96.5  v v  ethanol and 4.4  m m  3.5  v v  water   this mixture is called hydrous ethanol and can be used as a fuel alone  but unlike
ethanol  hydrous ethanol is not miscible in all ratios with gasoline  so the water fraction is typically removed in further treatment to burn in combination with gasoline in gasoline engines 
dehydration  
there are basically three dehydration processes to remove the water from an
ethanol water mixture  the first process  used in many early fuel ethanol plants  is called
and consists of adding
or
to the mixture  when these components are added to the mixture  it forms a heterogeneous azeotropic mixture in   which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom  and a vapor mixture of water  ethanol  and cyclohexane benzene 
when condensed  this becomes a two-phase liquid mixture  the heavier phase  poor in the entrainer  benzene or cyclohexane   is stripped of the entrainer and recycled to the feedwhile the lighter phase  with condensate from the stripping  is recycled to the second column  another early method  called   consists of adding a ternary component that increases ethanol s relative volatility  when the ternary mixture is distilled  it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column 
with increasing attention being paid to saving energy  many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration  of these methods  a third method has emerged and has been adopted by the majority of modern ethanol plants  this new process uses
to remove water from fuel ethanol  in this process  ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads  the bead s pores are sized to allow absorption of water while excluding ethanol  after a period of time  the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere  e g  n2  to remove the absorbed water  two beds are often used so that one is available to absorb water while the other is being regenerated  this dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus gallon  840 k l  compared to earlier azeotropic distillation 
post-production water issues  
ethanol is   meaning it absorbs water vapor directly from the atmosphere  because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends  which causes engine stall   containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed  this high
with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern   like liquid hydrocarbons  over long distances 
the fraction of water that an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without phase separation increases with the percentage of ethanol  this shows  for example  that e30 can have up to about 2  water  if there is more than about 71  ethanol  the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and phase separation does not occur  the fuel mileage declines with increased water content  the increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits e30 and hydrated ethanol to be put in the same tank since any combination of them always results in a single phase  somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures  for e10 it is about 0.5  v v at 70 f and decreases to about 0.23  v v at 30 f 
consumer production systems  
while
production systems have been marketed to home and business users for many years  commercialized ethanol production systems designed for end-consumer use have lagged in the marketplace  in 2008  two different companies announced home-scale ethanol production systems  the afs125 advanced fuel system from allard research and development is capable of producing both ethanol and biodiesel in one machine  while the e-100 microfueler from e-fuel corporation is dedicated to ethanol only 
engines  
fuel economy  
ethanol contains approx  34  less energy per unit volume than gasoline  and therefore in theory  burning pure ethanol in a vehicle reduces miles per us gallon 34   given the same   compared to burning pure gasoline  however  since ethanol has a higher octane rating  the engine can be made more efficient by raising its compression ratio  using a variable   the compression ratio can be optimized for the fuel  making fuel economy almost constant for any blend 
for e10  10  ethanol and 90  gasoline   the effect is small   3   when compared to conventional gasoline  and even smaller  12   when compared to oxygenated and reformulated blends  for e85  85  ethanol   the effect becomes significant  e85 produces lower mileage than gasoline  and requires more frequent refueling  actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle  based on epa tests for all 2006 e85 models  the average fuel economy for e85 vehicles resulted 25.56  lower than unleaded gasoline  the epa-rated mileage of current united states flex-fuel vehicles should be considered when making price comparisons  but e85 is a high performance fuel  with an octane rating of about 9496  and should be compared to premium 
cold start during the winter

flex-fuel has outside direct access to the secondary reservoir gasoline tank in the front right side  the corresponding fuel filler door is shown by the arrow 
high
present a problem to achieve enough
for the fuel to evaporate and spark the ignition during cold weather  since ethanol tends to increase fuel    when vapor pressure is below 45
starting a cold engine becomes difficult  to avoid this problem at temperatures below 11  52   and to reduce ethanol higher emissions during cold weather  both the us and the european markets adopted e85 as the maximum blend to be used in their flexible fuel vehicles  and they are optimized to run at such a blend  at places with harsh cold weather  the ethanol blend in the us has a seasonal reduction to
for these very cold regions  though it is still sold as e85  at places where temperatures fall below 12  10  during the winter  it is recommended to install an engine heater system  both for gasoline and e85 vehicles  sweden has a similar seasonal reduction  but the ethanol content in the blend is reduced to
during the winter months 
brazilian flex fuel vehicles can operate with ethanol mixtures up to   which is
ethanol  with up to 4  water   which causes vapor pressure to drop faster as compared to e85 vehicles  as a result  brazilian flex vehicles are built with a small secondary gasoline reservoir located near the engine  during a cold start pure gasoline is injected to avoid starting problems at low temperatures  this provision is particularly necessary for users of brazil s southern and central regions  where temperatures normally drop below 15  59  during the winter  an improved flex engine generation was launched in 2009 that eliminates the need for the secondary gas storage tank  in march 2009
launched the   the first brazilian flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start

in many countries cars are mandated to run on mixtures of ethanol  all brazilian light-duty vehicles are built to operate for an ethanol blend of up to 25      and since 1993 a federal law requires mixtures between 22  and 25  ethanol  with 25  required as of mid july 2011  in the united states all light-duty vehicles are built to operate normally with an ethanol blend of 10      at the end of 2010 over 90 percent of all gasoline sold in the u s  was blended with ethanol  in january 2011 the
 epa  issued a waiver to authorize up to 15  of ethanol blended with gasoline    to be sold only for cars and light pickup trucks with a
of 2001 or newer 
beginning with the model year 1999  an increasing number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0  ethanol up to 100  ethanol without modification  many cars and
 a class containing  
and   are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85     in north america and europe  and up to 100   e100  in brazil  in older model years  their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve
 no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust  air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix  in newer models  the alcohol sensors have been removed  with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content  the engine control computer can also adjust  advance  the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned  this method is backed up by advanced knock sensors  used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not  that detect pre-ignition and detonation 
other engine configurations  
ed95 engines
since 1989 there have also been ethanol engines based on the diesel principle operating in sweden  they are used primarily in city buses  but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors  the engines  made by   have a modified compression ratio  and the fuel  known as ed95  used is a mix of 93.6  ethanol and 3.6  ignition improver  and 2.8    the ignition improver makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel combustion cycle  it is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol  these engines have been used in the united kingdom by
but the use of bioethanol fuel is now being phased out 
dual-fuel direct-injection
a 2004
study and an earlier paper published by the society of automotive engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline  the method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric  the improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol  or the azeotrope or e85  and gasoline  in any ratio up to 100  of either  in a turbocharged  high compression-ratio  small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement  each fuel is carried separately  with a much smaller tank for alcohol  the high-compression  for higher efficiency  engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions  alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders  and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced  only when necessary to suppress knock such as when significantly accelerating  direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130  the calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and co2 emission is 30   the consumer cost payback time shows a 4 1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5 1 improvement over hybrid  the problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline  causing phase separation   supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided 
increased thermal efficiency
in a 2008 study  complex engine controls and increased exhaust gas recirculation allowed a compression ratio of 19.5 with fuels ranging from neat ethanol to e50  thermal efficiency up to approximately that for a diesel was achieved  this would result in the
of a neat ethanol vehicle to be about the same as one burning gasoline 
fuel cells powered by an ethanol reformer
in june 2016 
announced plans to develop
powered by ethanol rather than   the fuel of choice by the other car manufacturers that have developed and commercialized fuel cell vehicles  such as the     and   the main advantage of this technical approach is that it would be cheaper and easier to deploy the fueling infrastructure than setting up the one required to deliver hydrogen at high pressures  as each hydrogen fueling station cost us 1 million to us 2 million to build 
nissan plans to create a technology that uses liquid ethanol fuel as a source to generate hydrogen within the vehicle itself  the technology uses heat to reform ethanol into hydrogen to feed what is known as a solid oxide fuel cell  sofc   the fuel cell generates electricity to supply power to the electric motor driving the wheels  through a battery that handles peak power demands and stores regenerated energy  the vehicle would include a tank for a blend of water and ethanol  which is fed into an onboard reformer that splits it into pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide  according to nissan  the liquid fuel could be an ethanol-water blend at a 55 45 ratio  nissan expects to commercialize its technology by 2020

all biomass goes through at least some of these steps  it needs to be grown  collected  dried  fermented  distilled  and burned  all of these steps require resources and an infrastructure  the total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance  or      figures compiled in a 2007 by
point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the us  one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol  the energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in brazil is more favorable  with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol  energy balance estimates are not easily produced  thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory  for instance  a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane  which requires a tropical climate to grow productively  returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended  as compared to corn  which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended  a 2006 university of california berkeley study  after analyzing six separate studies  concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline 
  a   is emitted during fermentation and combustion  this is canceled out by the greater uptake of carbon dioxide by the plants as they grow to produce the biomass  when compared to gasoline  depending on the production method  ethanol releases less greenhouse gases 
air pollution  
compared with conventional   ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide  water and   the
requires the addition of
to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the united states  the additive
is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination  hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive  current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient
such as ammonia 
a study by atmospheric scientists at stanford university found that e85 fuel would increase the risk of air pollution deaths relative to gasoline by 9  in los angeles  us  a very large  urban  car-based metropolis that is a worst-case scenario 
levels are significantly increased  thereby increasing photochemical smog and aggravating medical problems such as asthma 
brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel  gas
studies were performed of ambient air in so paulo  brazil  and compared to osaka  japan  which does not burn ethanol fuel  atmospheric formaldehyde was 160  higher in brazil  and acetaldehyde was 260  higher   
carbon dioxide  
uk government calculation of
of corn bioethanol grown in the us and burnt in the uk 
graph of uk figures for the
of bioethanol and   this graph assumes that all bioethanols are burnt in their country of origin and that previously existing cropland is used to grow the feedstock 
see also 
the calculation of exactly how much carbon dioxide is produced in the manufacture of bioethanol is a complex and inexact process  and is highly dependent on the method by which the ethanol is produced and the assumptions made in the calculation  a calculation should include 
the cost of growing the feedstock
the cost of transporting the feedstock to the factory
the cost of processing the feedstock into bioethanol
such a calculation may or may not consider the following effects 
the cost of the change in land use of the area where the fuel feedstock is grown 
the cost of transportation of the bioethanol from the factory to its point of use
the efficiency of the bioethanol compared with standard gasoline
the amount of carbon dioxide produced at the tail pipe 
the benefits due to the production of useful bi-products  such as
or electricity 
the graph on the right shows figures calculated by the uk government for the purposes of the  
the january 2006 science article from uc berkeley s erg  estimated reduction from corn ethanol in ghg to be 13  after reviewing a large number of studies  in a correction to that article released shortly after publication  they reduce the estimated value to 7.4   a
overview article  2007  puts the figures at 22  less co2 emissions in production and use for corn ethanol compared to gasoline and a 56  reduction for cane ethanol  carmaker ford reports a 70  reduction in co2 emissions with bioethanol compared to petrol for one of their flexible-fuel vehicles 
an additional complication is that production requires tilling new soil which produces a one-off release of ghg that it can take decades or centuries of production reductions in ghg emissions to equalize  as an example  converting grass lands to corn production for ethanol takes about a century of annual savings to make up for the ghg released from the initial tilling 
change in land use

large-scale farming is necessary to produce agricultural alcohol and this requires substantial amounts of cultivated land  university of minnesota researchers report that if all corn grown in the u s  were used to make ethanol it would displace 12  of current u s  gasoline consumption  there are claims that land for ethanol production is acquired through deforestation  while others have observed that areas currently supporting forests are usually not suitable for growing crops  in any case  farming may involve a decline in soil fertility due to reduction of organic matter  a decrease in water availability and quality  an increase in the use of pesticides and fertilizers  and potential dislocation of local communities  new technology enables farmers and processors to increasingly produce the same output using less inputs 
cellulosic ethanol production is a new approach that may alleviate land use and related concerns  cellulosic ethanol can be produced from any plant material  potentially doubling yields  in an effort to minimize conflict between food needs vs  fuel needs  instead of utilizing only the starch by-products from grinding wheat and other crops  cellulosic ethanol production maximizes the use of all plant materials  including gluten  this approach would have a smaller
because the amount of energy-intensive fertilisers and fungicides remain the same for higher output of usable material  the technology for producing cellulosic ethanol is currently in the  
using biomass for electricity instead of ethanol  
converting biomass to electricity for charging electric vehicles may be a more  climate-friendly  transportation option than using biomass to produce ethanol fuel  according to an analysis published in science in may 2009 researchers continue to search for more cost-effective developments in both cellulosic ethanol and advanced vehicle batteries 
health costs of ethanol emissions  
for each billion ethanol-equivalent gallons of fuel produced and combusted in the us  the combined climate-change and health costs are  469 million for gasoline   472952 million for corn ethanol depending on biorefinery heat source  natural gas  corn stover  or coal  and technology  but only  123208 million for cellulosic ethanol depending on feedstock  prairie biomass  miscanthus  corn stover  or switchgrass  
efficiency of common crops  
as ethanol yields improve or different feedstocks are introduced  ethanol production may become more economically feasible in the us  currently  research on improving ethanol yields from each unit of corn is underway using biotechnology  also  as long as oil prices remain high  the economical use of other feedstocks  such as   become viable  by-products such as straw or wood chips can be converted to ethanol  fast growing species like
can be grown on land not suitable for other cash crops and yield high levels of ethanol per unit area

one rationale given for extensive ethanol production in the u s  is its benefit to   by shifting the need for some foreign-produced oil to domestically produced energy sources  production of ethanol requires significant energy  but current u s  production derives most of that energy from coal  natural gas and other sources  rather than oil  because 66  of oil consumed in the u s  is imported  compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16  of natural gas  figures from 2006   the displacement of oil-based fuels to ethanol produces a net shift from foreign to domestic u s  energy sources 
according to a 2008 analysis by iowa state university  the growth in us ethanol production has caused retail gasoline prices to be us  0.29 to us  0.40 per gallon lower than would otherwise have been the case 
motorsport  
qualified third for the
auto race with an ethanol-fueled car  the
adopted a 10  ethanol blend for the 2006 season  and a 98  blend in 2007 
in drag racing  there are
classes for
and
since the 1970s 
the
sports car championship introduced e10 in the 2007 season to replace pure gasoline  in the 2008 season  e85 was allowed in the gt class and teams began switching to it 
in 2011  the three national
stock car series mandated a switch from gasoline to e15  a blend of sunoco gtx unleaded racing fuel and 15  ethanol 
australia s
championship uses united e85 for its racing fuel

ethanol fuel may also be utilized as a   as of 2010  small quantities of ethanol are used in
 
replacement cooking fuel  
is a u s   
organization involved in the creation of a commercially viable household market for alcohol-based fuels in ethiopia and other countries in the   the project considers alcohol fuels to be a solution to fuel shortages  environmental damage  and public health issues caused by traditional cooking in the developing world  targeting poor and marginalized communities that face health issues from cooking over polluting fires  gaia currently works in         and   and is in the planning stage of projects in several other countries 
research  
ethanol plant in  
ethanol research focuses on alternative sources  novel catalysts and production processes 
in 2013 
began initial operation of a bio-ethanol plant from vegetative material and wood waste 
the

genes and
can produce ethanol from  
an alternative technology allows for the production of
from grain that has already been used to produce ethanol 
another approach uses feed stocks such as municipal waste  recycled products   
  wood chips or  
in 2016  researchers from the oak ridge national laboratory used a nanotechnology-based catalyst to convert a solution of carbon dioxide dissolved in water into ethanol
