the     and
are three renewable energy sources
greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy is a 2007 book by australian academic   the book puts forward a set of policies and strategies for implementing the most promising
technologies by all spheres of government  business and community organisations  greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy suggests that a mix of  
sources and
 as a transitional fuel  offers a clean and feasible energy future for australia 
contents
structure and themes  
the book is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems and is structured in three sections 
introduction to the basic concepts and latest scientific evidence regarding global warming 
assessment of energy technologies  including coal  nuclear and more sustainable alternatives 
discussion of policies and strategies needed to overcome the non-technical barriers to renewable energies and energy efficiency 
diesendorf argues that 
ecologically sustainable energy technologies based on energy efficiency  renewable energy and natural gas are commercially available today  and that their implementation could halve australias
within a few decades 
to implement these technologies  new policies must be developed and implemented by all three levels of government 
the main barriers are neither technical nor economic  but rather our social institutions and the political power of the big greenhouse gas emitting industries  coal  oil  aluminium  cement and motor vehicles 
wind power variability  
early in his career  mark diesendorf was a principal research scientist with
where he was involved in early research on integrating
into electricity grids  this issue is discussed in some detail in greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy 
diesendorf explains that large-scale wind power is not  intermittent   because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously  in practice  the variations in thousands of wind turbines  spread out over several different sites and wind regimes  are smoothed  as the distance between sites increases  the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites  decreases  this has been confirmed recently by studies conducted by
from  
 graham sinden  analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the united kingdom  he found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 at 200 km to 0.25 at 600 km separation  a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.0   there were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the united kingdom  and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the united kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year 
diesendorf goes on to say that every conventional power station breaks down unexpectedly from time to time  causing an immediate loss of all its power  that is true intermittency  according to diesendorf  and it is a particular type of variability that switches between full power and no power  once a conventional power station has broken down  it may be offline for weeks  much longer than windless periods 
quotes  
 the enhanced greenhouse effect is arguably the most dangerous environmental problem and the most difficult political issue to be faced by the world in the 21st century    p 1 
 the recent push for a revival of nuclear energy has been based on its claimed reduction in co2 emissions where it substitutes for coal-fired power stations  in reality  only reactor operation is co2-free  all other stages of the nuclear fuel chain -- mining  milling  fuel fabrication  enrichment  reactor construction  decommissioning  and waste management -- use fossil fuels and hence emit co2      p 252 
 global wind-power capacity continues to expand and  apart from the blip in 2006  its costs continue to decline steadily  wind power is one of the few energy supply technologies that are ready for wide dissemination today  unlike coal with co2 capture and sequestration and unlike nuclear power  wind can deliver deep cuts in co2  while providing a hedge against fluctuating fossil fuel prices and reducing energy import dependence    p 126 
critical reception  
dick nichols  in green left  states that greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy brings together much useful material about global warming and possible solutions 
diesendorf s book concentrates into one volume a succinct analysis of global warming  a rebuttal of climate change scepticism  a thorough summary of the state of development of each renewable energy technology  a masterly demolition of false solutions to greenhouse  like
and nuclear power  and a presentation of strategies and policies for uprooting carbon-intensive power production in australia  add in chapters on saving energy and transport and urban redesign and greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy illuminates the reader about all the main features of the many-sided debate on how to make sustainable energy production the heart of the attack on climate change 
nichols suggests that if theres one serious shortcoming in greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy its  a failure to consistently trace what rate of implementation of energy efficiency and uptake of renewable energy sources is necessary to confront the greenhouse emergency  
patrick o neill  in chain reaction  suggests that greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems  and that the book is  simply a joy to read   o neill explains that whilst an immense amount of technical and scientific detail is presented  the language is simple and the book is well laid out  it also covers often ignored areas of the sustainable energy discussion such as population issues  morality  social justice and equity  in conclusion  o neill states that the book is a  wonderfully energising piece of sedition   which calls for a  coordinated national strategy for non-violent action  
george wilkenfield  in australian review of public affairs  is more critical and suggests the book feels  strangely anachronistic   partly because it treats climate change as an issue that can be resolved through grassroots activism or by the opposition of protest movements to unjust regimes  wilkenfield explains that  this rather misses the point that the continuing rise in global greenhouse gas emissions is not a byproduct of injustice or repression but of economic freedom in the west and the unrelenting economic growth by which repressive regimes such as chinas buy legitimacy  in general  very few people want to be freed from consumptionmost want the freedom to consume even more   wilkenfield goes on to say that diesendorf misses some of the dynamics of consumption  energy use gives people comfort  speed  privacy and convenience  many people actually enjoy driving and like their cars  and would continue to use them as long as they could afford to  even if public transport were available 
nevertheless  in the end  wilkenfield concedes that greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy is very suitable as a textbook  or as a handbook for activists  journalists or the more committed reader who is not afraid of numbers
