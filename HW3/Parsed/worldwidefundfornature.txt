the conservation foundation  
the conservation foundation  a precursor to wwf  was founded in 1947 by
in new york city in support of capitalism-friendly ecological practices  the advisory council included leading scientists such as         and   it supported much of the scientific work cited by  s   including that of       and  
in 1963  the foundation held a conference and published a major report warning of
  written by
based on the work of foundation vice-president             and  
in 1990  the conservation foundation was merged into wwf  after becoming an affiliate of wwf in 1985  when it became a distinct legal entity but with the same staff and board  the organization now known as the conservation foundation in the united states is the former  
morges manifesto  
the idea for a fund on behalf of endangered animals was initially proposed by
to sir
in response to articles he published in the british newspaper   this proposal led huxley to put stolan in contact with   a person who had had thirty years experience of linking
intellectuals with
interests through the
  nicholson thought up the name of the organization  wwf was conceived on 29 april 1961  under the name of world wildlife fund  and its first office was opened on 11 september that same year in   switzerland  wwf was conceived to act as a funding institution for existing conservations groups such as the
and the conservation foundation 
also played an important role in its creation  assembling the first staff  its establishment marked with the signing of the  morges manifesto   the founding document that sets out the fund s ideology 
the wwf hot air balloon in brazil
   they need above all money  to carry out missions and to meet conservation emergencies by buying land where wildlife treasures are threatened  money  for example  to pay guardians of wildlife refuges    for educations among those who would care    for sending experts to danger spots and training    making it all possible that their needs are met before it is too late 
morges manifesto
later history  
wwf has set up offices and operations around the world  it originally worked by fundraising and providing grants to existing non-governmental organizations  based on the best-available scientific knowledge and with an initial focus on the protection of   as more resources became available  its operations expanded into other areas such as the preservation of   sustainable use of   the reduction of   and   the organization also began to run its own conservation projects and campaigns  and by the 1980s started to take a more strategic approach to its conservation activities 
in 1986  the organization changed its name to world wide fund for nature  while retaining the wwf initials  however  it continued at that time to operate under the original name in the united states and canada 
that year was the 25th anniversary of wwf s foundation  an event marked by a gathering in assisi  italy to which the organization s international president hrh prince philip  the duke of edinburgh  invited religious authorities representing buddhism  christianity  hinduism  islam and judaism  these leaders produced the assisi declarations  theological statements showing the spiritual relationship between their followers and nature that triggered a growth in the engagement of those religions with conservation around the world 
in the 1990s  wwf revised its mission statement to 
stop the degradation of the planet s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature  by 
conserving the world s biological diversity 
ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable   and 
promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption 
wwf scientists and many others identified 238
that represent the world s most biologically outstanding  
and
habitats  based on a worldwide biodiversity analysis which the organization says was the first of its kind  in the early 2000s  decade   its work was focused on a subset of these ecoregions  in the areas of forest  freshwater and marine   endangered species conservation  climate change  and the elimination of the most toxic chemicals 
 we shan t save all we should like to  but we shall save a great deal more than if we had never tried   sir
in 1996  the organization obtained general
from  
panda symbol  
the giant panda has become the symbol of wwf 
wwf s
logo originated from a panda named
that had been transferred from
to
in 1958  three years before wwf became established  the logo was founded by young and was founded in 1966  being famous as the only panda residing in the western world at that time  its uniquely recognisable physical features and status as an endangered species were seen as ideal to serve the organization s need for a strong recognisable symbol that would overcome all language barriers  moreover  the organization also needed an animal that would have an impact in black and white printing  the logo was then designed by
from preliminary sketches made by gerald watterson  a scottish naturalist  however the logo shown on this page is not the logo designed by peter scott but a later one  designed for wwf when it changed its name from world wildlife fund to world wide fund for nature   
21st century  
wwf s strategy for achieving its mission specifically focuses on restoring populations of 36
 species or species groups that are important for their
or to people  including        and
in 6 areas  carbon emissions  cropland  grazing land  fishing  forestry and water    
the organization also works on a number of global issues driving biodiversity loss and unsustainable use of natural resources  including finance  business practices  laws  and consumption choices  local offices also work on national or regional issues 
wwf works with a large number of different groups to achieve its goals  including other ngos  governments  business  investment banks  scientists  fishermen  farmers and local communities  it also undertakes public campaigns to influence decision makers  and seeks to educate people on how to live in a more environmentally friendly manner it urges people to donate funds to protect the environment  the donors can also choose to receive gifts in return   
publications  
wwf publishes the
in collaboration with the   along with
calculations  the index is used to produce a bi-yearly
giving an overview of the impact of human activity on the world 
the organization also regularly publishes reports  fact sheets and other documents on issues related to its work  in order to raise awareness and provide information to policy and decision makers 
policy-making  
policies of the wwf are made by the board members who are elected for three- year terms  the executive team guides and develops wwf s strategy  there is also a national council which stands as an advisory group to the board and finally a team of scientists and experts in conservation who research for wwf 
national and international law plays an important role in determining how habitats and resources are managed and used  laws and regulations become one of the organizations global priorities 
the wwf has been opposed to the extraction of oil from the canadian
and has campaigned on this matter  between 2008 and 2010 the wwf worked with   the  s largest
to publish reports which concluded that   1  exploiting the canadian tar sands to their full potential would be sufficient to bring about what they described as  runaway climate change   2  carbon capture and storage  ccs  technology cannot be used to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a level comparable to that of other methods of oil extraction   3  the  379 billion which is expected to be spent extracting oil from
could be better spent on research and development in renewable energy technology  and  4  the expansion of tar sands extraction poses a serious threat to the caribou in alberta  
the organization convinces and helps governments and other political bodies to adopt  enforce  strengthen and or change policies  guidelines and laws that affect biodiversity and natural resource use  it also ensures the governments to consent and or keeps their commitment to international instruments relating to the protection of biodiversity and natural resources 
in 2012  david nussbaum  chief executive of wwf-uk  spoke out against the way
is used in the uk  saying      the government must reaffirm its commitment to tackling climate change and prioritise renewables and energy efficiency  
controversies  
corporate partnerships  
wwf has been accused by the campaigner
of being too close to businesses to campaign objectively  wwf claims partnering with corporations such as      s and
will reduce their effect on the environment  wwf received 56 million  us 80 million  from corporations in 2010  an 8  increase in support from corporations compared to 2009   accounting for 11  of total revenue for the year 
project  lock   
in 1988  prince bernhard  previously wwf s first president  sold paintings for 700,000 to raise money for the world wildlife fund  the money was deposited in a swiss wwf bank account  in 1989  charles de haes  then wwf director-general  transferred gbp500,000 back to bernhard for what he  de haes  called a  private project   it was then revealed  in 1991  that prince bernhard had used the money to hire kas international  owned by
founder   for an operation called project  lock  during which
 mostly british  fought
in nature reserves 
mekong river dolphins report  
in june 2009  touch seang tana  chairman of  s commission for conservation and development of the
dolphins eco-tourism zone  charged that the wwf had misrepresented the danger of extinction of the
in order to boost fundraising  the report stated that the deaths were caused by a bacterial disease that became fatal due to environmental contaminants suppressing the dolphins  immune systems  he called the report unscientific and harmful to the cambodian government and threatened the wwf s cambodian branch with suspension unless they met with him to discuss his claims  touch seang tana later said he would not press charges of supplying false information and would not make any attempt to prevent wwf from continuing its work in cambodia  but advised wwf to adequately explain its findings and check with the commission before publishing another report  after this  in january 2012  touch seang tana signed the  kratie declaration on the conservation of the mekong river irrawaddy dolphin  along with wwf and the cambodian fisheries administration  an agreement binding the parties to work together on a  roadmap  addressing dolphin conservation in the mekong river 
pandaleaks  
in 2012  german investigative journalist wilfried huissmann published a book called  the silence of the pandas   it became a bestseller in germany  but was banned from britain until 2014  when it was released under the title of  pandaleaks   after a series of injunctions and court orders  the book criticizes wwf for its supposed involvement with corporations that are responsible for large-scale destruction of the environment  such as   and gives details into the existence of the secret   whose members  huismann claims  continue to have an unhealthy influence on wwf s policy making  however  wwf has sought to deny the allegations made against it 
ard documentary  
this section s factual accuracy is   please help to ensure that disputed statements are   see the relevant discussion on the    july 2011    
the german public television
aired a documentary on 22 june 2011 that claimed to show how the wwf cooperates with corporations such as   providing sustainability certification in exchange for donations essentially   wwf has denied the allegations  by encouraging high-impact eco-tourism  the program alleges that wwf contributes to the destruction of habitat and species it claims to protect  wwf-india is not active at the tiger reserve given as the example    but it is active elsewhere seeking to limit adverse tourism effects and better sharing of tourism benefits to local communities  the program also alleges wwf certified a palm oil plantation operated by   a singaporean company  on the indonesian island of   even though the establishment of the plantation led to the destruction of over 14,000 hectares of rainforest  only 80 hectares were ultimately conserved  the ard documentary claims  according to the programme  two orangutans live on the conserved land  but have very slim chances of survival because no fruit trees remain and the habitat is too small to sustain them  to survive  they steal palm nuts from the neighbouring plantation  thereby risking being shot by plantation workers  wwf notes that the plantation filmed is pt rimba harapan sakti  which has not been certified as a sustainable producer by the   aerial photographs show that around 4000 hectares  or about a third of the forest cover  has been conserved   
hunting  
the president of honor of wwf in spain used to be   who has been a known hunting enthusiast  in 1962  when he was 24 years old  he was invited by the german baron werner
to a hunt in   since then  the king has taken part in hunting forays in
and   in october 2004  he was a member of a hunt in
that killed a
and nine   including one that was pregnant  according to the romanian newspaper   he was also accused by a russian official of killing a bear called mitrofan  supposedly after giving vodka to the animal  in an episode that sparked controversy in spain  although the claim was never proven  in the same year  according to   the polish government allowed him to kill a
in   even though it is an   further controversy arose in april 2012 when the king s participation in an elephant hunt in
was discovered only after he returned to spain on an emergency flight after tripping over a step and fracturing his hip  many spanish environmental groups and
parties criticized the monarch s hobby  and the wwf stripped him of the honorary position in july 2012  in an extraordinary assembly by 94  of the votes of the members 
  the uk head of the wwf  has stated that he enjoys hunting  he is believed  however  to adhere to legal british traditional hunting and speaks out against hunting endangered species   
alleged human-rights abuses  
in a 2016 complaint to the
 oecd   the nonprofit group
accused wwf of inadvertently facilitating serious human-rights abuses against indigenous
inhabitants of the
in   the complaint alleged that  anti-poaching eco-guards who were part-funded and logistically helped by wwf  victimised the hunter gatherer   razed to the ground their camps  destroyed or confiscated their property  forced them to relocate and have regularly used physical force and threats of violence against them   it was the first such complaint to be made against a conservation group  the complaint alleges that wwf violated oecd guidelines for the conduct of
and the un   wwf responded saying that eco-guards were for the most part  protecting the integrity and resources of a  forest  zoning system that includes community forests  hunting and access zones vital to baka communities   the group disclaimed knowledge of any direct involvement by its staff in rights abuses 
survival international has also accused wwf of violating its own policies regarding indigenous people s rights by forming a partnership with french logging company rougier  which it says is responsible for large areas of deforestation in southeast cameroon  illegally and without the consent of local baka tribespeople  wwf france stated in 2015 that it had entered a  three-year strategic collaboration  with the rougier group
