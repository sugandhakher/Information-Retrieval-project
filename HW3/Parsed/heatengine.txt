in   a heat engine is a system that converts heat or and to   which can then be used to do   it does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature  a heat  source  generates thermal energy that brings the working substance to the high temperature state  the working substance generates work in the    of the engine while
to the colder    until it reaches a low temperature state  during this process some of the thermal energy is converted into
by exploiting the properties of the working substance  the working substance can be any system with a non-zero   but it usually is a gas or liquid  during this process  a lot of heat is lost to the surroundings  i e  it cannot be used 
in general an
converts energy to mechanical   heat engines distinguish themselves from other types of engines by the fact that their efficiency is fundamentally limited by   although this efficiency limitation can be a drawback  an advantage of heat engines is that most forms of energy can be easily converted to heat by processes like
 such as combustion  
of light or energetic particles   
and   since the heat source that supplies thermal energy to the engine can thus be powered by virtually any kind of energy  heat engines are very versatile and have a wide range of applicability 
heat engines are often confused with the cycles they attempt to implement  typically  the term  engine  is used for a physical device and  cycle  for the model

overview  
figure 1  heat engine diagram
in   heat engines are often modeled using a standard engineering model such as the   the theoretical model can be refined and augmented with actual data from an operating engine  using tools such as an   since very few actual implementations of heat engines exactly match their underlying thermodynamic cycles  one could say that a thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of a mechanical engine  in any case  fully understanding an engine and its efficiency requires gaining a good understanding of the  possibly simplified or idealized  theoretical model  the practical nuances of an actual mechanical engine  and the discrepancies between the two 
in general terms  the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink  the larger is the potential
of the cycle  on earth  the cold side of any heat engine is limited to being close to the ambient temperature of the environment  or not much lower than 300   so most efforts to improve the thermodynamic efficiencies of various heat engines focus on increasing the temperature of the source  within material limits  the maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine  which no engine ever attains  is equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends divided by the temperature at the hot end  all expressed in
or kelvins 
the efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today has a large range 
3 percent  97 percent waste heat using low quality heat  for the
ocean power proposal 
25 percent for most automotive gasoline engines
49 percent for a
such as the   and many others
60 percent for a steam-cooled
 
all these processes gain their efficiency  or lack thereof  from the temperature drop across them  significant energy may be used for auxiliary equipment  such as pumps  which effectively reduces efficiency 
power  
heat engines can be characterized by their   which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of
 in the u s  also
per cubic inch   the result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine  this is not to be confused with   since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio  and thus lower power density  a modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of 75kw l  1.65hp in3  
everyday examples  
examples of everyday heat engines include the
 for example most of the world s power plants use steam turbines  a modern form of steam engine   and the  
the   in an automobile or truck  a common toy that is also a heat engine is a   also the
is a heat engine  all of these familiar heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases  the general surroundings are the heat sink  which provides relatively cool gases that  when heated  expand rapidly to drive the mechanical motion of the engine 
examples of heat engines  
it is important to note that although some cycles have a typical combustion location  internal or external   they often can be implemented with the other  for example 
developed an external heated engine running on a cycle very much like the earlier   in addition  externally heated engines can often be implemented in open or closed cycles 
earth s heat engine  
earth s atmosphere and hydrosphereearths heat engineare coupled processes that constantly even out solar heating imbalances through evaporation of surface water  convection  rainfall  winds  and ocean circulation  when distributing heat around the globe 
the hadley system provides an example of a heat engine  the hadley circulation is identified with rising of warm and moist air in the equatorial region with descent of colder air in the subtropics corresponding to a thermally driven direct circulation  with consequent net production of kinetic energy 
phase-change cycles  
in these cycles and engines  the working fluids are gases and liquids  the engine converts the working fluid from a gas to a liquid  from liquid to gas  or both  generating work from the fluid expansion or compression

mesoscopic heat engines  
mesoscopic heat engines are nanoscale devices that may serve the goal of processing heat fluxes and perform useful work at small scales  potential applications include e g  electric cooling devices  in such mesoscopic heat engines  work per cycle of operation fluctuates due to thermal noise  there is exact equality that relates average of exponents of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath  this relation transforms the carnot s inequality into exact equality

in other words  a heat engine absorbs heat energy from the high temperature heat source  converting part of it to useful work and delivering the rest to the cold temperature heat sink

in the case of an engine  one desires to extract work and puts in a heat transfer

the theoretical maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between  this efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the   although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency  mathematically  this is because in

the reasoning behind this being the maximal efficiency goes as follows  it is first assumed that if a more efficient heat engine than a carnot engine is possible  then it could be driven in reverse as a heat pump  mathematical analysis can be used to show that this assumed combination would result in a net decrease in   since  by the   this is statistically improbable to the point of exclusion  the carnot efficiency is a theoretical upper bound on the reliable efficiency of any process 
empirically  no heat engine has ever been shown to run at a greater efficiency than a carnot cycle heat engine 
figure 2 and figure 3 show variations on carnot cycle efficiency  figure 2 indicates how efficiency changes with an increase in the heat addition temperature for a constant compressor inlet temperature  figure 3 indicates how the efficiency changes with an increase in the heat rejection temperature for a constant turbine inlet temperature

figure 3  carnot cycle efficiency with changing heat rejection temperature 
endoreversible heat engines  
the most carnot efficiency as a criterion of heat engine performance is the fact that by its nature  any maximally efficient carnot cycle must operate at an infinitesimal temperature gradient  this is because any transfer of heat between two bodies at differing temperatures is irreversible  and therefore the carnot efficiency expression only applies in the infinitesimal limit  the major problem with that is that the object of most heat engines is to output some sort of power  and infinitesimal power is usually not what is being sought 
a different measure of ideal heat engine efficiency is given by considerations of   where the cycle is identical to the carnot cycle except in that the two processes of heat transfer are not reversible  callen 1985

heat engines have been known since antiquity but were only made into useful devices at the time of the industrial revolution in the 18th century  they continue to be developed today 
heat engine enhancements  
engineers have studied the various heat engine cycles extensively in effort to improve the amount of usable work they could extract from a given power source  the carnot cycle limit cannot be reached with any gas-based cycle  but engineers have worked out at least two ways to possibly go around that limit  and one way to get better efficiency without bending any rules 
increase the temperature difference in the heat engine  the simplest way to do this is to increase the hot side temperature  which is the approach used in modern combined-cycle   unfortunately  physical limits  such as the melting point of the materials used to build the engine  and environmental concerns regarding
production restrict the maximum temperature on workable heat engines  modern gas turbines run at temperatures as high as possible within the range of temperatures necessary to maintain acceptable nox output    another way of increasing efficiency is to lower the output temperature  one new method of doing so is to use mixed chemical working fluids  and then exploit the changing behavior of the mixtures  one of the most famous is the so-called   which uses a 70/30 mix of
and water as its working fluid  this mixture allows the cycle to generate useful power at considerably lower temperatures than most other processes 
exploit the physical properties of the working fluid  the most common such exploitation is the use of water above the so-called critical point  or so-called supercritical steam  the behavior of fluids above their critical point changes radically  and with materials such as water and
it is possible to exploit those changes in behavior to extract greater thermodynamic efficiency from the heat engine  even if it is using a fairly conventional brayton or rankine cycle  a newer and very promising material for such applications is  
and
have also been considered for such applications  although so2 is toxic 
exploit the chemical properties of the working fluid  a fairly new and novel exploit is to use exotic working fluids with advantageous chemical properties  one such is
 no2   a toxic component of smog  which has a natural
as di-nitrogen tetraoxide  n2o4   at low temperature  the n2o4 is compressed and then heated  the increasing temperature causes each n2o4 to break apart into two no2 molecules  this lowers the molecular weight of the working fluid  which drastically increases the efficiency of the cycle  once the no2 has expanded through the turbine  it is cooled by the   which makes it recombine into n2o4  this is then fed back by the compressor for another cycle  such species as
 al2br6   nocl  and ga2i6 have all been investigated for such uses  to date  their drawbacks have not warranted their use  despite the efficiency gains that can be realized
