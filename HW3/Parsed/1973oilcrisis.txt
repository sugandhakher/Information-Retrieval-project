to nearly  12 globally  us prices were significantly higher  the embargo caused an oil crisis  or  shock   with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy  it was later called the  first oil shock   followed by the   termed the  second oil shock

summary  
the embargo was a response to american involvement in the 1973   six days after
and
launched a surprise military campaign against   the us supplied israel with arms  in response to this  the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries  oapec  consisting of the
members of
plus egypt and syria  announced an oil embargo against     the   the
and the  
the crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within   some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from
to avoid being targeted by the boycott  arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents  to address this  the
began multilateral negotiations with the combatants  they arranged for israel to pull back from the
and the   by january 18  1974 
had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula  the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march 1974

mechanism for
to stabilize their incomes by raising world oil prices after the recent failure of negotiations with western oil companies 
the embargo occurred at a time of rising petroleum consumption by industrialized countries and coincided with a sharp increase in oil imports by the world s largest oil consumer  the united states  in the aftermath  targeted countries initiated a wide variety of policies to contain their future dependency 
the 1973  oil price shock   with the accompanying   were regarded as the first discrete event since the
to have a persistent effect on the us economy 
the embargo s success demonstrated  s diplomatic and economic power  it was the largest oil exporter and a politically and religiously conservative kingdom 
background  
us oil production decline  
in 1970  us oil production started to decline  exacerbating the embargo s impact  following this  nixon named
as us ambassador to saudi arabia to audit us production capacity  the confidential results were alarmingno spare capacity was available and production could only decrease 
usa oil production and imports  as shown  the import spike starts from the us production peak  and the embargo has little effect 
the oil embargo had little effect on overall supply  according to akins 
opec  
the
 opec   which then comprised 12 countries  including   seven
countries         
and the    plus    
and   was formed at a
conference on september 14  1960  opec was organized to resist pressure by the     seven large  western oil companies  to reduce  
at first  opec operated as an informal bargaining unit for resource-rich
countries  opec confined its activities to gaining a larger share of the profits generated by oil companies and greater control over member production levels  in the early 1970s it began to exert economic and political strength  the oil companies and importing nations suddenly faced a unified exporter bloc 
end of the bretton woods currency accord  
on august 15  1971  the united states unilaterally
of the   the us abandoned the
whereby the value of the
had been
to the
and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar  whose value was left to  float   rise and fall according to market demand   shortly thereafter  britain followed  floating the   the other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies  anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time  the industrialized nations increased their reserves  by expanding their   in amounts far greater than before  the result was a
of thedollar and other industrialized nations  currencies  because oil was priced in dollars  oil producers  real income decreased  in september 1971  opec issued a joint communiqu stating that  from then on  they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold 
this contributed to the  oil shock   after 1971  opec was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation  from 1947 to 1967  the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year  until the oil shock  the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities  opec ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions  so their
lagged  the substantial price increases of 19731974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold 
yom kippur war  
on october 6  1973  syria and egypt  with support from other arab nations  launched a
on israel  on yom kippur  this renewal of hostilities in the
released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices  at the time  iran was the world s second-largest oil exporter and a close us ally  weeks later  the
said in an interview   of course  the price of oil  is going to rise    certainly  and how     you ve  western nations  increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent  and the same for sugar and cement    you buy our crude oil and sell it back to us  refined as   at a hundred times the price you ve paid us    it s only fair that  from now on  you should pay more for oil  let s say ten times more

authorized   a

embargo  
in response to american aid to israel  on october 16  1973  opec raised the posted price of oil by 70   to  5.11 a barrel  the following day  oil ministers agreed to the embargo  a cut in production by five percent from september s output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met  on october 19  nixon requested congress to appropriate  2.2billion in emergency aid to israel  including  1.5billion in outright grants 
notes   military supplies did not exhaust nixon s eagerness to prevent israel s collapse   this   2.2billion  decision triggered a collective opec response   libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the united states  saudi arabia and the other arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on october 20  1973  at their kuwait meeting  oapec proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the us as a  principal hostile country  
price increases were also imposed greatly  since short-term oil
is   immediate demand falls little when the price rises  thus  market prices rose from  3 per barrel to  12 per barrel to reduce demand to the new  lower level of supply  the world financial system  which was already under pressure from the bretton woods breakdown  was set on a path of recessions and inflation that persisted until the early 1980s  with oil prices remaining elevated until 1986 
the price of oil during the embargo  the graph is based on the   price of oil  and so overstates prices at the end  however  the effects of the arab oil embargo are clearit effectively doubled the real price of crude oil at the refinery level  and caused massive shortages in the u s 
over the long term  the oil embargo changed the nature of policy in the west towards increased exploration  alternative energy research  energy conservation and more restrictive monetary policy to better fight inflation

effects  
immediate economic effects  
a man at a service station reads about the gasoline rationing system in an afternoon newspaper  a sign in the background states that no gasoline is available  1974
the effects of the embargo were immediate  opec forced oil companies to increase payments drastically  the price of oil quadrupled by 1974 to nearly us 12 per
 75 us  m3  
this price increase had a dramatic effect on oil exporting nations  for the countries of the middle east who had long been dominated by the industrial powers seen to have taken control of a vital commodity  the oil-exporting nations began to accumulate vast wealth 
some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities  amid shrinking western demand  much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions  particularly in the middle east  saudi arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of islam  known as   throughout the world  via religious charities such   which often also distributed funds to violent sunni extremist groups such as al-qaeda and the taliban 
control of oil became known as the  oil weapon   it came in the form of an embargo and production cutbacks from the arab states  the weapon was aimed at the united states  great britain  canada  japan and the netherlands  these target governments perceived that the intent was to push them towards a more pro-arab position  production was eventually cut by 25   however  the affected countries did not undertake dramatic policy changes 
in the united states  scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973  the possibility that the middle east could become another superpower confrontation with the ussr was of more concern to the us than oil  further  interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for kissinger s dominance  in the us production  distribution and price disruptions  have been held responsible for recessions  periods of excessive inflation  reduced productivity  and lower economic growth  
the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to u s energy security  on an international level  the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries  such as automobiles  macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts  the embargo left oilcompanies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies  even in rugged terrain such as the arctic  finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to tenyears before significant production 
gas stealers beware  1974
opec-member states raised the prospect of
of oil company holdings  most notably  saudi arabia nationalized
in 1980 under the leadership of saudi oil minister   as other opec nations followed suit  the cartel s income soared  saudi arabia undertook a series of ambitious five-year development plans  the biggest began in 1980  funded at  250billion  other cartel members also undertook major economic development programs 
us retail price gas prices rose from a national average of 38.5cents in may 1973 to 55.1cents in june 1974  state governments requested citizens not to put up  
banned christmas and commercial lighting altogether  politicians called for a national gas rationing program  nixon requested gasoline stations to voluntarily not sell gasoline on saturday nights or sundays  90  of owners complied  which produced long queues 
the embargo was not uniform across europe  of the nine members of the
 eec   the netherlands faced a complete embargo  the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies  having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis   while the other six faced partial cutbacks  the uk had traditionally been an ally of israel  and  s government supported the israelis during the six-day war  his successor    reversed this policy in 1970  calling for israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders 
the eec was unable to achieve a common policy during the first month of the war  it issued a statement on november 6  after the embargo and price rises had begun  it was widely viewed as pro-arab supporting the franco-british line on the war  opec duly lifted its embargo from all eec members  the price rises had a much greater impact in europe than the embargo 
despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo  the uk nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its owna series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 197374 became a major factor in the   heath asked the british to heat only one room in their houses over the winter  the uk  germany  italy  switzerland and norway banned flying  driving and boating on sundays  sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil  the netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity 
a few months later  the crisis eased  the embargo was lifted in march 1974 after negotiations at the washington oil summit  but the effects lingered throughout the 1970s  the dollar price of energy increased again the following year  amid the weakening competitive position of the dollar in world markets 
price controls and rationing  
united states  
exacerbated the crisis in the us  the system limited the price of  old oil   that which had already been discovered  while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment  predictably  old oil was withdrawn from the market  creating greater scarcity  the rule also discouraged development of   the rule had been intended to promote   scarcity was addressed by rationing  as in many countries   motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973 
in 1973  nixon named
as the first administrator of the federal energy office  a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo  simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972  which worked for states whose populations were not increasing  in other states  lines at gasoline stations were common  the
reported that in the last week of february 1974  20  of american gasoline stations had no fuel 
oregon gasoline dealers displayed signs explaining the flag policy in the winter of 197374
allowed vehicles with
having an odd number as the last digit  or a   to buy gas only on odd-numbered days of the month  while others could buy only on even-numbered days 
in some states  a three-color flag system was used to denote gasoline availability at service stationsgreen for unrationed availability  yellow for restricted rationed sales and red for out of stock 
gasoline ration stamps printed by the
in 1974  but not used 
rationing led to violent incidents  when truck drivers chose to strike for two days in december 1973 over the limited supplies simon had allocated for their industry  in
and   non-striking truckers were shot at by striking truckers  and in   trucks of non-strikers were attacked with  
america had controlled the price of natural gas since the 1950s  with the inflation of the 1970s  the price was too low to encourage the search for new reserves  america s natural gas reserves dwindled from 237 trillion in 1974 to 203 trillion   in 1978  the price controls were not changed despite president  s repeated requests to congress 
conservation and reduction in demand  
united states  
to help reduce consumption  in 1974 a
of 55mph  about 88km h  was imposed through the   development of the
began in 1975  and in 1977 the cabinet-level
was created  followed by the
of 1978    on november 28  1995 
signed the   ending the federal 55 mph  89 km h    allowing states to restore their prior maximum speed limit 
year-round
was implemented from january 6  1974  to february 23  1975  the move spawned significant criticism because it forced many children to travel to school before sunrise  the prior rules were restored in 1976   
gas stations abandoned during the crisis were sometimes used for other purposes  this station at   washington was turned into a
hall 
the crisis prompted a call to conserve energy  most notably a campaign by the
using the tagline  don t be fuelish   many newspapers carried advertisements featuring cut-outs that could be attached to light switches  reading  last out  lights out  don t be fuelish    
by 1980  domestic luxury cars with a 130-inch  3.3m 
and gross weights averaging 4,500pounds  2,041kg  were no longer made  the automakers had begun phasing out the traditional front engine  layout in compact cars in favor of lighter front engine  designs  a higher percentage of cars offered more efficient 4-cylinder engines  domestic auto makers also began offering more fuel efficient diesel powered passenger cars as well 
though not regulated by the new legislation  auto racing groups voluntarily began conserving  in 1974  the
was cancelled and
reduced all race distances by 10   the
race was cancelled   
in 1976  congress created the
to help low-income homeowners and renters reduce their demand for heating and cooling through better    
alternative energy sources

the energy crisis led to greater interest in  
and domestic fossil fuels  there is criticism that american energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking  promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities  instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for
and innovation  congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient  but whose prospects are doubtful 
the brazilian government implemented its     pro-alcohol  project in 1975 that mixed

israel was one of the few countries unaffected by the embargo  since it could extract sufficient oil from the sinai  but to supplement  s over-taxed power grid    the father of   developed the prototype for a

macroeconomy  
the crisis was a major factor in shifting japan s economy away from oil-intensive industries  investment shifted to industries such as   japanese auto makers also benefited from the crisis  increased fuel costs allowed their small  fuel-efficient models to gain market share from the  gas-guzzling  american competition  this triggered a drop in american auto sales that lasted into the 1980s 
western
decided to sharply cut
to encourage growth  deciding that inflation was a secondary concern  although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time  the resulting
surprised economists and central bankers  the policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo  recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases 
the price shock created large current account deficits in oil-importing economies  a
mechanism was created  through which opec surplus funds were channeled through the capital markets to the west to finance the current account deficits  the functioning of this mechanism required the relaxation of
in oil-importing economies  it marked the beginning of an exponential growth of western  
many in the public remain suspicious of oil companies  believing they profiteered  or even colluded with opec    in 1974  seven of the fifteen top
companies were oil companies  falling to four in 2014 
international relations  
united states  
america s
policies suffered a major blow from the embargo  they had focused on china and the soviet union  but the latent challenge to us
coming from the third world became evident 
in 2004  declassified documents revealed that the u s  was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize middle eastern oilfields in late 1973  although no explicit plan was mentioned  a conversation between
and
revealed schlesinger had told him that  it was no longer obvious to him that the u s  could not use force  
was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a british intelligence estimate of u s  intentions  which concluded america  might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the u s  and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries   and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in saudi arabia and kuwait  and possibly abu dhabi in military action was decided upon  although the soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force  intelligence warned  the american occupation would need to last 10 years as the west developed alternative energy sources  and would result in the total alienation of the arabs and much of the rest of the third world  
nato  
western europe began switching from pro-israel to more pro-arab policies  this change strained the western alliance  the us  which imported only 12  of its oil from the middle east  compared with 80  for the europeans and over 90  for japan   remained staunchly committed to israel  the percentage of u s oil which comes from the nations bordering the persian gulf remained steady over the decades  with a figure of a little more than 10  in 2008 
with the embargo in place  many developed countries altered their policies regarding the arab-israeli conflict  these included the uk  which refused to allow the united states to use british bases and
to airlift resupplies to israel along with the rest of the members of the  
canada shifted towards a more pro-arab position after displeasure was expressed towards canada s mostly neutral position   on the other hand  after the embargo the canadian government moved quickly indeed toward the arab position  despite its low dependence on middle eastern oil  
japan  
although lacking historical connections to the middle east  japan was the country most dependent on arab oil  71  of its imported oil came from the middle east in 1970  on november 7  1973  the saudi and kuwaiti governments declared japan a  nonfriendly  country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy  it received a 5  production cut in december  causing a panic  on november 22  japan issued a statement  asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories  advocating palestinian self-determination  and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions   by december 25  japan was considered an arab-friendly state 
nonaligned nations  
the oil embargo was announced roughly one month after a
in
led by general
toppled socialist president
on september 11  1973  the response of the nixon administration was to propose doubling arms sales  as a consequence  an opposing latin american bloc was organized and financed in part by venezuelan oil revenues  which quadrupled between 1970 and 1975 
a year after the start of the embargo  the un s nonaligned bloc passed a resolution demanding the creation of a    under which nations within the global south would receive a greater share of benefits derived from the exploitation of southern resources and greater control over their self-development 
arab states  
prior to the embargo  the geo-political competition between the soviet union and the united states  in combination with low oil prices that hindered the necessity and feasibility of alternative energy sources  presented the arab states with financial security  moderate economic growth  and disproportionate international bargaining power 
the oil shock disrupted the status quo relationships between arab countries and the us and ussr  at the time  egypt  syria and iraq were allied with the ussr  while saudi arabia  turkey and iran  plus israel  aligned with the us  vacillations in alignment often resulted in greater support from the respective superpowers 
when
became president of egypt in 1970  he dismissed soviet specialists in egypt and reoriented towards the us  concerns over economic domination from increased soviet oil production turned into fears of military aggression after the   turning the persian gulf states towards the us for security guarantees against soviet military action 
the ussr s invasion of afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region  also marked by increased american weapons sales  technology  and outright military presence  saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats  including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues  both states were competing for preeminence in the
and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries  by 1979  saudi arms purchases from the us exceeded five times israel s  another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the us by saudi arabia was the failure of the shah during january 1979 to maintain control of iran  a non-arabic but largely
muslim nation  which fell to a theocratic islamist government under the
in the wake of the 1979   saudi arabia  on the other hand  is an arab  largely
muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy  in the wake of the iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of   a reality which would quickly be revealed in the
in mecca by
extremists during november 1979 and a shiite revolt in the oil rich
region of saudi arabia in december of the same year  in november 2010  wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the united states and its allies which revealed that the late saudi king abdullah urged the united states to attack iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program  describing iran as  a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination

the oil crisis sent a signal to the auto industry globally  which changed many aspects of production and usage for decades to come 
western europe  
after   most west european countries taxed motor fuel to limit imports  and as a result most cars made in europe were smaller and more economical than their american counterparts  by the late 1960s increasing incomes supported rising car sizes 
the oil crisis pushed west european car buyers away from larger  less economical cars  the most notable result of this transition was the rise in popularity of compact   the only notable small hatchbacks built in western europe before the oil crisis were the  
and   by the end of the decade  the market had expanded with the introduction of the  
 sold as the
in great britain  
and  
buyers looking for larger cars were increasingly drawn to medium-sized hatchbacks  virtually unknown in europe in 1973  by the end of the decade they were gradually replacing
as the mainstay of this sector  between 1973 and 1980  medium-sized hatchbacks were launched across europe  the  
 strada in the uk           and  
these cars were considerably more economical than the traditional
they were replacing  and attracted buyers who traditionally bought larger vehicles  some 15years after the oil crisis  hatchbacks dominated most european small and medium car markets  and had gained a substantial share of the large family car market

fluctuations of opec net oil export revenues since 1972
opec soon lost its preeminent position  and in 1981  its production was surpassed by that of other countries  additionally  its own member nations were divided  saudi arabia  trying to recover market share  increased production  pushing prices down  shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers  the world price  which had peaked during the
at nearly  40 per barrel  decreased during the 1980s to less than  10 per barrel  adjusted for inflation  oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels  this  sale  price was a windfall for oil-importing nations  both developing and developed 
the embargo encouraged new venues for energy exploration including   the   the   and the   exploration in the
and
became profitable  cooperation changed into a far more adversarial relationship as the ussr increased its production  by 1980 the soviet union had become the world s largest producer 
part of the decline in prices and economic and geopolitical power of opec came from the move to alternate energy sources  opec had relied on
to maintain high consumption  but had underestimated the extent to which conservation and other sources of supply would eventually reduce demand 
from
and   home heating from natural gas  and -blended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil 
the drop in prices presented a serious problem for oil-exporting countries in northern europe and the   heavily populated  impoverished countries  whose economies were largely dependent on oilincluding       and did not prepare for a market reversal that left them in sometimes desperate situations 
when reduced demand and increased production glutted the world market in the mid-1980s  oil prices plummeted and the cartel lost its unity  mexico  a non-member   nigeria  and   whose economies had expanded in the 1970s  faced near-bankruptcy  and even saudi arabian economic power was significantly weakened  the divisions within opec made concerted action more difficult  as of 2015  opec had never approached its earlier dominance
