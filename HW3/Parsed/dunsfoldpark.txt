history  
construction and military use  
canadian engineers were charged with the construction of the aerodrome  such projects had previously taken up to a year to complete and this site was complicated by the two hundred acres of woodland that first had to be cleared  the canadian
had access to large-scale earth moving equipment from north america obtained under
arrangements  the canadians also had pipe-pushing apparatus place explosives under trees thereby facilitating their rapid removal  the aerodrome was completed in just six months 
the first squadrons based at the aerodrome were

in 2002
 british aerospace s successor  sold dunsfold aerodrome to the rutland group who formed dunsfold park ltd  today   the
motoring show
is recorded at the park using a hangar as a studio and parts of the runways and taxiways of the aerodrome as  
some of the track is now   used by many driving schools and instructors to enable under 17-year-olds to learn to drive  hundreds of youngsters have now had their first driving experience at the top gear location before going out on to the road   
the track is also used to host cycle races in the summer months as part of a closed circuit series in the surrey cycle racing league 
dunsfold park is also home to   an annual air and motor show that is typically held in late august  the airshow attracted over 25,000 visitors and raised over 80,000 for charities including
and the surrey   sussex air ambulance in 2009  increasing popularity has meant the event is now a two-day show 
dunsfold park ltd also organises a drive-in cinema  dunsfold drive-in   over the easter bank holiday as well as a popular and classical concert  strings   wings  
future  
in 2006  the owners of dunsfold aerodrome proposed the construction of a new settlement with 2,600 homes on the site  a school  health services  public transport and road links to the a281  and an expanded business district  the project was designed to be an exemplar of green and sustainable living 
in late 2007  dunsfold park ltd  applied to have their plans for the new town selected as one of the then
government s proposed eco-towns  on 3 april 2008 dunsfold park was one of over 40 proposals denied eco-town status by the then housing minister   the government s summary assessment said that the bid was too small in terms of house numbers  because the proposal at dunsfold was for only 2,600 houses whereas the minimum size for an eco-town was 5,000  the assessment also said that the public transport offering needed further work 
in may 2008 dunsfold park limited applied to
for planning consent for the eco-settlement  it was opposed by local residents    four borough councils and 13 parish councils as well as the
and the   it received support from
waverley  guildford labour party  farnham labour party  cranleigh labour party and the former lib dem mp for guildford    it also received support from some environmentalists  including leading national authorities on sustainable living such as professor
and from national   for its innovative approach and contribution to sustainable development  friends of the earth also supported the development on the basis that re-development as an eco-settlement would remove the threat of aviation expansion at dunsfold once and for all  however  the proposal was refused planning permission by the local borough council  waverley  and in 2009 rejected on appeal by the then secretary of state  
although the owners say they still hope to persuade the authorities that eco-settlement remains the best long-term future for the site  they say they are now concentrating on expanding and promoting the underlying aviation potential of the aerodrome  which is still in operational use 
dunsfold park s existing lawful use is in part as an aerodrome under a series of temporary planning consents which contain restrictions on the levels of aircraft movement and restrict flying to certain times  however  the long-term and permanent underlying use has been a matter of considerable dispute between the owners and the council  in april 2011  dunsfold park claimed that the use of the site for aviation was entirely unrestricted on the grounds that the use predated the introduction of the planning acts or alternatively that a 60-year-old planning consent dating from 1951 allowed the unrestricted use of the aerodrome for aviation  the claim led to objections from parties such as all the local parish councils and bodies such as the council to protect rural england and friends of the earth  and concern was expressed by local mps 
in june 2011 
refused dunsfold park ltd s application for a certificate of lawful use as an aerodrome  dunsfold appealed but the appeal was rejected in april 2012  when rejecting the appeal the inspector made reference to the old planning consent granted in 1951 for  erection  repair and flight testing of aircraft  stating that it was now agreed by all parties that  it was and is a permanent permission  and that the use at dunsfold will revert to the 1951 consent  in 2018 on expiry of the existing temporary consents  in april 2014    at the   said the 1951 permission for  flight testing  did not amount to consent for unrestricted flying
