populus is a genus of 2535 species of
in the family   native to most of the  
names variously applied to different species include poplar     and  
in the september 2006 issue of   the joint genome institute announced that the western balsam poplar    was the first tree whose full dna code had been determined by  
contents
description  
the genus has a large genetic diversity  and can grow from 1550m  49164ft  tall  with trunks up to 2.5m  8ft 2in  in diameter 
male catkins of
the
on young trees is smooth  white to greenish or dark grey  and often has conspicuous   on old trees  it remains smooth in some species  but becomes rough and deeply fissured in others  the shoots are stout  with  unlike in the related   the terminal bud present  the
are spirally arranged  and vary in shape from triangular to circular or  rarely  lobed  and with a long   in species in the sections populus and aigeiros  the petioles are laterally flattened  so that breezes easily cause the leaves to wobble back and forth  giving the whole tree a  twinkling  appearance in a breeze  leaf size is very variable even on a single tree  typically with small leaves on side shoots  and very large leaves on strong-growing lead shoots  the leaves often turn bright gold to yellow before they fall during autumn 
the
are mostly
 rarely   and appear in early spring before the leaves  they are borne in long  drooping  sessile or pedunculate
produced from buds formed in the axils of the leaves of the previous year  the flowers are each seated in a cup-shaped disk which is borne on the base of a scale which is itself attached to the rachis of the catkin  the scales are obovate  lobed  and fringed  membranous  hairy or smooth  and usually caducous  the male flowers are without
or   and comprise a group of four to 60
inserted on a disk  filaments are short and pale yellow 
are oblong  purple or red  introrse  and two-celled  the cells open longitudinally  the female flower also has no calyx or corolla  and comprises a single-celled ovary seated in a cup-shaped disk  the style is short  with two to four stigmata  variously lobed  and numerous ovules  pollination is by wind  with the female catkins lengthening considerably between pollination and maturity  the
is a two- to four-valved
  green to reddish-brown  mature in midsummer  containing numerous minute light brown
surrounded by tufts of long  soft  white hairs which aid wind dispersal 
ecology  
poplars of the cottonwood section are often wetlands or
trees  the aspens are among the most important
broadleaf trees 
poplars and aspens are important
for the
of a large number of
species    the aspen oyster mushroom  is found exclusively on dead wood of populus trees in north america 
classification  
a populus on a hill through april  september  october  february  germany 
the genus populus has traditionally been divided into six sections on the basis of leaf and flower characters  this classification is followed below  recent genetic studies have largely supported this  confirming some previously suspected reticulate evolution due to past
and introgression events between the groups  some species  noted below  had differing relationships indicated by their nuclear dna  paternally inherited  and chloroplast dna sequences  maternally inherited   a clear indication of likely hybrid origin  hybridisation continues to be common in the genus  with several hybrids between species in different sections known

cultivation  
fastigiate black poplar cultivar of the plantierensis group  in
poplars dominate the flora of
city park   
many poplars are grown as   with numerous
used  they have the advantage of growing to a very large size at a rapid pace  almost all poplars take root readily from cuttings or where broken branches lie on the ground  they also often have remarkable suckering abilities  and can form huge colonies from a single original tree  such as the famous
forest made of thousands of
clones  
trees with
 erect  columnar  branching are particularly popular  and are widely grown across europe and southwest asia  however  like   poplars have very vigorous and invasive root systems stretching up to 40m from the trees  planting close to houses or ceramic water pipes may result in damaged foundations and cracked walls and pipes due to their search for moisture 
a simple  reproducible  high-frequency micropropagation protocol in eastern cottonwood populus deltoides has been reported by yadav et al  2009
india  
popular populus variety g48 in punjab  india  jhalli farms village niara hoshiarpur
in india  the poplar is grown commercially by farmers  mainly in the punjab region  common poplar varieties are 
g48  grown in the plains of punjab  haryana  up 
w22  grown in mountainous regions  e g   himachal pradesh  pathankot  jammu 
the trees are grown from kalam or cuttings  harvested annually in january and february  and commercially available up to 15november 
most commonly used to make  
in
state has a large plywood industry reliant upon poplar  it is graded according to sizes known as  over   over 24 inches  610mm     under   1824 inches  460610mm    and  sokta   less than 18 inches  460mm   
uses  
traditional
house
although the wood from populus is known as poplar wood  a common high-quality hardwood  poplar  with a greenish colour is actually from an unrelated genus   populus wood is a lighter  more porous material 
its flexibility and close grain make it suitable for a number of applications  similar to those for willow  the greeks and etruscans made shields of poplar  and pliny also recommended poplar for this purpose  poplar continued to be used for shield construction through the middle ages and was renowned for a durability similar to that of oak  but at a substantial reduction in weight 
manufacturing  
in many areas  fast-growing
poplars are grown on
for
poplar is widely used for the manufacture of  
it is also sold as inexpensive hardwood   used for
and cheap   more specialised uses include
and the boxes in which
is sold 
poplar wood is also widely used in the
industry for the snowboard core  because it has exceptional flexibility  and is sometimes used in the bodies of
and  
poplar wood  particularly when seasoned  makes a good hearth for a  
due to its high
content  the bark has been used in europe for tanning leather 
poplar wood can be used to produce
or  
baking
from
poplar may be used in the freezer  oven  or microwave oven 
energy  
interest exists in using poplar as an
for
or   in
systems  particularly in light of its high energy-in to energy-out ratio  large carbon mitigation potential  and fast growth 
rotor poplar and willow cuttings planter  planting a new nursery of poplar for biomass with short rotation
in the   poplar  as with fellow energy crop willow  is typically grown in a
system for two to five years  with single or multiple stems   then harvested and burned - the yield of some varieties can be as high as 12 oven-dry tonnes per hectare every year
art and literature  
poplar was the most common wood used in italy for   the
and most famous early renaissance italian paintings are on poplar  the wood is generally white  often with a slightly yellowish colour 
some
are made with one-piece poplar backs 
made in this fashion are said   to have a particularly resonant tone  similarly  though typically it is considered to have a less attractive grain than the traditional   poplar is beginning to be targeted by some
as a sustainable and even superior alternative for their   in these cases another hardwood veneer is sometimes applied to the resonant poplar base both for cosmetic reasons  and supposedly to fine-tune the acoustic properties 
two notable poems in english lament the cutting down of poplars   s  the poplar field  and     felled 1879  
 s poem    mentions poplar trees in the context of  
the odd poplers alley  in   romania  is one of the spots where
sought inspiration in his works  the poem  down where the lonely poplars grow    in 1973  the 15 white poplars still left  with age ranges between 233 and 371 years  were declared natural monuments 
resistance against termites  
in pakistan  poplar is grown on commercial level by farmers in punjab  sindh  and khyber pakhtunkhwa provinces  however  all varieties are seriously susceptible to termite attack  causing significant losses to poplar every year  logs of poplar are therefore also used in termite traps  termaps  for biocontrol of termites in crops 
land management  
are frequently used as a
around agricultural fields to protect against wind erosion 
agriculture  
logs from the poplar provide a growing medium for
mushrooms
