micro combined heat and power or micro-chp is an extension of the idea of
to the single multi family home or small office building in the range of up to 50   local generation has a higher efficiency as it lacks the 8-10  energy losses when transporting
over long distances and the 1015  energy losses on
in district heating networks due to the difference between the thermal energy carrier  hot water  and the colder external environment  the most common systems use natural gas as their primary energy source and emit

overview  
combined heat and power  chp  systems for homes or small commercial buildings are often fueled by
to produce electricity and heat  a micro-chp system is a small
or a
driving a generator which provide
and heat for an individual building s   a micro-chp may primarily follow heat demand  delivering
as the by-product  or may follow electrical demand to
and heat is the by-product  when used primarily for heat in circumstances of fluctuating electrical demand  micro-chp systems may generate more electricity than is instantly being demanded 
the heat engine version is a small scale example of
schemes which have been used with large electric power plants  the purpose is to utilize more of the energy in the fuel  the reason for using such systems is that   such as
which generate the electric power needed for modern life by burning fuel  are not very efficient  due to   a heat engine cannot be 100  efficient  it cannot convert anywhere near all the heat produced from the fuel it burns into useful forms such as electricity  so heat engines always produce a surplus of low-temperature   called  secondary heat  or  low-grade heat   modern plants are limited to efficiencies of about 3360  at most  so 4067  of the energy is exhausted as waste heat  in the past this energy was usually wasted to the environment 
systems  built in recent years in cold-climate countries  utilize the waste heat produced by large power plants for heating  piping hot water from the plant into buildings in the surrounding community 
however  it is not practical to transport heat long distances  due to heat loss from the pipes  since electricity can be transported practically  it is more efficient to generate the electricity near where the waste heat can be used  so in a  micro-combined heat and power system   micro-chp   small power plants are instead located where the secondary heat can be used  in individual buildings  micro-chp are defined by the ec as being of less than 50kw electrical power output 
in a central power plant  the supply of  waste heat  may exceed the local heat demand  in such cases  if it is not desirable to reduce the power production  the excess waste heat must be disposed in e g 
or
without being used  a way to avoid excess waste heat is to reduce the fuel input to the chp plant  reducing both the heat and power output to balance the heat demand  in doing this  the power production is limited by the heat demand 
in a traditional
delivering electricity to consumers  about 30  of the heat content of the primary heat energy source  such as        
or   reaches the consumer  although the efficiency can be 20  for very old plants and 45  for newer gas plants  in contrast  a chp system converts 15 42  of the primary heat to electricity  and most of the remaining heat is captured for
or   in total  as much as 90  of the heat from the primary energy source goes to useful purposes when heat production does not exceed the demand 
chp systems are able to increase the total energy utilization of primary energy sources  such as fuel and concentrated
energy  thus chp has been steadily gaining popularity in all sectors of the energy economy  due to the increased costs of electricity and fuel  particularly fossil fuels  and due to environmental concerns  particularly  
chp systems have benefited the industrial sector since the beginning of the industrial revolution  for three decades  these larger chp systems were more economically justifiable than micro-chp  due to the   after the year 2000  micro-chp has become cost effective in many markets around the world  due to rising energy costs  the development of micro-chp systems has also been facilitated by recent technological developments of small heat engines  this includes improved performance and cost-effectiveness of        
and  
fuel cell mchp operates at low temperature  50 to 100c  and needs high purity hydrogen  its prone to contamination  changes are made to operate at higher temperatures and improvements on the fuel reformer 
fuel cell mchp operates at a high temperature  500 to 1,000 cp  and can handle different energy sources well but the high temperature requires expensive materials to handle the temperature  changes are made to operate at a lower temperature  because of the higher temperature sofc in general has a longer start-up time and need continuous heat output even in times when there is no thermal demand 
chp systems linked to
can use waste heat for  
a 2013 uk report from ecuity consulting stated that mchp is the most cost-effective method of utilising gas to generate energy at the domestic level 
delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64  of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional engine-based micro-chp systems in sales in 2012 
technologies  
micro-chp engine systems are currently based on several different technologies 
   using either the traditional water or  
fuels  
there are many types of fuels and sources of heat that may be considered for micro-chp  the properties of these sources vary in terms of system cost  heat cost  environmental effects  convenience  ease of transportation and storage  system maintenance  and system life  some of the heat sources and fuels that are being considered for use with micro-chp include        vegetable oil  such as
oil       and lately also   as well as multi-fuel systems  the energy sources with the lowest emissions of particulates and net-carbon dioxide include solar power  hydrogen  biomass  with two-stage gasification into    and natural gas  due to the high efficiency of the chp process  cogeneration has still lower carbon emissions compared to energy transformation in fossil driven boilers or thermal power plants 
the majority of cogeneration systems use natural gas for fuel  because natural gas burns easily and cleanly  it can be inexpensive  it is available in most areas and is easily transported through pipelines  which already exist for many homes 
engine types  
natural gas is suitable for   such as
and
systems  gas turbines are used in many small systems due to their high efficiency  small size  clean combustion  durability and low maintenance requirements  gas turbines designed with
and air-cooling operate without lubricating oil or coolants  the waste heat of gas turbines is mostly in the exhaust  whereas the waste heat of
is split between the exhaust and cooling system 
can run on any high-temperature heat source  these engines include the   hot  gas  turbocharger  and the   both range from 10 -20  efficiency  and as of 2014  small quantities are in production for micro-chp products 
other possibilities include the   which operates at lower temperatures and pressures using low-grade heat sources  the primary advantage to this is that the equipment is essentially an air-conditioning or refrigeration unit operating as an engine  whereby the piping and other components need not be designed for extreme temperatures and pressures  reducing cost and complexity  electrical efficiency suffers  but it is presumed that such a system would be utilizing waste heat or a heat source such as a wood stove or gas boiler that would exist anyway for purposes of space heating 
the future of combined heat and power  particularly for homes and small businesses  will continue to be affected by the price of fuel  including natural gas  as fuel prices continue to climb  this will make the economics more favorable for energy conservation measures  and more   including chp and micro-chp 
fuel cells  
fuel cells generate electricity and heat as a by product  the advantages for a
over stirling chp are no moving parts  less maintenance  and quieter operation  the surplus electricity can be delivered back to the grid 
pemfc fuel cells fueled by natural gas or propane use a
to convert methane in the gas supply into
and hydrogen  the hydrogen then reacts with oxygen in the fuel cell to produce electricity  a
based micro-chp has an electrical efficiency of 37 
and 33 
and a
efficiency of 52  lhv and 47  hhv with a
of 40,000 hours or 4000 start stop cycles which is equal to 10 year use  an estimated 138,000 fuel cell chp systems below 1kw had been installed in japan by the end of 2014  most of these chp systems are pemfc based  85   and the remaining are sofc systems 
in 2013
is around 60,000 hours  for pem fuel cell units  which shut down at night  this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years

chp pv  
the recent development of small scale chp systems has provided the opportunity for in-house power backup of residential-scale
 pv  arrays  the results of a recent study show that a pv chp hybrid system not only has the potential to radically reduce energy waste in the status quo electrical and heating systems  but it also enables the share of solar pv to be expanded by about a factor of five  in some regions  in order to reduce waste from excess heat  an
has been proposed to utilize the chp-produced thermal energy for cooling of pv-chp system  these  pv systems have the potential to save even more energy 
net metering  
to date  micro-chp systems achieve much of their savings  and thus attractiveness to consumers  by the value of electrical energy which is replaced by the autoproduced electricity  a  generate-and-resell  or
model supports this as home-generated power exceeding the instantaneous in-home needs is sold back to the electrical utility  this system is efficient because the energy used is distributed and used instantaneously over the   the main losses are in the transmission from the source to the consumer which will typically be less than losses incurred by storing energy locally or generating power at less than the peak efficiency of the micro-chp system  so  from a purely technical standpoint
and net-metering are very efficient 
another positive to net-metering is the fact that it is fairly easy to configure  the user s
is simply able to record electrical power exiting as well as entering the home or business  as such  it records the net amount of power entering the home  for a grid with relatively few micro-chp users  no design changes to the electrical grid need be made  additionally  in the   federal and now many state regulations require utility operators to compensate anyone adding power to the grid  from the standpoint of grid operator  these points present operational and technical as well as administrative burdens  as a consequence  most grid operators compensate non- power-contributors at less than or equal to the rate they charge their customers  while this compensation scheme may seem almost fair at first glance  it only represents the consumers cost-savings of not purchasing utility power versus the true cost of generation and operation to the micro-chp operator  thus from the standpoint of micro-chp operators  net-metering is not ideal 
while net-metering is a very efficient mechanism for using excess energy generated by a micro-chp system  it does have detractors  of the detractors  main points  the first to consider is that while the main generating source on the electrical grid is a large commercial generator  net-metering generators  spill  power to the
in a haphazard and unpredictable fashion  however  the effect is negligible if there are only a small percentage of customers generating electricity and each of them generates a relatively small amount of electricity  when turning on an oven or space heater  about the same amount of electricity is drawn from the grid as a home generator puts out  if the percentage of homes with generating systems becomes large  then the effect on the grid may become significant  coordination among the generating systems in homes and the rest of the grid may be necessary for reliable operation and to prevent damage to the grid
