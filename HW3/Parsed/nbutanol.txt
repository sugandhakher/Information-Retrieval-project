n-butanol or n-butyl alcohol or normal butanol is a primary
with a 4- structure and the
c4h9oh  its
include     and   butanol is one of the group of     from the german for  bad liquor    which have more than two carbon atoms and have significant solubility in water 
n-butanol occurs naturally as a minor product of the
of
and other   and is present in many foods and beverages  it is also a permitted artificial flavorant in the united states  used in butter  cream  fruit  rum  whiskey  ice cream and ices  candy  baked goods and cordials  it is also used in a wide range of consumer products 
the largest use of n-butanol is as an industrial intermediate  particularly for the manufacture of
 itself an artificial flavorant and industrial solvent   it is a   manufactured from
and usually used close to the point of manufacture  estimated production figures for 1997 are  united states 784,000tonnes  western europe 575,000tonnes  japan 225,000tonnes 
contents
production  
n-butanol is produced industrially from the petrochemical feedstock   propylene is
to
   in the presence of a -based
similar to   the butyraldehyde is then
to produce n-butanol 
industrial use  
n-butanol is an intermediate in the production of         and other butyl esters  butyl ethers such as  
and   and the corresponding butyl ether acetates  other industrial uses include the manufacture of pharmaceuticals  polymers 
plastics  herbicide esters  printing  e g       and   it is also used as a diluent reactant in the manufacture of  and formaldehyde resins 
other uses  
n-butanol is used as an ingredient in perfumes and as a solvent for the extraction of   n-butanol is also used as an extractant in the manufacture of     and   a solvent for paints  coatings  natural resins  gums  synthetic resins  dyes    and   other miscellaneous applications of n-butanol are as a swelling agent in textiles  as a component of hydraulic   cleaning formulations    and repellents  and as a component of ore floation agents  and of wood-treating systems 
n-butanol has been proposed
for
and   it is produced in small quantities in nearly all
 see    but species of
produce much higher yields of butanol  and research is currently underway to increase the ultimate yield of
from  
the production or  in some cases  use of the following substances may result in exposure to n-butanol        dyes  fruit essences  lacquers  motion picture  and photographic films  raincoats  perfumes 
plastics    safety glass 
varnish  and waterproofed cloth 
occurrence in nature  
use n-butanol as an  
occurrence in food  
n-butanol occurs naturally as a result of carbohydrate fermentation in a number of alcoholic beverages  including beer  grape brandies  wine  and whisky  it has been detected in the volatiles of hops  jack fruit  heat-treated milks  musk melon  cheese  southern pea seed  and cooked rice  n-butanol is also formed during deep frying of corn oil  cottonseed oil  trilinolein  and triolein 
n-butanol is used as an ingredient in processed and artificial flavourings  and for the extraction of lipid-free protein from egg yolk  natural flavouring materials and vegetable oils  the manufacture of hop extract for beermaking  and as a solvent in removing pigments from moist curd  
metabolism and toxicity  
n-butanol is readily absorbed through the intestinal tract and lungs  and also to some extent through the skin  it is metabolized completely in vertebrates in a manner similar to  
converts n-butanol to   this is then converted to
by   butyric acid can be fully metabolized to
and
by the
pathway  in the rat  only 0.03  of an oral dose of 2000mg kg was excreted in the urine 
the acute toxicity of n-butanol is relatively low  with oral
values of 7904360mg kg  rat  comparable values for ethanol are 700015000mg kg   no deaths were reported at an inhaled concentration of 8000ppm  4-hour exposure  rats   at sub-lethal doses  n-butanol acts as a
of the   similar to ethanol  one study in rats indicated that the intoxicating potency of n-butanol is some six times higher than that of ethanol  possibly because of its slower transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase 
n-butanol is a natural component of many alcoholic beverages  albeit in low  but variable  concentrations  it  along with similar   is reputed to be responsible for severe     although experiments in animal models show no evidence for this  an unknown dose n-butanol was consumed by a 47-year-old male with no previous medical history  leading to a range of adverse health effects 
other hazards  
liquid n-butanol  as is common with most organic solvents  is extremely irritating to the eyes  repeated contact with the skin can also cause irritation  this is believed to be a generic effect of  defatting   no skin sensitization has been observed  irritation of the respiratory pathways occurs only at very high concentrations   2400ppm  
with a
of 35c  n-butanol presents a moderate fire hazard  it is slightly more flammable than
or
but less flammable than many other common organic solvents  the depressant effect on the central nervous system  similar to ethanol intoxication  is a potential hazard when working with n-butanol in enclosed spaces  although the odour threshold  0.230ppm  is far below the concentration which would have any neurological effect 
n-butanol is of low toxicity to aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates  it is rapidly biodegraded in water  although an estimated 83  partitions to air where it is degraded by
with a half-life of 1.22.3days  it has low potential to   a potential hazard of significant discharges to watercourses is the rise in
 c o d   associated with its biodegradation
