background  
in 1992  the first conference of its kind  the united nations conference on environment and development  unced   commonly referred to as the rio conference or earth summit  succeeded in raising public awareness of the need to integrate environment and development  the conference drew 109 heads of state to rio de janeiro  brazil  to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development  the earth summit influenced subsequent un conferences  including rio 20 and set the global green agenda  the world conference on human rights  for example  focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development  controversial demands that had met with resistance from some member states until the earth summit 
major outcomes of the conference include the
 unfccc  a climate-change agreement that led to the     the
 cbd  and the
 unccd   it also created new international institutions  among them the commission on sustainable development  tasked with the follow-up to the rio conference and led to the reform of the  
ten years later 
informally nicknamed rio 10 was held in johannesburg  south africa with the goal of again bringing together leaders from government  business and ngos to agree on a range of measures toward similar goals  at rio 10 
was recognized as an overarching goal for institutions at the national  regional and international levels  there  the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant
agencies  programs and funds was highlighted  the discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the un system 
major outcomes of that conference include the
and almost 300 international partnership initiatives meant to help achieve the  
objectives

the conference had three objectives 
securing renewed political commitment for sustainable development
assessing the progress and implementation gaps in meeting previous commitments 
addressing new and emerging challenges 
conference themes  
the official discussions had two main themes 
how to build a
to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty  including support for developing countries that will allow them to find a green path for development 
how to improve international coordination for sustainable development by building an institutional framework 
rio 20  
in the months leading up to the beginning of the conference  negotiators held frequent informal consultations at un headquarters in new york city  and in the two weeks before the conference was scheduled to begin  they managed to reach consensus on the sensitive language in the then proposed outcome document for the summit 
billed as the biggest un event ever organizedwith 15,000 soldiers and police guarding about 130 heads of state and government  from 192 countries  and the more than 45,000 individuals gathered in rio de janeirothe 10-day mega-conference was intended to be a high-level international gathering organized to re-direct and renew global political commitment to the three dimensions of sustainable development  economic growth  social improvement and environmental protection  focusing on reducing poverty while promoting jobs growth  clean energy and more fair  sustainable uses of resources  goals first established at earth summit in 1992 
the conference centered around agenda 21  the outcome document from earth summit 1992  that document was considered revolutionary in that it essentially created the term sustainable development and created the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years  the representatives of participating governments gathered in rio to discuss what was then the draft text of the outcome document 
rio 20 sought to secure affirmations for the political commitments made at past earth summits and set the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein  and discussing new and emerging issues 
the un wanted rio to endorse a un  green economy roadmap   with environmental goals  targets and deadlines  whereas developing countries preferred establishing new  sustainable development goals  to better protect the environment  guarantee food and power to the poorest  and alleviate poverty 
rio 20 attracted many protests  and more than 500 parallel events  exhibitions  presentations  fairs and announcements as a wide range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention  the british online newspaper  the guardian reported that  downtown rio de janeiro was partly shut-down as an estimated 50,000 protesters  some of whom were naked  took to the streets 
participation  
a few key global leadersmostly g20 leaders and namely united states president barack obama  german chancellor angela merkel  and uk prime minister david camerondid not attend the conference and blamed their absence on the ongoing   their collective absence was seen as a reflection of their administrations failure to prioritize sustainability issues 
 in not attending  the prime minister is sending out a powerful signal that the uk government does not see sustainability as a priority   joan walley  chair of the uk environmental audit committee said to the guardian

as a measure of wealth that take environmental and social factors into account in an effort to assess and pay for environmental services provided by nature  such as carbon sequestration and habitat protection
