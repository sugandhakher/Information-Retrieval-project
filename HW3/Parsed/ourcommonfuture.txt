our common future  also known as the brundtland report  from the
 wced  was published in 1987 
its targets were multilateralism and interdependence of nations in the search for a
path  the report sought to recapture the spirit of the stockholm conference - which had introduced
concerns to the formal political development sphere  our common future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda  it aimed to discuss the environment and
as one single issue 
the document was the culmination of a 900-day international-exercise which catalogued  analysed  and synthesised  written submissions and expert testimony from senior government representatives  scientists and experts  research institutes  industrialists  representatives of non-governmental organizations  and the general public held at public hearings throughout the world 
the brundtland commission s mandate was to 
 re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative  concrete  and realistic action proposals to deal with them 
strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and to assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change  and
raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals  voluntary organizations  businesses  institutes  and governments  1987  347   the commission focused its attention in the areas of population  food security  the loss of species and genetic resources  energy  industry  and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another
the brundtland commission report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction  gender equity  and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation  and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed  as such  the report offered  the  analysis  the broad remedies  and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development within such societies  1987  16   however  the report was unable to identify the mode s  of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment  and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth  the report postulated that such growth could be reformed  and expanded   this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development 
the publication of our common future and the work of the world commission on environment and development laid the groundwork for the convening of the 1992
and the adoption of   the
and to the establishment of the  
an oft-quoted definition of sustainable development is defined in the report as 
 development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs  
in addition  key contributions of our common future to the concept of sustainable development include the recognition that the many crises facing the planet are interlocking crises that are elements of a single crisis of the whole
and of the vital need for the active participation of all sectors of society in consultation and decisions relating to sustainable development 
our common future is also known as the brundtland report in recognition of former norwegian prime minister  s role as chair of the world commission on environment and development
