geothermal power is
by   technologies in use include dry steam power stations  flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations  geothermal electricity generation is currently used in 24 countries  while
is in use in 70 countries 
as of 2015  worldwide geothermal power capacity amounts to 12.8
 gw   of which 28 percent or 3,548 megawatts are installed in the   international markets grew at an average annual rate of 5 percent over the last three years and global geothermal power capacity is expected to reach 14.517.6gw by 2020  based on current geologic knowledge and technology  the
 gea  estimates that only 6.5 percent of total global potential has been tapped so far  while the
reported geothermal power potential to be in the range of 35gw to 2  countries generating more than 15 percent of their electricity from geothermal sources include     the  
and  
geothermal power is considered to be a  
source of energy because the heat extraction is small compared with the earth s heat content  the
of geothermal electric stations are on average 45grams of
per kilowatt-hour of electricity  or less than 5 percent of that of conventional coal-fired plants 
contents
history and development  
in the 20thcentury  demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source 
tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 july 1904 in   italy  it successfully lit four light bulbs  later  in 1911  the world s first commercial geothermal power station was built there  experimental generators were built in   japan and   california  in the 1920s  but italy was the world s only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958 
trends in the top five geothermal electricity-generating countries  19802012  us eia 
global geothermal electric capacity  upper red line is installed capacity  lower green line is realized production 
in 1958  new zealand became the second major industrial producer of geothermal electricity when its
was commissioned  wairakei was the first station to use flash steam technology 
in 1960 
began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power station in the united states at the geysers in california  the original turbine lasted for more than 30years and produced 11 net power 
the binary cycle power station was first demonstrated in 1967 in russia and later introduced to the usa in 1981  following the
and significant changes in regulatory policies  this technology allows the use of much lower temperature resources than were previously recoverable  in 2006  a binary cycle station in   came on-line  producing electricity from a record low fluid temperature of 57c  135f  
geothermal electric stations have until recently been built exclusively where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface  the development of
and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable
over a much greater geographical range  demonstration projects are operational in   germany  and   france  while an earlier effort in   switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes  other demonstration projects are under construction in   the   and the  
the
of geothermal electric stations is low  around 710   because geothermal fluids are at a low temperature compared with steam from boilers  by the laws of
this low temperature limits the efficiency of
in extracting useful energy during the generation of electricity  exhaust heat is wasted  unless it can be used directly and locally  for example in greenhouses  timber mills  and district heating  the efficiency of the system does not affect operational costs as it would for a coal or other fossil fuel plant  but it does factor into the viability of the station  in order to produce more energy than the pumps consume  electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles    because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy  unlike  for example  wind or solar  its
can be quite large  up to 96  has been demonstrated  however the global average
was 74.5  in 2008  according to the  
resources  
enhanced geothermal system 1 reservoir 2 pumphouse 3 heatexchanger 4 turbinehall 5 productionwell 6 injectionwell 7 hot water to district heating 8 poroussediments 9 observationwell 10 crystallinebedrock
the earths heat content is about   this heat naturally flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of 44.2
 tw  and is replenished by radioactive decay at a rate of 30tw  these power rates are more than double humanitys current energy consumption from primary sources  but most of this power is too diffuse  approximately 0.1 w m2 on average  to be recoverable  the
effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits  of   water or other  to release the heat underneath 
electricity generation requires high temperature resources that can only come from deep underground  the heat must be carried to the surface by fluid circulation  either through         drilled water wells  or a combination of these  this circulation sometimes exists naturally where the crust is thin  magma conduits bring heat close to the surface  and hot springs bring the heat to the surface  if no hot spring is available  a well must be drilled into a hot   away from tectonic plate boundaries the
is 2530c per kilometre  km  of depth in most of the world  and wells would have to be several kilometres deep to permit electricity generation  the quantity and quality of recoverable resources improves with drilling depth and proximity to tectonic plate boundaries 
in ground that is hot but dry  or where water pressure is inadequate  injected fluid can stimulate production  developers bore two holes into a candidate site  and fracture the rock between them with explosives or high pressure water  then they pump water or liquefied carbon dioxide down one borehole  and it comes up the other borehole as a gas  this approach is called
in europe  or
in north america  much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers 
estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from 35 to 2000gw depending on the scale of investments  this does not include non-electric heat recovered by co-generation  geothermal heat pumps and other direct use  a 2006 report by
 mit   that included the potential of enhanced geothermal systems  estimated that investing 1billion usdollars in research and development over 15years would allow the creation of 100gw of electrical generating capacity by 2050 in the united states alone  the mit report estimated that over 200 zj  would be extractable  with the potential to increase this to over 2,000zj with technology improvements  sufficient to provide all the world s present energy needs for several  
at present  geothermal wells are rarely more than 3 kilometres  1.9mi  deep  upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as 10 kilometres  6.2mi   drilling near this depth is now possible in the petroleum industry  although it is an expensive process  the deepest research well in the world  the   is 12.3km  7.6mi  deep  this record has recently been imitated by commercial oil wells  such as  s z-12 well in the chayvo field    wells drilled to depths greater than 4 kilometres  2.5mi  generally incur drilling costs in the tens of millions of dollars  the technological challenges are to drill wide bores at low cost and to break larger volumes of rock 
geothermal power is considered to be sustainable because the heat extraction is small compared to the earth s heat content  but extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion  although geothermal sites are capable of providing heat for many decades  individual wells may cool down or run out of water  the three oldest sites  at larderello    and the geysers have all reduced production from their peaks  it is not clear whether these stations extracted energy faster than it was replenished from greater depths  or whether the aquifers supplying them are being depleted  if production is reduced  and water is reinjected  these wells could theoretically recover their full potential  such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites  the long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the lardarello field in italy since 1913  at the wairakei field in new zealand since 1958  and at the geysers field in california since 1960 
power station types  
dry steam station
flash steam station
geothermal power stations are similar to other steam turbine
 heat from a fuel source  in geothermal s case  the earth s core  is used to heat water or another working fluid  the working fluid is then used to turn a turbine of a generator  thereby producing electricity  the fluid is then cooled and returned to the heat source 
dry steam power stations  
dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design  they directly use geothermal steam of 150c or greater to turn turbines 
flash steam power stations  
flash steam stations pull deep  high-pressure hot water into lower-pressure tanks and use the resulting flashed steam to drive turbines  they require fluid temperatures of at least 180c  usually more  this is the most common type of station in operation today  flash steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than 360f  182   the hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure  as it flows upward  the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam  the steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine generator  any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir  making this a potentially sustainable resource 
at
in california  twenty years of power production had depleted the groundwater and operations were substantially reduced  to restore some of the former capacity  water injection was developed 
binary cycle power stations  
main article 
binary cycle power stations are the most recent development  and can accept fluid temperatures as low as 57c  the moderately hot geothermal water is passed by a secondary fluid with a much lower boiling point than water  this causes the secondary fluid to flash vaporize  which then drives the turbines  this is the most common type of geothermal electricity station being constructed today  both
and
are used  the thermal efficiency of this type station is typically about 1013  
worldwide production  
geothermal station  in italy
the international geothermal association  iga  has reported that 10,715
 mw  of geothermal power in 24 countries is online  which is expected to generate 67,246
of electricity in 2010  this represents a 20  increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005  iga projected this would grow to 18,500 mw by 2015  due to the large number of projects that were under consideration  often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource 
in 2010  the
led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 mw of installed capacity from 77 power stations  the largest group of geothermal
in the world is located at   a geothermal field in   the philippines follows the us as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world  with 1,904 mw of capacity online  geothermal power makes up approximately 27  of the country s electricity generation 
said in the climate project asia pacific summit that indonesia could become a super power country in electricity production from geothermal energy  india has announced a plan to develop the country s first geothermal power facility in chhattisgarh 
canada is the only major country on the
which has not yet developed geothermal power  the region of greatest potential is the   stretching from
to the yukon  where estimates of generating output have ranged from 1,550 mw to 5,000 mw 
utility-grade stations

the largest group of geothermal
in the world is located at   a geothermal field in     as of 2004  five countries          and   generate more than 15  of their electricity from geothermal sources 
geothermal electricity is generated in the 24 countries listed in the table below  during 2005  contracts were placed for an additional 500
of electrical capacity in the united states  while there were also stations under construction in 11 other countries  enhanced geothermal systems that are several kilometres in depth are operational in france and germany and are being developed or evaluated in at least four other countries

existing geothermal electric stations  that fall within the

2 per megawatt-hour when not coupled with
 ccs  
stations that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are usually equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust  geothermal stations could theoretically inject these gases back into the earth  as a form of carbon capture and storage 
in addition to dissolved gases  hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic chemicals  such as         and salt  these chemicals come out of solution as the water cools  and can cause environmental damage if released  the modern practice of injecting geothermal fluids back into the earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk 
station construction can adversely affect land stability

geothermal has minimal land and freshwater requirements  geothermal stations use 404squaremeters per versus 3,632 and 1,335squaremeters for coal facilities and wind farms respectively  they use 20litres of freshwater per mwh versus over 1000litres permwh for nuclear  coal  or oil 
geothermal power stations can also disrupt the natural cycles of geysers  for example  the
geysers  which were uncapped geothermal wells  stopped erupting due to the development of the dual-flash station 
economics  
geothermal power requires no fuel  it is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations  however 
tend to be high  drilling accounts for over half the costs  and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks  a typical well doublet in nevada can support 4.5
 mw  of electricity generation and costs about  10 million to drill  with a 20  failure rate  in total  electrical station construction and well drilling costs about 25million permw of electrical capacity  while the
is 0.040.10 perkwh  enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges  with capital costs above  4million permw and levelized costs above  0.054 perkwh in 2007 
geothermal power is highly scalable  a small power station can supply a rural village  though initial capital costs can be high 
the most developed geothermal field is the geysers in california  in 2008  this field supported 15 stations  all owned by   with a total generating capacity of 725mw
