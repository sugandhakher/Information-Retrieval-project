effect  for the
term  see  
in
and   the rebound effect  or take-back effect  re  is the reduction in expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of
use  because of behavioral or other systemic responses  these responses usually tend to offset the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken  while the literature on the rebound effect generally focuses on the effect of technological improvements on energy consumption  the theory can also be applied to the use of any
or other input  such as   the rebound effect is generally expressed as a ratio of the lost benefit compared to the expected environmental benefit when holding consumption constant 
for instance  if a 5  improvement in vehicle
results in only a 2  drop in fuel use  there is a 60  rebound effect  since  5-2 5   60    the  missing  3  might have been consumed by driving faster or further than before 
the existence of the rebound effect is uncontroversial  however  debate continues as to the magnitude and impact of the effect in real world situations  depending on the magnitude of the rebound effect  there are five different rebound effect types 
super conservation  re   0   the actual resource savings are higher than expected savings  the rebound effect is negative  this occurs if the increase in efficiency reduces costs 
zero rebound  re   0   the actual resource savings are equal to expected savings  the rebound effect is zero 
partial rebound  0   re   1   the actual resource savings are less than expected savings  the rebound effect is between 0  and 100   this is sometimes known as  take-back   and is the most common result of empirical studies on individual markets 
full rebound  re   1   the actual resource savings are equal to the increase in usage  the rebound effect is at 100  
backfire  re   1   the actual resource savings are negative because usage increased beyond potential savings  the rebound effect is higher than 100   this situation is commonly known as the  
in order to avoid the rebound effect  environmental economists have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be taxed in order to keep the cost of use the same

history

and
the rebound effect was first described by
in his 1865 book   where he observed that the invention in britain of a more efficient steam engine meant that the use of coal became economically viable for many new uses  this ultimately led to increased coal demand and much increased coal consumption  even as the amount of coal required for any particular use fell  according to jevons   it is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption  the very contrary is the truth  
however  most contemporary authors credit daniel khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound effect in the research literature  although khazzoom did not use the term  he raised the idea that there is a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in energy efficiency and reductions in energy use  because of a change in the  price content  of energy in the provision of the final consumer product  his study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances  but the principle applies throughout the economy  a commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car  as each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper  there will be an increase in driving speed and or kilometres driven  as long as the
for car travel is not zero  other examples might include the growth in
after the introduction of energy-saving
or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies  if the rebound effect is larger than 100   all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand  the   
khazzoom s thesis was criticized heavily by michael grubb and
who dismissed any disconnection between energy efficiency improvements in an individual market  and an economy-wide reduction in energy consumption  developing khazzoom s idea further  and prompting heated debate in the energy policy journal at that time  len brookes wrote of the fallacies in the energy-efficiency solution to greenhouse gas emissions  his analysis showed that any economically justified improvements in energy efficiency would in fact stimulate economic growth and increase total energy use  for improvements in energy efficiency to contribute to a reduction in economy-wide energy consumption  the improvement must come at a greater economic cost  commenting in regard to energy efficiency advocates  he concludes that   the present high profile of the topic seems to owe more to the current tide of green fervor than to sober consideration of the facts  and the validity and cost of solutions  
khazzoom-brookes postulate  
in 1992  economist harry saunders coined the term    to describe the idea that energy efficiency gains paradoxically result in increases in energy use  the modern day equivalent of the    he modeled energy efficiency gains using a variety of neo-classical growth models  and showed that the postulate is true over a wide range of assumptions  in the conclusion of his paper  saunders stated that 
in the absence of efficiency gains  energy use will grow in lock step with economic growth  energy intensity will stay fixed  when energy prices are fixed   energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption by two means  by making energy appear effectively cheaper than other inputs  and by increasing economic growth  which pulls up energy use   these results  while by no means proving the khazzoom-brookes postulate  call for prudent energy analysts and policy makers to pause a long moment before dismissing it 
this work provided a theoretical grounding for empirical studies and played an important role in framing the problem of the rebound effect  it also reinforced an emerging ideological divide between energy economists on the extent of the yet to be named effect  the two tightly held positions are 
technological improvements in energy efficiency enable economic growth that was otherwise impossible without the improvement  as such  energy efficiency improvements will usually back-fire in the long term 
technological improvements in energy efficiency may result in a small take-back  however  even in the long term  energy efficiency improvements usually result in large overall energy savings 
even though many studies have been undertaken in this area  neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature  recent studies have demonstrated that direct rebound effects are significant  about 30  for energy   but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often back-fire occurs  economists tend to the first position  but most governments  businesses  and environmental groups adhere to the second  governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing
emissions  to alleviate the impacts of    however  if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality  current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use  and may in fact paradoxically increase
and
consumption  and
emissions  over the long run 
types of effects  
the full rebound effect can be distinguished into three different economic reactions to technological changes 
direct rebound effect  an increase in consumption of a good is caused by the lower cost of use  this is caused by the  
indirect rebound effect  the lower cost of a service enables increased household consumption of other goods and services  for example  the savings from a more efficient cooling system may be put into another luxury good  this is caused by the  
economy wide effect  the fall in service cost reduces the price of other goods  creates new production possibilities and increases economic growth 
in the example of improved vehicle fuel efficiency  the direct effect would be the increased fuel use from more driving as driving becomes cheaper  the indirect effect would incorporate the increased consumption of other goods enabled by household cost savings from increased fuel efficiency  since consumption of other goods increase  the embodied fuel used in the production of those goods would increase as well  finally  the economy wide effect would include the long-term effect of the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency on production and consumption possibilities throughout the economy  including any effects on economic growth rates 
direct and indirect effects  
direct and indirect effects
for cost reducing resource efficiency  distinguishing between direct and indirect effects is shown in figure 1 below  the horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good  which could be for example clothes washing  and measured in terms of kilograms of clean clothes  with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis  an economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing  this shifts the household budget line rightwards  the result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price  but also an income effect due to the increased real income  the substitution effect increases consumption of washing from q1 to qs  and the income effect from qs to q2  the total increase in consumption of washing from q1 to q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect  the indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption  from o1 to o2  the scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods  and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good  indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically  in the manufacturing sector  it has been estimated that there is about a 24  rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency  a parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers  where output and substitution effects will occur 
the rebound effect can increase the difficulty of projecting the reduction in greenhouse emissions from an improvement in energy efficiency  estimation of the scale of direct effects on residential electricity  heating and motor fuel consumption has been common motivation for research of rebound effects  evaluation and econometric methods are the two approaches generally employed in estimating the size of this effect  evaluation methods rely on quasi-experimental studies and measure the before and after changes to energy consumption from the implementation of energy efficient technology  while econometric methods utilize
to forecast the likely effects from changes in the effective price of energy services 
research has found that in   the direct rebound effect is usually small to moderate  ranging from roughly 5  to 40  in residential space heating and cooling  some of the direct rebound effect can be attributed to consumers who were previously unable to use a service  however  the rebound effect may be more significant in the context of the undeveloped markets in  
indirect effects from conservation  
figure2  change in preferences of a household revealing indirect effects from conservation
for conservation measures  indirect effects closely approximate the total economy wide effect  conservation measures constitute a change in consumption patterns away from particular targeted goods towards other goods  figure 2 shows that a change in preference of a household results in a new consumption pattern that has less of the target good  qt to qt    and more of all other goods  qo to qo    the resource consumption or externalities embodied in this other consumption is the indirect effect 
although a persuasive view has prevailed that indirect effects with respect to energy and greenhouse emissions should be very small due to energy directly comprising only a small component of household expenditure  this view is gradually being eroded  many recent studies based on life-cycle analysis show the energy consumed indirectly by households is often higher than consumed directly through electricity  gas  and motor fuel  and is a growing proportion  this is evident in the results of recent studies that indicate indirect effects from household conservation can range from 10  to 200  depending on the scenario  with higher indirect rebounds from diet changes aiming to reduce  
economy wide effects  
even if the direct and indirect rebound effects add up to less than 100   technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy wide effects that results in increased resource use for the economy as a whole  in particular  this would happen if resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy  and an increase in the rate of   for example  for the case of energy use  more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources  it is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates  in the 1970s sharp increases in petroleum prices led to
  and   in the developed countries  whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth  an improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices  and leads to faster economic growth  economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use  more efficient technologies will lead to increased use  because of this growth effect 
to model the scale of this effect  economists use computational general equilibrium  cge  models  while cge methodology is by no means perfect  results indicate that economy wide rebound effects are likely to be very high  with estimates above 100  rather common  one simple cge model has been made available online for use by economists 
income level variation  
research has shown that the direct rebound effects for energy services is lower at high income levels  due to less price sensitivity  studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by uk households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile  studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology  evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient heating installations in lower income homes in the united kingdom  this research found that direct effects are close to 100  in many cases  high income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level  regardless of the cost  therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating  for it was already optimal  but low-income households are more price sensitive  and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating  in this case  a high direct rebound is likely  this analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption 
the size of the rebound effect is likely to be higher in developing countries according to macro-level assessments
and case studies  one case study was undertaken in rural india to evaluate the impact of an alternative energy scheme  households were given solar powered lighting in an attempt to reduce the use of kerosene for lighting to zero except for seasons with insufficient sunshine  the scheme was also designed to encourage a future willingness to pay for efficient lighting  the results were surprising  with high direct rebounds between 50 and 80   and total direct and indirect rebound above 100   because the new lighting source was essentially zero cost  operating hours for lighting went up from an average of 2 to 6 per day  with new lighting consisting of a combination of both the no-cost solar lamps and also kerosene lamps  also  more cooking was undertaken which enabled an increased trade of food with neighboring villages 
rebounds with respect to time  
the individual opportunity of cost is an often overlooked cause of rebound effect  time is being substituted with an increase in demand for a service  research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand  because time cost forms a major part of the total cost of commuter transport  rapid modes will reduce real costs  but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption  while important  it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time  time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect  labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates  for leisure time saving  this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time 
suggested solutions  
in order to ensure that efficiency enhancing technological improvements actually reduce fuel use  the
and
have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be  taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation  preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in natural capital rehabilitation   this can be achieved through  for example  the imposition of a   a
program  higher
or the proposed  restore  approach  policies can also directly address projected yearly consumption of energy rather than device efficiency  especially for systems where the use can be accurately projected  such as street lighting
