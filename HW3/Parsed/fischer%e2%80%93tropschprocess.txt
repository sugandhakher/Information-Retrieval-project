reaction mechanism  
the fischertropsch process involves a series of chemical reactions that produce a variety of hydrocarbons  ideally having the formula  cnh2n 2   the more useful reactions produce
as follows 
 2n   1 h2   nco  cnh2n 2   nh2o
where n is typically 1020  the formation of methane  n   1  is unwanted  most of the alkanes produced tend to be straight-chain  suitable as   in addition to alkane formation  competing reactions give small amounts of   as well as
and other oxygenated hydrocarbons 
fischertropsch intermediates and elemental reactions  
converting a mixture of h2 and co into aliphatic products obviously should be a multi-step reaction with several sorts of intermediates  the growth of the hydrocarbon chain may be visualized as involving a repeated sequence in which hydrogen atoms are added to carbon and oxygen  the co bond is split and a new cc bond is formed  for one ch2 group produced by co   2h2   ch2    h2o  several reactions are necessary 
associative adsorption of co
splitting of the co bond
dissociative adsorption of 2h2
transfer of 2h to the oxygen to yield h2o
desorption of h2o
transfer of 2h to the carbon to yield ch2
the conversion of co to alkanes involves
of co  the
 cleavage with h2  of co bonds  and the formation of cc bonds  such reactions are assumed to proceed via initial formation of surface-bound   the co
is speculated to undergo dissociation  possibly into oxide and
ligands  other potential intermediates are various c1 fragments including formyl  cho   hydroxycarbene  hcoh   hydroxymethyl  ch2oh  
 ch3   methylene  ch2  
 ch   and hydroxymethylidyne  coh   furthermore  and critical to the production of liquid fuels  are reactions that form cc bonds  such as   many related stoichiometric reactions have been simulated on discrete   but homogeneous fischertropsch catalysts are poorly developed and of no commercial importance 
addition of isotopically labelled alcohol to the feed stream results in incorporation of alcohols into product  this observation establishes the facility of co bond scission  using 14c-labelled
and
over cobalt catalysts results in incorporation of these olefins into the growing chain  chain growth reaction thus appears to involve both olefin insertion as well as co-insertion 
feedstocks  gasification  
fischertropsch plants associated with coal or related solid feedstocks  sources of carbon  must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants  i e   co  h2  and alkanes  this conversion is called
and the product is called
  syngas    synthesis gas obtained from coal gasification tends to have a h2 co ratio of  0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of  2  this ratio is adjusted via the   coal-based fischertropsch plants produce varying amounts of co2  depending upon the energy source of the gasification process  however  most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the fischertropsch process 
feedstocks  gtl  
carbon monoxide for ft catalysis is derived from hydrocarbons  in
 gtl  technology  the hydrocarbons are low molecular weight materials that often would be discarded or flared  stranded gas provides relatively cheap gas  gtl is viable provided gas remains relatively cheaper than oil 
several reactions are required to obtain the gaseous reactants required for fischertropsch   first  reactant gases entering a fischertropsch reactor must be   otherwise  sulfur-containing impurities deactivate      the catalysts required for fischertropsch reactions 
several reactions are employed to adjust the h2 co ratio  most important is the   which provides a source of hydrogen at the expense of carbon monoxide 
h2o   co  h2   co2
for fischertropsch plants that use methane as the   another important reaction is   which converts the methane into co and h2 
h2o   ch4  co   3h2
process conditions  
generally  the fischertropsch process is operated in the temperature range of 150300c  302572f   higher temperatures lead to faster reactions and higher conversion rates but also tend to favor methane production  for this reason  the temperature is usually maintained at the low to middle part of the range  increasing the pressure leads to higher conversion rates and also favors formation of long-chained   both of which are desirable  typical pressures range from one to several tens of atmospheres  even higher pressures would be favorable  but the benefits may not justify the additional costs of high-pressure equipment  and higher pressures can lead to catalyst deactivation via coke formation 
a variety of synthesis-gas compositions can be used  for cobalt-based catalysts the optimal h2 co ratio is around 1.82.1  iron-based catalysts promote the water-gas-shift reaction and thus can tolerate lower ratios  this reactivity can be important for synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass  which tend to have relatively low h2 co ratios   1  
design of the fischer-tropsch process reactor  
efficient removal of heat from the reactor is the basic need of fischertropsch reactors since these reactions are characterized by high exothermicity  four types of reactors are discussed 
multi tubular fixed-bed reactor
this type of reactor contains a number of tubes with small diameter  these tubes contain catalyst and are surrounded by boiling water which removes the heat of reaction  a fixed-bed reactor is suitable for operation at low temperatures and has an upper temperature limit of 530k  excess temperature leads to carbon deposition and hence blockage of the reactor  since large amounts of the products formed are in liquid state  this type of reactor can also be referred to as a trickle flow reactor system 
entrained flow reactor
an important requirement of the reactor for the fischertropsch process is to remove the heat of the reaction  this type of reactor contains two banks of heat exchangers which remove heat  the remainder of which is removed by the products and recycled in the system  the formation of heavy waxes should be avoided  since they condense on the catalyst and form agglomerations  this leads to fluidization  hence  risers are operated over 570k 
slurry reactors
heat removal is done by internal cooling coils  the synthesis gas is bubbled through the waxy products and finely-divided catalyst which is suspended in the liquid medium  this also provides agitation of the contents of the reactor  the catalyst particle size reduces diffusional heat and mass transfer limitations  a lower temperature in the reactor leads to a more viscous product and a higher temperature   570k  gives an undesirable product spectrum  also  separation of the product from the catalyst is a problem 
fluid-bed and circulating catalyst  riser  reactors
these are used for high-temperature fischertropsch synthesis  nearly 340c  to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on alkalized fused iron catalysts  the fluid-bed technology  as adapted from the catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates  was introduced by hydrocarbon research in 194650 and named the hydrocol process  a large scale fischertropsch hydrocol plant  350,000 tons per annum  operated during 195157 in brownsville  texas  due to technical problems  and lacking economy due to increasing petroleum availability  this development was discontinued  fluid-bed fischertropsch synthesis has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by sasol  one reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built  nearly 850,000 tons per annum   the process is now used mainly for c2 and c7 alkene production  this new development can be regarded as an important progress in fischertropsch technology  a high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst  circulating fluid bed  riser reactor  entrained catalyst process  was introduced by the kellogg company and a respective plant built at sasol in 1956  it was improved by sasol for successful operation  at secunda  south africa  sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each  now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior sasol-advanced fluid-bed technology  early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by fischer  the bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a co-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by klbel at the rheinpreuben company in 1953  recently  since 1990  low-temperature fischertropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts  particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wa  or to be hydrocracked and isomerised to produce diesel fuel  by exxon and sasol  today slurry-phase  bubble column  low-temperature fischertropsch synthesis is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for fischertropsch clean diesel production  this fischertropsch technology is also under development by the statoil company  norway  for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid 
product distribution  
in general the product distribution of hydrocarbons formed during the fischertropsch process follows an andersonschulzflory distribution  which can be expressed as 
wn n    1   2n1
where wn is the weight fraction of hydrocarbons containing n carbon atoms   is the chain growth probability or the probability that a molecule will continue reacting to form a longer chain  in general   is largely determined by the catalyst and the specific process conditions 
examination of the above equation reveals that methane will always be the largest single product so long as  is less than 0.5  however  by increasing  close to one  the total amount of methane formed can be minimized compared to the sum of all of the various long-chained products  increasing  increases the formation of long-chained hydrocarbons  the very long-chained hydrocarbons are waxes  which are solid at room temperature  therefore  for production of liquid transportation fuels it may be necessary to crack some of the fischertropsch products  in order to avoid this  some researchers have proposed using zeolites or other catalyst substrates with fixed sized pores that can restrict the formation of hydrocarbons longer than some characteristic size  usually n 10   this way they can drive the reaction so as to minimize methane formation without producing lots of long-chained hydrocarbons  such efforts have met with only limited success 
catalysts  
a variety of
can be used for the fischertropsch process  but the most common are the
    and  
can also be used  but tends to favor methane formation    
cobalt  
cobalt-based catalysts are highly active  although iron may be more suitable for certain applications  cobalt catalysts are more active for fischertropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas  natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio  so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts  iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass  synthesis gases derived from these hydrogen-poor feedstocks has a low-hydrogen-content and require the watergas shift reaction  unlike the other metals used for this process  co  ni  ru   which remain in the metallic state during synthesis  iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases  including various oxides and
during the reaction  control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles 
in addition to the active metal the catalysts typically contain a number of  promoters   including potassium and copper  group 1 alkali metals  including potassium  are a poison for cobalt catalysts but are promoters for iron catalysts  catalysts are supported on high-surface-area binders supports such as     or   promotors also have an important influence on activity  alkali metal oxides and copper are common promotors  but the formulation depends on the primary metal  iron vs cobalt  alkali oxides on cobalt catalysts generally cause activity to drop severely even with very low alkali loadings  c5 and co2 selectivity increase while methane and c2c4 selectivity decrease  in addition  the alkene to alkane ratio increases 
fischertropsch catalysts are sensitive to poisoning by sulfur-containing compounds  cobalt-based catalysts are more sensitive than for their iron counterparts 
iron  
fischertropsch iron catalysts need alkali promotion to attain high activity and stability  e g  0.5 wt  k

3 for structural promotion and maybe some manganese can be applied for selectivity control  e g  high olefinicity   the working catalyst is only obtained whenafter reduction with hydrogenin the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron  with iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued  one direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process  sasolsynthol process   due to the relatively high reaction temperature  approx  340c   the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions  the catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small  particle diameter 100m  and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation  thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite  plus promoters  after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate  for maximising the overall gasoline yield  c3 and c4 alkenes have been oligomerized at sasol  however  recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in  e g   polymerization processes is advantageous today  the second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature where most of the hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions  typically  such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions  a high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores  the main product fraction then is a paraffin wax  which is refined to marketable wax materials at sasol  however  it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel  thus  iron catalysts are very flexible 
ruthenium  
is most active working at the lowest reaction temperature  it produces the highest molecular weight hydrocarbons  polymethylene synthesis  pichler and buffleb performing thus the chain growth reaction in the cleanest mode  it acts as a fischer tropsch catalyst as the pure metal  without any promotors  thus providing the simplest catalytic system of fischer tropsch synthesis  where mechanistic conclusions should be the easieste g   much easier than with iron as the catalyst  like with nickel  the selectivity changes to mainly methane at elevated temperature  its high price and limited world resources exclude industrial application  systematic fischer tropsch studies with ruthenium catalysts should contribute substantially to the further exploration of the fundamentals of fischer tropsch synthesis  there is an interesting question to consider  what features have the metals nickel  iron  cobalt  and ruthenium in common to let themand only thembe fischertropsch catalysts  converting the co h2 mixture to aliphatic  long chain  hydrocarbons in a one step reaction  the term one step reaction means that reaction intermediates are not desorbed from the catalyst surface  in particular  it is amazing that the much carbided alkalized iron catalyst gives this reaction similarly as the just metallic ruthenium catalyst  it will be seen in the next section that the kinetic principle of selective inhibition might be the common feature which applies in spite of differences in catalyst composition  reaction intermediates  steps of reaction and corresponding kinetic schemes

facility in     such large facilities are susceptible to high capital costs  high operation and maintenance costs  the uncertain and volatile price of   and the involvement of potentially environmentally damaging processes  in particular  the use of natural gas as a feedstock becomes practical only with use of     i e   sources of natural gas far from major cities which are impractical to exploit with conventional gas pipelines and lng technology  otherwise  the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable  several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of so-called  
conventional ft reactors have been optimized for massive coal-to-liquids and gasliquid facilities such as shell s
facility  these slurry bed and fixed-bed reactors are much larger than the sizes needed for biofuel facilities or for smaller-scale natural-gas fields  the use of microchannel reactors  such as those developed by velocys  intensifies the reaction  scales down the size of the reaction hardware and overcomes the heat and mass transport problems associated with conventional ft technology 
inside the microchannels reactor allows for optimal temperature control  which maximizes catalyst activity and life  while no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation  indications show capital costs  operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional ft facilities
