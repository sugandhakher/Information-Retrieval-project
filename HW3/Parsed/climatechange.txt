climate change

climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of
patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time  i e   decades to millions of years   climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions  or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions  i e   more or fewer
events   climate change is caused by factors such as
processes  variations in
received by earth    and   certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change  often referred to as

the most general definition of climate change is a change in the statistical properties  principally its
and   of the climate system when considered over long periods of time  regardless of cause  accordingly  fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades  such as   do not represent climate change 
the term sometimes is used to refer specifically to climate change caused by human activity  as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of earth s natural processes  in this sense  especially in the context of   the term climate change has become synonymous with
  within scientific journals  global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing
levels affect 
climatic change versus climate change
in 1966  the
 wmo  proposed the term climatic change to encompass all forms of climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years  whether the cause was natural or anthropogenic  change was a given and climatic was used as an adjective to describe this kind of change  as opposed to political or economic change   when it was realized that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate  the term climate change replaced climatic change as the dominant term to reflect an anthropogenic cause  climate change was incorporated in the title of the
 ipcc  and the
 unfccc   climate change  used as a noun  became an issue rather than the technical description of changing weather 
causes
on the broadest scale  the rate at which energy is received from the
and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of earth  this energy is distributed around the globe by winds  ocean currents  and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different regions 
factors that can shape climate are called
or  forcing mechanisms   these include processes such as variations in   variations in the earth s orbit  variations in the
or reflectivity of the continents and oceans 
and
and changes in
concentrations  there are a variety of
that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing  some parts of the climate system  such as the oceans and ice caps  respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings  while others respond more quickly  there are also key
which when exceeded can produce rapid change 
forcing mechanisms can be either  internal  or  external   internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself  e g   the    external forcing mechanisms can be either natural  e g   changes in solar output  or anthropogenic  e g   increased emissions of greenhouse gases  
whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external  the response of the climate system might be fast  e g   a sudden cooling due to airborne
reflecting sunlight   slow  e g 
of warming ocean water   or a combination  e g   sudden loss of
in the arctic ocean as sea ice melts  followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water   therefore  the climate system can respond abruptly  but the full response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or even longer 
internal forcing mechanisms
scientists generally define the five components of earth s climate system to include      
 restricted to the surface soils  rocks  and sediments   and   natural changes in the climate system   internal forcings   result in internal  climate variability   examples include the type and distribution of species  and changes in ocean currents 
ocean variability

1925 to 2010
the ocean is a fundamental part of the climate system  some changes in it occurring at longer timescales than in the   as it has hundreds of times more mass and thus very high   with effects such as the ocean depths still lagging today in temperature adjustment from effects of the
of past centuries    
short-term fluctuations  years to a few decades  such as the   the   the   and the   represent climate variability rather than climate change  on longer time-scales  alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat by carrying out a very slow and extremely deep movement of water and the long-term redistribution of heat in the world s oceans

circulation  tens of millions of years ago  continental-plate movement formed a land-free gap around antarctica  allowing the formation of the   which keeps warm waters away from antarctica

orbital variations
main article 
slight variations in earth s orbit lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the earth s surface and how it is distributed across the globe  there is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine  but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution  the three types of orbital variations are variations in earth s   changes in   and
of earth s axis  combined together  these produce
which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to

notes that milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles 
followed temperature change  with a lag of some hundreds of years   and that as a feedback amplified temperature change  the depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature   on such scale   upon seawater temperature change  the solubility of co2 in the oceans changed  as well as other factors impacting air-sea co2 exchange 
solar output

and
isotopes  the period of extraordinarily few sunspots in the late 17th century was the

input to the earth  other sources include
energy from the earth s core  and heat from the decay of radioactive compounds  both long- and short-term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate 
  the sun emitted only 70  as much power as it does today  if the atmospheric composition had been the same as today  liquid water should not have existed on earth  however  there is evidence for the presence of water on the early earth  in the
and
eons  leading to what is known as the   hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere  with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist  over the following approximately 4 billion years  the energy output of the sun increased and atmospheric composition changed  the  oxygenation of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years ago was the most notable alteration  over the next five billion years  the sun s ultimate death as it becomes a

and
are considered to have been influential in triggering the little ice age  and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950  the cyclical nature of the sun s energy output is not yet fully understood  it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the sun as it ages and evolves  research indicates that solar variability has had effects including the
from 1645 to 1715   part of the little ice age from 1550 to 1850 a d  that was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward  some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming  and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects  solar variation  anthropogenic   etc   
interestingly  a 2010 study suggests  that the effects of solar variability on temperature throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectations 
in an aug 2011 press release 
announced the publication in the
journal the initial results from its
experiment  the results indicate that ionisation from cosmic rays significantly enhances aerosol formation in the presence of sulfuric acid and water  but in the lower atmosphere where ammonia is also required  this is insufficient to account for aerosol formation and additional trace vapours must be involved  the next step is to find more about these trace vapours  including whether they are of natural or human origin

volcanism
in atmospheric temperature from 1979 to 2010  determined by
satellites  effects appear from
released by major volcanic eruptions   and   
is a separate event  from ocean variability 
the
considered to be large enough to affect the earth s climate on a scale of more than 1 year are the ones that inject over 100,000
of
into the   this is due to the optical properties of so2 and sulfate aerosols  which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation  creating a global layer of
haze  on average  such eruptions occur several times per century  and cause cooling  by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the earth s surface  for a period of a few years 
the eruption of
in 1991  the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century  affected the climate substantially  subsequently global temperatures decreased by about 0.5c  0.9f  for up to three years  thus  the cooling over large parts of the earth reduced surface temperatures in 1991-93  the equivalent to a reduction in net radiation of 4 watts per square meter  the
eruption in 1815 caused the   much larger eruptions  known as   occur only a few times every fifty - hundred million years - through   and caused in earth past global warming and  
small eruptions  with injections of less than 0.1 mt of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere  impact the atmosphere only subtly  as temperature changes are comparable with natural variability  however  because smaller eruptions occur at a much higher frequency  they too have a significant impact on earth s atmosphere 
maps current and future trends in volcanic activities  and tries to develop early warning systems  in
the aim is to study the physical mechanisms and feedbacks of volcanic forcing 
volcanoes are also part of the extended   over very long  geological  time periods  they release carbon dioxide from the earth s crust and mantle  counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological   the
estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities  which generate 100300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes  a review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide  including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges  volcanic arcs  and hot spot volcanoes  are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days of human caused output  the annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by   the most recent of which was the
in indonesia 74,000 years ago 
although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere  which itself is part of the climate system  the ipcc explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agent 
plate tectonics
main article 
over the course of millions of years  the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography  this can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation 
the position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation  the locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe  and therefore  in determining global climate  a recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the
about 5 million years ago  which shut off direct mixing between the
and
oceans  this strongly affected the
of what is now the
and may have led to northern hemisphere ice cover  during the
period  about 300 to 360 million years ago  plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased   geologic evidence points to a  megamonsoonal  circulation pattern during the time of the
  and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons 
the size of continents is also important  because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature  yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland  a larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or  
human influences
increase in atmospheric co2 levels
main article 
in the context of climate variation  anthropogenic factors are human activities which affect the climate  the
is  that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities   and it  is largely irreversible  
science has made enormous inroads in understanding climate change and its causes  and is beginning to help develop a strong understanding of current and potential impacts that will affect people today and in coming decades  this understanding is crucial because it allows decision makers to place climate change in the context of other large challenges facing the nation and the world  there are still some uncertainties  and there always will be in understanding a complex system like earths climate  nevertheless  there is a strong  credible body of evidence  based on multiple lines of research  documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities  while much remains to be learned  the core phenomenon  scientific questions  and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations 
  advancing the science of climate change
of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in co2 levels due to emissions from
combustion  followed by
 particulate matter in the atmosphere  and the co2 released by
manufacture  other factors  including land use    animal agriculture and   are also of concern in the roles they play both separately and in conjunction with other factors in affecting climate    and measures of climate variables

decline in thickness of glaciers worldwide over the past half-century
glaciers
are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change  their size is determined by a
between snow input and melt output  as temperatures warm  glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt  the converse is also true 
glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings  variability in temperature  precipitation  and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season  therefore  one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate 
a world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s  initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites  this compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000km2  and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000km2  the world glacier monitoring service collects data annually on
and   from this data  glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly  with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s  stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s  and again retreating from the mid-1980s to present 
the most significant climate processes since the middle to late
 approximately 3 million years ago  are the glacial and
cycles  the present interglacial period  the   has lasted about 11,700 years  shaped by   responses such as the rise and fall of
ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate  other changes  including

horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained

the decline in arctic sea ice  both in extent and thickness  over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change  sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface  it covers millions of square miles in the polar regions  varying with the seasons  in the   some sea ice remains year after year  whereas almost all
or antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually  satellite observations show that arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.3 percent per decade  relative to the 1981 to 2010 average 
this video summarizes how climate change  associated with increased carbon dioxide levels  has affected plant growth 
vegetation
a change in the type  distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate  some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth  resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne co2  a gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times  driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms  conversely  cold will cause plant bio-cycles to lag  larger  faster or more radical changes  however  may result in vegetation stress  rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances  an example of this occurred during the

pollen analysis

and
past precipitation can be estimated in the modern era with the global network of precipitation gauges  surface coverage over oceans and remote areas is relatively sparse  but  reducing reliance on   satellite clouds and precipitation data has been available since the 1970s  quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments  ice cores  cave stalagmites  and tree rings  in july 2016 scientists published evidence of increased cloud cover over polar regions  as predicted by climate models 
climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation  for instance  during the
of 18,000 years ago  thermal-driven
from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low  causing large areas of extreme desert  including
 cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation   in contrast  the world s climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm
of 8000 years ago 
estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2  over the course of the 20th century  though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen  complicated by
and other oscillations  including greater global land cloud cover precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century overall  similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived 
dendroclimatology
