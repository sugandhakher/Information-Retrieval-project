environmental design is the process of addressing surrounding environmental parameters when devising plans  programs  policies  buildings  or products  classical prudent design may have always considered environmental factors  however  the environmental movement beginning in the 1940s has made the concept more explicit 
environmental design can also refer to the applied arts and sciences dealing with creating the human-designed environment  these fields include         and   environmental design can also encompass interdisciplinary areas such as
and
design  in terms of a larger scope  environmental design has implications for the industrial design of products  innovative automobiles  wind-electricity generators  solar-electric equipment  and other kinds of equipment could serve as examples  currently  the term has expanded to apply to ecological and sustainability issues

history

the first traceable concepts of environmental designs focused primarily on solar heating  which began in
around 500 bce  at the time  most of greece had exhausted its supply of wood for fuel  leading architects to design houses that would capture the solar energy of the sun  the greeks understood that the position of the sun varies throughout the year  for a latitude of 40 degrees in summer the sun is high in the south  at an angle of 70 degrees at the zenith  while in winter  the sun travels a lower trajectory  with a zenith of 26 degrees  greek houses were built with south-facing faades which received little to no sun in the summer but would receive full sun in the winter  warming the house  additionally  the southern orientation also protected the house from the colder northern winds  this clever arrangement of buildings influenced the use of the
of ancient cities  with the north-south orientation of the houses  the streets of greek cities mainly ran east-west 
the practice of solar architecture continued with the   who similarly had deforested much of their native
by the first century bce  the roman heliocaminus  literally  solar furnace   functioned with the same aspects of the earlier greek houses  the numerous public baths were oriented to the south  roman architects added glass to windows to allow for the passage of light and to conserve interior heat as it could not escape  the romans also used greenhouses to grow crops all year long and to cultivate the exotic plants coming from the far corners of the empire  pliny the elder wrote of greenhouses that supplied the kitchen of the emperor tiberius during the year 
along with the solar orientation of buildings and the use of glass as a solar heat collector  the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy  the greeks  romans and chinese developed curved mirrors that could concentrate the sun s rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds  the solar reflectors were often made of polished silver  copper or brass 
early roots of modern environmental design began in the late 19th century with writer designer   who rejected the use of industrialized materials and processes in wallpaper  fabrics and books his studio produced  he and others  such as
felt that the industrial revolution would lead to harm done to nature and workers 
the narrative of brian danitz and chris zelov s documentary film ecological design  inventing the future asserts that in the decades after world war ii   the world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry   from the middle of the twentieth century  thinkers like
have acted as catalysts for a broadening and deepening of the concerns of environmental designers  nowadays     
and       and ecologically
and waste systems are recognized considerations or options and may each find application 
by integrating renewable energy sources such as     and even
into structures  it is possible to create
buildings  where energy consumption is self-generating and non-polluting  it is also possible to construct  energy-plus buildings  which generate more energy than they consume  and the excess could then be sold to the grid  in the   the
green building rating system rates structures on their environmental sustainability 
examples  
examples of the environmental design process include use of roadway noise computer models in design of noise barriers and use of roadway air dispersion models in analyzing and designing urban highways 
designers consciously working within this more recent framework of philosophy and practice seek a blending of nature and technology  regarding ecology as the basis for design  some believe that strategies of conservation  stewardship  and regeneration can be applied at all levels of scale from the individual building to the community  with benefit to the human individual and local and planetary ecosystems 
specific examples of large scale environmental design projects include
