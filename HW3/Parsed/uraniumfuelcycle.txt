the nuclear fuel cycle  also called nuclear fuel chain  is the progression of
through a series of differing stages  it consists of steps in the front end  which are the preparation of the fuel  steps in the service period in which the fuel is used during reactor operation  and steps in the back end  which are necessary to safely manage  contain  and either
or dispose of   if spent fuel is not reprocessed  the fuel cycle is referred to as an open fuel cycle  or a once-through fuel cycle   if the spent fuel is reprocessed  it is referred to as a closed fuel cycle

and   most nuclear reactors use a

of the neutrons and increase the probability that
will occur  this allows reactors to use material with far lower concentration of

are the most effective moderators  because they slow the neutrons through collisions without absorbing them

 lwr  uses water in the form that occurs in nature  and require fuel that is enriched in fissile isotopes  typically uranium
to 35  in the less common isotope   the only fissile isotope that is found in significant quantity in nature  one alternative to this low-enriched uranium  leu  fuel are
 mox  fuels produced by blending plutonium with natural or depleted uranium  and these fuels provide an avenue to utilize surplus
plutonium  another type of mox fuel involves mixing leu with   which generates the fissile isotope   both plutonium and u-233 are produced from the absorption of neutrons by
in a reactor  in particular the common uranium isotope
and   respectively  and can be separated from spent uranium and thorium fuels in  
some reactors do not use moderators to slow the neutrons  like nuclear weapons  which also use unmoderated or  fast  neutrons  these
require much higher concentrations of fissile isotopes in order to sustain a chain reaction  they are also capable of
fissile isotopes from fertile materials  a
is one that generates more fissile material in this way than it consumes 
during the nuclear reaction inside a reactor  the fissile isotopes in nuclear fuel are consumed  producing more and more   most of which are considered   the buildup of fission products and consumption of fissile isotopes eventually stop the nuclear reaction  causing the fuel to become a   when 3  enriched leu fuel is used  the spent fuel typically consists of roughly 1  u-235  95  u-238  1  plutonium and 3  fission products  spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste is extremely hazardous  although nuclear reactors produce relatively small volumes of waste compared to other power plants because of the high energy density of nuclear fuel  safe management of these byproducts of nuclear power  including their storage and disposal  is a difficult problem for any country using nuclear power

exploration  
a deposit of uranium  such as   discovered by geophysical techniques  is evaluated and sampled to determine the amounts of uranium materials that are extractable at specified costs from the deposit  uranium reserves are the amounts of ore that are estimated to be recoverable at stated costs  uranium in nature consists primarily of two isotopes  u-238 and u-235  the numbers refer to the atomic
for each   or the number of
and
in the   naturally occurring uranium consists of approximately 99.28  u-238 and 0.71  u-235  the atomic nucleus of u-235 will nearly always fission when struck by a   and the isotope is therefore said to be a    isotope  the nucleus of a u-238 atom on the other hand  rather than undergoing fission when struck by a free neutron  will nearly always absorb the neutron and yield an atom of the isotope u-239  this isotope then undergoes natural radioactive decay to yield pu-239  which  like u-235  is a fissile isotope  the atoms of u-238 are said to be fertile  because  through neutron irradiation in the core  some eventually yield atoms of fissile pu-239 
mining  
main article 
uranium ore can be extracted through conventional mining in open pit and underground methods similar to those used for mining other metals 
methods also are used to mine uranium in the   in this technology  uranium is leached from the in-place ore through an array of regularly spaced wells and is then recovered from the leach solution at a surface plant  uranium ores in the united states typically range from about 0.05 to 0.3  uranium oxide  u3o8   some uranium deposits developed in other countries are of higher grade and are also larger than deposits mined in the united states  uranium is also present in very low-grade amounts  50 to 200 parts per million  in some domestic -bearing deposits of marine origin  because very large quantities of phosphate-bearing rock are mined for the production of wet-process
used in high analysis
and other phosphate chemicals  at some phosphate processing plants the uranium  although present in very low concentrations  can be economically recovered from the process stream 
milling  
mined uranium ores normally are processed by
the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching  the milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium      which is sold on the uranium market as u3o8 
uranium conversion  
milled uranium oxide  u3o8  must be converted to   uf6  which is the form required by most commercial uranium enrichment facilities currently in use  a solid at room temperature  uranium hexafluoride can be changed to a gaseous form at moderately higher temperature of 57c  134f   the uranium hexafluoride conversion product contains only natural  not enriched  uranium 
 u3o8  is also converted directly to
grade
 uo2  for use in reactors not requiring enriched fuel  such as   the volumes of material converted directly to uo2 are typically quite small compared to the amounts converted to uf6 
enrichment  
main article 
nuclear fuel cycle begins when
is mined  enriched and manufactured to nuclear fuel  1  which is delivered to a   after usage in the power plant the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant  if fuel is recycled   2  or to a final repository  if no recycling is done   3  for geological disposition  in
95  of spent fuel can be recycled to be returned to usage in a
 4  
the concentration of the fissionable isotope  u-235  0.71  in natural uranium  is less than that required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction in
cores  natural uf6 thus must be enriched in the fissionable isotope for it to be used as nuclear fuel  the different levels of enrichment required for a particular nuclear fuel application are specified by the customer  light-water reactor fuel normally is enriched to 3.5  u-235  but uranium enriched to lower concentrations is also required  enrichment is accomplished using one or more methods of  
and
are the commonly used uranium enrichment technologies  but new enrichment technologies are currently being developed 
the bulk  96   of the byproduct from enrichment is
 du   which can be used for    
and   still  there are vast quantities of depleted uranium in storage  the
alone has 470,000   about 95  of depleted uranium is stored as
 uf6  
fabrication  
main article 
for use as nuclear fuel  enriched uranium hexafluoride is converted into
 uo2  powder that is then processed into pellet form  the pellets are then fired in a high temperature
to create hard 
pellets of   the cylindrical pellets then undergo a grinding process to achieve a uniform pellet size  the pellets are stacked  according to each  s design specifications  into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal   the tubes are sealed to contain the fuel pellets  these tubes are called fuel rods  the finished fuel rods are grouped in special fuel assemblies that are then used to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor 
the alloy used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor 
was used in the past  but most reactors now use a   for the most common types of reactors 
 bwr  and
 pwr   the tubes are assembled into bundles with the tubes spaced precise distances apart  these bundles are then given a unique identification number  which enables them to be tracked from manufacture through use and into disposal 
service period  
transport of radioactive materials  
is an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle  there are nuclear power reactors in operation in several countries but uranium mining is viable in only a few areas  also  in the course of over forty years of operation by the nuclear industry  a number of specialized facilities have been developed in various locations around the world to provide fuel cycle services and there is a need to transport nuclear materials to and from these facilities  most transports of
material occur between different stages of the cycle  but occasionally a material may be transported between similar facilities  with some exceptions  nuclear fuel cycle materials are transported in solid form  the exception being
 uf6  which is considered a gas  most of the material used in nuclear fuel is transported several times during the cycle  transports are frequently international  and are often over large distances  nuclear materials are generally transported by specialized transport companies 
since nuclear materials are   it is important to ensure that radiation exposure of both those involved in the transport of such materials and the general public along transport routes is limited  packaging for nuclear materials includes  where appropriate 
to reduce potential radiation exposures  in the case of some materials  such as fresh uranium fuel assemblies  the radiation levels are negligible and no shielding is required  other materials  such as spent fuel and high-level waste  are highly radioactive and require special handling  to limit the risk in transporting highly radioactive materials  containers known as
are used which are designed to maintain integrity under normal transportation conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions 
in-core fuel management  
a
is composed of a few hundred  assemblies   arranged in a regular array of cells  each cell being formed by a fuel or control rod surrounded  in most designs  by a
and   which is water in most reactors 
because of the
process that consumes the fuels  the old fuel rods must be changed periodically to fresh ones  this period is called a cycle   however  only a part of the assemblies  typically one-third  are removed since the fuel depletion is not spatially uniform  furthermore  it is not a good policy  for efficiency reasons  to put the new assemblies exactly at the location of the removed ones  even bundles of the same age may have different burn-up levels  which depends on their previous positions in the core  thus the available bundles must be arranged in such a way that the yield is maximized  while safety limitations and operational constraints are satisfied  consequently  reactor operators are faced with the so-called optimal fuel reloading problem  which consists in optimizing the rearrangement of all the assemblies  the old and fresh ones  while still maximizing the reactivity of the reactor core so as to maximise fuel burn-up and minimise fuel-cycle costs 
this is a
problem  and computationally infeasible by current
methods  due to the huge number of
and the complexity of each computation  many
have been proposed for solving it and many commercial
packages have been written to support fuel management  this is an ongoing issue in reactor operations as no definitive solution to this problem has been found  operators use a combination of
and
techniques to manage this problem 
the study of used fuel  
main article 
used nuclear fuel is studied in   where used fuel is examined to know more about the processes that occur in fuel during use  and how these might alter the outcome of an accident  for example  during normal use  the fuel expands due to thermal expansion  which can cause cracking  most
is uranium dioxide  which is a
solid with a structure similar to that of   in used fuel the solid state structure of most of the solid remains the same as that of pure cubic uranium dioxide  simfuel is the name given to the simulated spent fuel which is made by mixing finely ground metal oxides  grinding as a slurry  spray drying it before heating in hydrogen argon to 1700 oc  in simfuel  4.1  of the volume of the solid was in the form of metal
which are made of    
and   most of these metal particles are of the  phase    of mo-ru-rh-pd alloy  while smaller amounts of the     and     phases of these metals were found in the simfuel  also present within the simfuel was a cubic
phase which is a
 baxsr1-xzro3  
the solid state structure of uranium dioxide  the oxygen atoms are in green and the uranium atoms in red
uranium dioxide is very insoluble in water  but after oxidation it can be converted to uranium trioxide or another uranium vi  compound which is much more soluble  uranium dioxide  uo2  can be oxidised to an oxygen rich hyperstoichiometric oxide  uo2 x  which can be further oxidised to u4o9  u3o7  u3o8 and uo3.2h2o 
because used fuel contains alpha emitters  plutonium and the    the effect of adding an alpha emitter  238pu  to uranium dioxide on the leaching rate of the oxide has been investigated  for the crushed oxide  adding 238pu tended to increase the rate of leaching  but the difference in the leaching rate between 0.1 and 10  238pu was very small 
the concentration of
in the water which is in contact with the used fuel has a considerable effect on the rate of corrosion  because  vi  forms soluble anionic carbonate complexes such as  uo2 co3 2 2 and  uo2 co3 3 4  when carbonate ions are absent  and the water is not strongly acidic  the hexavalent uranium compounds which form on oxidation of
often form insoluble hydrated
phases 
by   using uranium metal and an   gas mixture  thin films of uranium dioxide can be deposited upon gold surfaces  these gold surfaces modified with uranium dioxide have been used for both
and
experiments  and these offer an insight into the likely leaching behaviour of uranium dioxide 
fuel cladding interactions  
the study of the nuclear fuel cycle includes the study of the behaviour of nuclear materials both under normal conditions and under accident conditions  for example  there has been much work on how
based fuel interacts with the
alloy tubing used to cover it  during use  the fuel swells due to
and then starts to react with the surface of the zirconium alloy  forming a new layer which contains both fuel and zirconium  from the cladding   then  on the fuel side of this mixed layer  there is a layer of fuel which has a higher
to
ratio than most of the fuel  this is because
isotopes are formed as
that diffuse out of the lattice of the fuel into voids such as the narrow gap between the fuel and the cladding  after diffusing into these voids  it decays to caesium isotopes  because of the thermal gradient which exists in the fuel during use  the volatile fission products tend to be driven from the centre of the pellet to the rim area  below is a graph of the temperature of uranium metal  uranium nitride and
as a function of distance from the centre of a 20mm diameter pellet with a rim temperature of 200 oc  the uranium dioxide  because of its poor thermal conductivity  will overheat at the centre of the pellet  while the other more thermally conductive forms of uranium remain below their melting points 
temperature profile for a 20mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 1 kw per cubic meter  the fuels other than uranium dioxide are not compromised 
normal and abnormal conditions  
the nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas  one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or  more rarely  an accident is occurring 
the releases of radioactivity from normal operations are the small planned releases from uranium ore processing  enrichment  power reactors  reprocessing plants and waste stores  these can be in a different chemical physical form to the releases which could occur under accident conditions  in addition the isotope signature of a hypothetical accident may be very different from that of a planned normal operational discharge of radioactivity to the environment 
just because a radioisotope is released it does not mean it will enter a human and then cause harm  for instance  the migration of radioactivity can be altered by the binding of the radioisotope to the surfaces of soil particles  for example 
 cs  binds tightly to clay minerals such as
and   hence it remains in the upper layers of soil where it can be accessed by plants with shallow roots  such as grass   hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of 137cs which can be transferred to humans through the food chain  but 137cs is not able to migrate quickly through most soils and thus is unlikely to contaminate
water  colloids of soil minerals can migrate through soil so simple binding of a metal to the surfaces of soil particles does not fix the metal totally 
according to ji hla s   the distribution coefficient kd is the ratio of the soil s radioactivity  bq g1  to that of the soil water  bq ml1   if the radioisotope is tightly bound to the minerals in the soil  then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and
growing on the soil 
kd   1000
kd   10000 to 100000
kd   80 to 150
kd   0.007 to 50
one of the best countermeasures in dairy farming against 137cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil  this has the effect of putting the 137cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass  hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered  also after a nuclear war or serious accident  the removal of top few cm of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the long-term gamma dose to humans due to 137cs  as the gamma photons will be attenuated by their passage through the soil 
even after the radioactive element arrives at the roots of the plant  the metal may be rejected by the biochemistry of the plant  the details of the uptake of 90sr and 137cs into
grown under
conditions has been reported  the caesium was found in the leaf veins  in the stem and in the
leaves  it was found that 12  of the caesium entered the plant  and 20  of the strontium  this paper also reports details of the effect of  
and
ions on the uptake of the radioisotopes 
in
farming  an important countermeasure against 137cs is to feed animals a small amount of   this
potassium
compound acts as an   the cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of prussian blue per day  the prussian blue reduces the
 different from the   of the caesium  the physical or nuclear half-life of 137cs is about 30 years  this is a constant which can not be changed but the biological half-life is not a constant  it will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed  caesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months  an added advantage of the prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the
is in a form which is not available to plants  hence it prevents the caesium from being recycled  the form of prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade  attempts to use the
grade used in
have not been successful  note that a good   source of data on the subject of caesium in
fallout exists at
 ukrainian research institute for agricultural radiology  
release of radioactivity from fuel during normal use and accidents  
the iaea assume that under normal operation the coolant of a water-cooled reactor will contain some radioactivity but during a reactor accident the coolant radioactivity level may rise  the iaea states that under a series of different conditions different amounts of the core inventory can be released from the fuel  the four conditions the iaea consider are normal operation  a spike in coolant activity due to a sudden shutdown loss of pressure  core remains covered with water   a cladding failure resulting in the release of the activity in the fuel cladding gap  this could be due to the fuel being uncovered by the loss of water for 1530 minutes where the cladding reached a temperature of 650-1250 oc  or a melting of the core  the fuel will have to be uncovered for at least 30 minutes  and the cladding would reach a temperature in excess of 1650 oc  
based upon the assumption that a pressurized water reactor contains 300 tons of   and that the activity of the fuel of a 1 gwe reactor is as the iaea predicts  then the coolant activity after an accident such as the
 where a core is uncovered and then recovered with water  can be predicted   
releases from reprocessing under normal conditions  
it is normal to allow used fuel to stand after the irradiation to allow the short-lived and radiotoxic
isotopes to decay away  in one experiment in the usa  fresh fuel which had not been allowed to decay was reprocessed  the
  to investigate the effects of a large iodine release from the reprocessing of short cooled fuel  it is normal in reprocessing plants to scrub the off gases from the dissolver to prevent the emission of iodine  in addition to the emission of iodine the
and
are released from the fuel when it is dissolved  it has been proposed that by voloxidation  heating the fuel in a furnace under oxidizing conditions  the majority of the tritium can be recovered from the fuel 
a paper was written on the radioactivity in
found in the   these were found by gamma spectroscopy to contain 141ce  144ce  103ru  106ru  137cs  95zr and 95nb  additionally  a zinc activation product  65zn  was found  which is thought to be due to the corrosion of
fuel cladding in   it is likely that the modern releases of all these isotopes from windscale is smaller 
on-load reactors  
some reactor designs  such as
or   can be refueled without being shut down  this is achieved through the use of many small pressure tubes to contain the fuel and coolant  as opposed to one large pressure vessel as in
 pwr  or
 bwr  designs  each tube can be individually isolated and refueled by an operator-controlled fueling machine  typically at a rate of up to 8 channels per day out of roughly 400 in candu reactors  on-load refueling allows for the optimal fuel reloading problem to be dealt with continuously  leading to more efficient use of fuel  this increase in efficiency is partially offset by the added complexity of having hundreds of pressure tubes and the fueling machines to service them 
interim storage  
after its operating cycle  the reactor is shut down for refueling  the fuel discharged at that time  spent fuel  is stored either at the reactor site  commonly in a   or potentially in a common facility away from reactor sites  if on-site pool storage capacity is exceeded  it may be desirable to store the now cooled aged fuel in modular dry storage facilities known as independent spent fuel storage installations  isfsi  at the reactor site or at a facility away from the site  the spent fuel rods are usually stored in water or boric acid  which provides both cooling  the spent fuel continues to generate
as a result of residual radioactive decay  and shielding to protect the environment from residual   although after at least a year of cooling they may be moved to  
transportation

a current concern in the nuclear power field is the safe disposal and isolation of either

fuel cycles  
although the most common terminology is fuel cycle  some argue that the term fuel chain is more accurate  because the spent fuel is never fully recycled  spent fuel includes   which generally must be treated as   as well as uranium  plutonium  and other transuranic elements  where plutonium is recycled  it is normally reused once in light water reactors  although fast reactors could lead to more complete recycling of plutonium 
once-through nuclear fuel cycle  
a once through  or open  fuel cycle
not a cycle per se  fuel is used once and then sent to storage without further processing save additional packaging to provide for better isolation from the   this method is favored by six countries  the        
and   some countries  notably finland  sweden and canada  have designed repositories to permit future recovery of the material should the need arise  while others plan for permanent sequestration in a

services offered by
and   here  the       and
are separated from the reactor-grade   which can then be fabricated into   because the proportion of the non- -
rises with each pass through the cycle  there are currently no plans to reuse plutonium from used mox fuel for a third pass in a   however  if
become available  they may be able to burn these  or almost any other
 
minor actinides recycling  
it has been proposed that in addition to the use of plutonium  the
could be used in a critical power reactor  tests are already being conducted in which
is being used as a fuel 
a number of reactor designs  like the   have been designed for this rather different fuel cycle  in principle  it should be possible to derive energy from the fission of any actinide nucleus  with a careful reactor design  all the actinides in the fuel can be consumed  leaving only lighter elements with short   whereas this has been done in prototype plants  no such reactor has ever been operated on a large scale  and the first plants with full actinide recovery are expected to be ready for commercial deployment in 2015 at the earliest 
it so happens that the
of many actinides decreases with increasing neutron energy  but the ratio of fission to simple activation    changes in favour of fission as the neutron energy increases  thus with a sufficiently high neutron energy  it should be possible to destroy even curium without the generation of the transcurium metals  this could be very desirable as it would make it significantly easier to reprocess and handle the actinide fuel 
one promising alternative from this perspective is an
    here a beam of either
 united states and european designs  or
 japanese design  is directed into a target  in the case of protons  very fast neutrons will spall off the target  while in the case of the electrons  very high energy
will be generated  these high-energy neutrons and photons will then be able to cause the fission of the heavy actinides 
such reactors compare very well to other neutron sources in terms of neutron energy

as an alternative  the curium-244  with a half-life of 18 years  could be left to decay into plutonium-240 before being used in fuel in a fast reactor 
a pair of fuel cycles in which uranium and plutonium are kept separate from the minor actinides  the minor actinide cycle is kept within the green box 
fuel or targets for this actinide transmutation  
to date the nature of the fuel  targets  for actinide transformation has not been chosen 
if actinides are transmuted in a
it is likely that the fuel will have to be able to tolerate more thermal cycles than conventional fuel  an accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor is unlikely to be able to maintain a constant operation period for equally long times as a critical reactor  and each time the accelerator stops then the fuel will cool down 
on the other hand  if actinides are destroyed using a fast reactor  such as an   then the fuel will most likely not be exposed to many more thermal cycles than in a normal power station 
depending on the matrix the process can generate more transuranics from the matrix  this could either be viewed as good  generate more fuel  or can be viewed as bad  generation of more radiotoxic    a series of different matrices exists which can control this production of heavy actinides 
fissile nuclei  like uranium-235  plutonium-239 and uranium-233 respond well to
and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable  and this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor  as a consequence it is important that the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high  as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely  in contrast  the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator  and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all  in such a system it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that doesn t produce additional long-lived isotopes 
actinides in an inert matrix  
the actinides will be mixed with a metal which will not form more actinides  for instance an
of actinides in a solid such as
could be used 
actinides in a thorium matrix  
will on neutron bombardment form   u-233 is fissile  and has a larger fission cross section than both u-235 and u-238  and thus it is far less likely to produce higher actinides through neutron capture 
actinides in a uranium matrix  
if the actinides are incorporated into a uranium-metal or uranium-oxide matrix  then the neutron capture of u-238 is likely to generate new   an advantage of mixing the actinides with uranium and plutonium is that the large fission cross sections of u-235 and pu-239 for the less energetic
could make the reaction stable enough to be carried out in a critical   which is likely to be both cheaper and simpler than an accelerator driven system 
mixed matrix  
it is also possible to create a matrix made from a mix of the above-mentioned materials  this is most commonly done in fast reactors where one may wish to keep the breeding ratio of new fuel high enough to keep powering the reactor  but still low enough that the generated actinides can be safely destroyed without transporting them to another site  one way to do this is to use fuel where actinides and uranium is mixed with inert zirconium  producing fuel elements with the desired properties 
thorium cycle

after starting the reactor with existing u-233 or some other
such as
or   a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient than that with u-238 and plutonium can be created  the th-232 absorbs a neutron to become th-233 which quickly decays to -233  protactinium-233 in turn decays with a half-life of 27 days to u-233  in some
designs  the pa-233 is extracted and protected from neutrons  which could transform it to pa-234 and then to    until it has decayed to u-233  this is done in order to improve the

is at least 4-5 times more abundant in nature than all of uranium isotopes combined  thorium is fairly evenly spread around earth with a lot of countries having huge supplies of it  preparation of thorium fuel does not require difficult
and expensive enrichment processes  the thorium fuel cycle creates mainly uranium-233 contaminated with
which makes it harder to use in a normal  pre-assembled nuclear weapon which is stable over long periods of time  unfortunately drawbacks are much lower for immediate use weapons or where final assembly occurs just prior to usage time   elimination of at least the
portion of the nuclear waste problem is possible in
and other breeder reactor designs 
one of the earliest efforts to use a thorium fuel cycle took place at
in the 1960s  an experimental reactor was built based on
technology to study the feasibility of such an approach  using
kept hot enough to be liquid  thus eliminating the need for fabricating fuel elements  this effort culminated in the
that used 232th as the fertile material and 233u as the fissile fuel  due to a lack of funding  the msr program was discontinued in 1976 
current industrial activity  
currently the only isotopes used as nuclear fuel are
 u-235  
 u-238  and   although the proposed thorium fuel cycle has advantages  some modern reactors  with minor modifications  can use   thorium is approximately three times more abundant in the
than uranium  and 550 times more abundant than uranium-235   however  there has been little exploration for thorium resources  and thus the
is small 
is more plentiful than
in some countries  notably  
and graphite-moderated reactors can use   but the vast majority of the world s reactors require   in which the ratio of u-235 to u-238 is increased  in civilian reactors the enrichment is increased to as much as 5  u-235 and 95  u-238  but in
there is as much as 93  u-235
