this article is about technological innovations related to clean coal  for clean coal as a general concept  see  
clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the   when coal is used as a fuel source  the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include
 so2  
 nox  
 co2   mercury  and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used  these emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health  contributing to acid rain  lung cancer and cardiovascular disease  as a result  clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere  some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing
and impurities from the coal

gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency 
technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the
and dewatering lower rank coals    to improve the   and thus the efficiency of the conversion into   figures from the united states environmental protection agency show that these technologies have made todays coal-based generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced 
clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal  historically  the primary focus was on so2 and nox  the most important gases in causation of   and particulates which cause visible air pollution and   concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery  potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage  and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter

technology  
several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept 
pre-combustion capture - this involves
of a feedstock  such as coal  to form   which may be
to produce a h2 and co2-  from which the co2 can be efficiently captured and separated  transported  and ultimately sequestered  this technology is usually associated with
process configurations 
post-combustion capture - this refers to capture of co2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes 
- fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated
and oxygen  rather than in air  which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient  low-cost co2 capture 
the   a 582
-based power plant  will use pre-combustion capture of co2 to capture 65  of the co2 the plant produces  which will be utilized geologically sequestered in
operations 
the saskatchewan government s
will use post-combustion  amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90  of the co2 emitted by unit 3 of the power plant  this co2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the weyburn oil fields 
an oxyfuel ccs power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the co2 so that it may be stored or sequestered
an early example of a coal-based plant using  oxy-fuel  carbon-capture technology is swedish company s
located in     built by german firm   which went on-line in september 2008  the facility captures co2 and acid rain producing pollutants  separates them  and compresses the co2 into a liquid  plans are to inject the co2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations  vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for co2 reduction in the atmosphere  but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical 
other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress 
has retrofitted a 30-mwth existing pc-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode  in ciuden  spain  endesa has a newly built 30-mwth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion  cfbc  technology  babcock-thermoenergy s zero emission boiler system  zebs  is oxy-combustion-based  this system features near 100  carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions 
other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that
low-rank coals  low-rank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne  this causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output  reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent   
the uk government s is working towards a clean energy future and supports clean coal projects across the country  in august 2010  uk-based company
announced a clean coal project with 90  carbon capture to be put forward to decc  this would help the uk raise its profile amongst green leaders across the world  this proposed project 
and processes it to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide  the hydrogen is then used as an emissions-free fuel to run an
whilst the carbon dioxide is captured  this uk project could provide a world-leading template for clean coal with ccs globally 
demonstration projects in the united states  
in the late 1980s and early 1990s  the u s  department of energy  doe  began conducting a joint program with the industry and state agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use  the program  called the clean coal technology   clean coal power initiative  ccpi   has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation  the
has administered three rounds of ccpi funding and the following projects were selected during each round 
round 1 ccpi projects
advanced multi-product coal utilization by-product processing plant
demonstration of integrated optimization software at the baldwin energy complex
gilberton coal-to-clean fuels and power co-production project
increasing power plant efficiency  lignite fuel enhancement
toxecon retrofit for mercury and multi-pollutant control on three 90-mw coal-fired boilers
western greenbrier co-production demonstration project
commercial demonstration of the airborne process
integration of advanced emission controls to produce next-generation circulating fluid bed coal generating unit
round 2 ccpi projects
airborne processtm commercial scale demonstration program
demonstration of a coal-based transport gasifier
mercury species and multi-pollutant control project
mesaba energy project
round 3 ccpi projects
project
antelope valley station post-combustion co2 project

these programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants  this portfolio has positioned the u s  as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for sox  nox and mercury  and more recently for carbon capture  consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands  leading to widespread  global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  the doe continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships  a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the carbon sequestration core program  a ccs research and development program 
according to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the u s  department of energy  clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends  technological innovation introduced through the cct program now provides consumers cost-effective  clean  coal-based energy

further information 
according to
  the burning of coal  a   is a major contributor to    see the un    as 25.5  of the world s electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation  see    reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the
will require modifications to how coal is utilized 
coal  which is primarily used for the generation of electricity  is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the usa  the public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation  the coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming more than  50 billion towards the development and deployment of  traditional  clean coal technologies over the past 30 years  and promising  500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development 
some in the coal industry   and the u s  department of energy   refer to
 ccs  as the latest in  clean coal  technologies  the  clean coal  terminology is generally not endorsed by professionals in ccs  and is actively opposed by environmental organizations that favor ccs    ccs is a means to capture carbon dioxide from any source  compress it to a dense liquid-like state  and inject and permanently store it underground  currently  there are more than 80 carbon capture and sequestration projects underway in the united states  all components of ccs technology have been used for decades in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications  commercial-scale ccs is currently being tested in the u s  and other countries    proposed ccs sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards  which could include leakage of sequestered co2 to the atmosphere  induced geological instability  or contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies 
supporters   of clean coal use the great plains synfuels plant to support the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration  carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery  supporters   admit that carbon sequestration is expensive
