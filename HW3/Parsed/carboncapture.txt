carbon capture and storage  ccs   or carbon capture and sequestration  is the process of capturing waste
 co2  from large   such as   transporting it to a storage site  and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere  normally an underground   the aim is to prevent the release of large quantities of co2 into the atmosphere  from fossil fuel use in power generation and other industries   it is a potential means of
the contribution of
to
and   although co2 has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes  including   the long term storage of co2 is a relatively new concept  the first commercial example was the
in 2000  other examples include
and
   ccs  can also be used to describe the
of co2 from ambient air as a
technique 
an integrated pilot-scale ccs power plant was to begin operating in september 2008 in the eastern german power plant
run by utility   to test the technological feasibility and economic efficiency  ccs applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce co2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 8090  compared to a plant without ccs  the
estimates that the economic potential of ccs could be between 10  and 55  of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100 
carbon dioxide can be captured out of air or fossil fuel power plant flue gas using absorption  or    membrane gas separation  or adsorption technologies  amines are the leading carbon scrubbing technology  capturing and compressing co2 may increase the energy needs of a coal-fired ccs plant by 2540   these and other system costs are estimated to increase the cost per watt energy produced by 2191  for fossil fuel power plants  applying the technology to existing plants would be more expensive  especially if they are far from a sequestration site  a 2005 industry report suggests that with successful research  development and deployment  rd d   sequestered coal-based electricity generation in 2025 may cost less than unsequestered coal-based electricity generation today 
storage of the co2 is envisaged either in deep geological formations  or in the form of
  deep ocean storage is not currently considered feasible due to the associated effect of   geological formations are currently considered the most promising sequestration sites  the
 netl  reported that north america has enough storage capacity for more than 900 years worth of carbon dioxide at current production rates  a general problem is that long term predictions about submarine or underground storage security are very difficult and uncertain  and there is still the risk that co2 might leak into the atmosphere

capture  
main articles            and
capturing co2 is most effective at point sources  such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities  industries with major co2 emissions    synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuel-based
plants  extracting co2 from air is also possible  but not very practical because the co2 is not concentrated 
organisms that produce
by
generate cool  essentially pure co2 that can be pumped underground  fermentation produces slightly less co2 than ethanol by weight 
flue gas from the combustion of coal in oxygen has a large concentration of co2  about 10-15  co2 whereas natural gas power plant flue gas is about 5-10  co2  therefore  it is more energy and cost efficient to capture co2 from coal-fired power plants  impurities in co2 streams  like sulfurs and water  could have a significant effect on their phase behaviour and could pose a significant threat of increased corrosion of pipeline and well materials  10  in instances where co2 impurities exist  especially with air capture  a scrubbing separation process would be needed to initially clean the flue gas  according to the wallula energy resource center in washington state  by gasifying coal  it is possible to capture approximately 65  of carbon dioxide embedded in it and sequester it in a solid form 
broadly  three different configurations of technologies for capture exist  post-combustion  pre-combustion  and oxyfuel combustion 
in   the co2 is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel this is the scheme that would be applied to fossil-fuel burning power plants  here  carbon dioxide is captured from
at
or other large point sources  the technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications  although not at the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station  post combustion capture is most popular in research because existing fossil fuel power plants can be retrofitted to include ccs technology in this configuration 
the technology for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer  chemical  gaseous fuel  h2  ch4   and power production  in these cases  the fossil fuel is partially oxidized  for instance in a   the resulting
 co and h2  is
into co2 and h2  the resulting co2 can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream  the h2 can now be used as fuel  the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place  there are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture  the co2 is removed after combustion of fossil fuels  but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure  this scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants  or to existing plants where re-powering is an option  the capture before expansion  i e  from pressurized gas  is standard in almost all industrial co2 capture processes  at the same scale as will be required for utility power plants 
in
the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air  to limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion  cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber  the flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour  the latter of which is condensed through cooling  the result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored  power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as  zero emission  cycles  because the co2 stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream  as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture  but the flue gas stream itself  a certain fraction of the co2 generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water  to warrant the label  zero emission  the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately  the technique is promising  but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy 
capture technologies  
carbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with     or
technologies  absorption  or   with
is currently the dominant capture technology  membrane and adsorption technologies are still in the developmental research stages  initiating primary pilot plants in the near future 
 mofs  are a novel class of materials that offer promise for carbon capture using adsorption technologies 
carbon dioxide adsorbs to a mof through
or
based on the porosity and
of the mof leaving behind a
poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly  the carbon dioxide is then stripped off the mof using temperature swing adsorption  tsa  or pressure swing adsorption  psa  so the mof can be reused  adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the co2 is removed from the sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused  monoethanolamine  mea  solutions  the leading amine for capturing co2  have a heat capacity between 3-4 j g k since they are mostly water  higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step  thus  to optimize a mof for carbon capture  low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired  additionally  high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much co2 as possible from the flue gas  however  there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure  as the amount of co2 captured increases  the energy  and therefore cost  required to regenerate increases  a large drawback of using mofs for ccs is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability  current research is looking to optimize mof properties for ccs  but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable mof  metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of mofs 
capture is attributed to about two thirds of the total cost of ccs  making it limit the wide-scale deployment of ccs technologies  to optimize a co2 capture process would significantly increase the feasibility of ccs since the transport and storage steps of ccs are rather mature technologies 
an alternate method under development is
 clc   chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier  metal oxide particles react with a solid  liquid or gaseous fuel in a
combustor  producing solid metal particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor  the water vapor is condensed  leaving pure carbon dioxide  which can then be sequestered  the solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air  producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor  a variant of chemical looping is   which uses the alternating carbonation and then calcination of a
based carrier as a means of capturing co2 
a few engineering proposals have been made for the more difficult task of
 a form of
 but work in this area is still in its infancy  capture costs are estimated to be higher than from point sources  but may be feasible for dealing with emissions from diffuse sources such as automobiles and aircraft  the theoretically required energy for air capture is only slightly more than for capture from point sources  the additional costs come from the devices that use the natural air flow  global research technologies demonstrated a pre-prototype of air capture technology in 2007 
transport  
after capture  the co2 would have to be transported to suitable storage sites  this would most likely be done by pipeline  which is generally the cheapest form of transport  in 2008  there were approximately 5,800km of co2 pipelines in the united states  used to transport co2 to oil production fields where it is then injected into older fields to extract oil  the injection of co2 to produce oil is generally called
or eor    in addition  there are several pilot programs in various stages to test the long-term storage of co2 in non-oil producing geologic formations 
according to the congressional research service   there are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements  economic regulation  utility cost recovery  regulatory classification of co2 itself  and pipeline safety  furthermore  because co2 pipelines for
are already in use today  policy decisions affecting co2 pipelines take on an urgency that is unrecognized by many  federal classification of co2 as both a commodity  by the   and as a pollutant  by the   could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future ccs implementation  but also to ensure consistency of future ccs with co2 pipeline operations today  
ships could also be utilized for transport where pipelines are not feasible  these methods are currently used for transporting co2 for other applications 
sequestration  
main article 
various forms have been conceived for permanent storage of co2  these forms include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations  including saline formations and exhausted gas fields   and solid storage by reaction of co2 with metal
to produce stable  
geological storage  
also known as geo-sequestration  this method involves injecting carbon dioxide  generally in
form  directly into underground geological formations      saline formations  unmineable   and saline-filled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites  various physical  e g   highly impermeable   and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the co2 from escaping to the surface 
co2 is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to   approximately 30 to 50 million metric tonnes of co2 are injected annually in the united states into declining oil fields  this option is attractive because the geology of hydrocarbon reservoirs is generally well understood and storage costs may be partly offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered  disadvantages of old oil fields are their geographic distribution and their limited capacity  as well as the fact that subsequent burning of the additional oil recovered will offset much or all of the reduction in co2 emissions 
unmineable coal seams can be used to store co2 because the co2 molecules attach to the surface of coal  the technical feasibility  however  depends on the permeability of the coal bed  in the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed   and the methane can be recovered     the sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the co2 storage  burning the resultant methane  however  would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original co2 
saline formations contain highly mineralized brines  and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans  saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases  the main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence  the major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them  especially compared to oil fields  to keep the cost of storage acceptable  the geophysical exploration may be limited  resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure  unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds  no side product will offset the storage cost  leakage of co2 back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline aquifer storage  current research shows  however  that trapping mechanisms such as structural trapping  residual trapping  solubility trapping and mineral trapping could immobilize the co2 underground and reduce the risk of leakage 
enhanced oil recovery  
 eor  is a generic term for techniques used to increase the amount of
that can be extracted from an   in carbon capture   sequestration enhanced oil recovery  ccs eor   carbon dioxide is injected into an oil field to recover oil that is often never recovered using more traditional methods 
development and production in u s  oil reservoirs can include up to three distinct phases  primary  secondary  and tertiary  or enhanced  recovery  during primary recovery only about 10 percent of a
original oil in place is typically produced  secondary recovery techniques extend a field s productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production   resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place  however  with much of the easy-to-produce oil already recovered from u s  oil fields  producers have attempted several tertiary  or
 eor   techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent  or more  of the reservoir s original oil in place 
an example of a project that will use ccs eor is the
in   due to the kemper project s close proximity to oil fields  the
from producing
will be transported to the neighboring
for  
ocean storage  
in the past  it was suggested that co2 could be stored in the oceans  but this would only exacerbate
and has been made illegal under specific regulations  ocean storage is no longer considered feasible 
mineral storage  
in this process  co2 is
reacted with available metal oxides  which in turn produces stable carbonates  e g       this process occurs naturally over many years and is responsible for a great amount of surface   the idea of using
has been promoted by the geochemist prof  schuiling  the reaction rate can be made faster  for example  with a
or by reacting at higher temperatures and or pressures  or by pre-treatment of the minerals  although this method can require additional energy  the
estimates that a power plant equipped with ccs using mineral storage will need 60180  more energy than a power plant without ccs 
the economics of mineral carbonation at scale are now being tested in a world-first pilot plant project based in newcastle  australia  new techniques for mineral activation and reaction have been developed the greenmag group and the
and funded by the
and australian governments to be operational by 2013 
in 2009 it was reported that scientists had mapped 6,000 square miles  16,000km2  of rock formations in the u s  that could be used to store 500 years  worth of u s  carbon dioxide emissions  a study on mineral sequestration in the us states 
carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring mg and ca containing minerals with co2 to form carbonates has many unique advantages  most notabl e  is the fact that carbonates have a lower energy state than co2  which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally  e g   the weathering of rock over geologic time periods   secondly  the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant  finally  the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re-release of co2 into the atmosphere is not an issue  however  conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures  the significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics

ultramafic mine tailings are a readily available source of fine-grained metal oxides that can act as artificial carbon sinks to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions in the mining industry  accelerating passive co2 sequestration via mineral carbonation may be achieved through microbial processes that enhance mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation 
energy requirements  
the energy requirements of sequestration processes may be significant  in one paper  sequestration consumed 25 percent of the plant s rated 600-megawatt output capacity 
after adding co2 capture and compression  the capacity of the coal-fired power plant is reduced to 457 mw 
leakage  
as it appeared fewer than two weeks after the eruption  august 29  1986 
a major concern with ccs is whether leakage of stored co2 will compromise ccs as a climate change mitigation option  for well-selected  designed and managed geological storage sites  ipcc estimates that risks are comparable to those associated with current hydrocarbon activity  however  this finding is contested due to a lack of experience in such long term storage  co2 could be trapped for millions of years  and although some leakage occurs upwards through the soil  well selected storage sites are likely to retain over 99  of the injected co2 over 1000 years  leakage through the injection pipe is a greater risk 
although the injection pipe is usually protected with
to prevent release on a power outage  there is still a risk that the pipe itself could tear and leak due to the pressure  the
incident in december 2008 was an example  where a modest release of co2 from a pipeline under a bridge resulted in the deaths of some ducks sheltering there  in order to measure accidental carbon releases more accurately and decrease the risk of fatalities through this type of leakage  the implementation of co2 alert meters around the project perimeter has been proposed  malfunction of a carbon dioxide industrial fire suppression system in a large warehouse released co2 and 14 citizens collapsed on the nearby public road  a release of co2 from a salt mine killed a person at distance of 300 meters 
in 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered co2 rose from
in
and asphyxiated 1,700 people  while the carbon had been sequestered naturally  some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially  the
disaster resulted from a volcanic event  which very suddenly released as much as a cubic kilometre of co2 gas from a pool of naturally occurring co2 under the lake in a deep narrow valley  the location of this pool of co2 is not a place where man can inject or store co2  and this pool was not known about nor monitored until after the occurrence of the natural disaster 
for ocean storage  the retention of co2 would depend on the depth  the ipcc estimates 3085  of the sequestered carbon dioxide would be retained after 500 years for depths 10003000 m  mineral storage is not regarded as having any risks of leakage  the ipcc recommends that limits be set to the amount of leakage that can take place  this might rule out deep ocean storage as an option 
at the conditions of the deeper oceans   about 400 bar or 40 mpa  280 k  waterco2 l  mixing is very low  where carbonate formation acidification is the rate limiting step   but the formation of water-co2 hydrates  a kind of solid water cage that surrounds the co2  is favorable 
to further investigate the safety of co2 sequestration  norway s
can be studied  as it is the oldest plant that stores co2 on an industrial scale  according to an environmental assessment of the gas field which was conducted after ten years of operation  the author affirmed that geosequestration of co2 was the most definite form of permanent geological storage of co2 
available geological information shows absence of major tectonic events after the deposition of the utsira formation  saline reservoir   this implies that the geological environment is tectonically stable and a site suitable for carbon dioxide storage  the solubility trapping  is  the most permanent and secure form of geological storage 
in march 2009 statoilhydro issued a study showing the slow spread of co2 in the formation after more than 10 years operation 
phase i of the
in   canada has determined that the likelihood of stored co2 release is less than one percent in 5,000 years  a january 2011 report  however  claimed
in land above that project  this report was strongly refuted by the ieaghg weyburn-midale co2 monitoring and storage project  which issued an eight-page analysis of the study  claiming that it showed no evidence of leakage from the reservoir 
the liability of potential leak s  is one of the largest barriers to large-scale ccs  to assess and reduce such liability  the leakage of stored gasses  particularly   into the atmosphere may be detected via atmospheric gas monitoring  and can be quantified directly via the
flux measurements 
monitoring geological sequestration sites  
in order to detect carbon dioxide leaks and the effectiveness of geological sequestration sites  different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir  leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere  it is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it  and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as
policies  evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon  as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process  to quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released  should a leak occur  or to closely watch stored co2  there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels 
subsurface monitoring  
in subsurface monitoring  there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of co2 in the reservoir  a direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample  this drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock  it also only provides data at a specific location  indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted  this approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region  it does however lack precision  both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously 
seismic monitoring  
is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring  it is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a   or inside a well using   these vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers  it can identify migration pathways of the co2 plume  two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the
and the frio co2 injection test  although this method can confirm the presence of co2 in a given region  it cannot determine the specifics of the environment or concentration of co2 
surface monitoring  
is a surface monitoring technique that measures the flux of co2 from the grounds surface  it involves measuring co2 concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer  this provides a measure of the total vertical flux of co2  eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks  however  the natural carbon cycle  such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants  would have to be accounted for and a baseline co2 cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring  an example of eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the   another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers  these chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer  this also measures the vertical flux of co2  the disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting co2 leaks over the entire sequestration site 
insar monitoring  
monitoring is another type of surface monitoring  it involves a satellite sending signals down to the earths surface where it is reflected back to the satellites receiver  from this  the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point  in ccs  the injection of co2 in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures  these high pressured  fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape  in areas of stored co2  the grounds surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers  these changes in elevation of the earths surface corresponds to a change in the distance from the insar satellite which is then detectable and measurable 
carbon dioxide recycling - carbon capture and utilization  ccu   
main article 
recycling co2 may offer a response to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary  industrial  emitters in the near to medium term    but is usually considered a different technological category from ccs  technologies under development  such as bio ccs algal synthesis  utilises pre-smokestack co2  such as from a coal-fired power station  as a useful feedstock input to the production of oil-rich algae in solar membranes to produce oil for plastics and transport fuel  including aviation fuel   and nutritious stock-feed for farm animal production  the co2 and other captured greenhouse gases are injected into the membranes containing waste water and select strains of algae causing  together with sunlight or uv light  an oil rich biomass that doubles in mass every 24 hours   
the bio ccs algal synthesis process is based on earth science photosynthesis  the technology is entirely retrofittable and collocated with the emitter  and the capital outlays may offer a return upon investment due to the high value commodities produced  oil for plastics  fuel and feed

another potentially useful way of dealing with industrial sources of co2 is to convert it into hydrocarbons where it can be stored or reused as fuel or to make plastics  there are a number of projects investigating this possibility 
variants exist based on
which can be used to create liquid fuels  though this process requires a great deal of energy input  although the creation of fuel from atmospheric co2 is not a
technique  nor does it actually function as
 because carbon dioxide will be re-released when the fuel is burned  it nevertheless is potentially useful in the creation of a
economy 
other uses are the production of stable carbonates from silicates  e g

single step methods  methanol  
a proven process to produce a hydrocarbon is to make   methanol is easily synthesized from co2 and h2  based on this fact the idea of a

single step methods  hydrocarbons  
at the department of industrial chemistry and engineering of materials at the university of messina  italy  there is a project to develop a system which works like a fuel-cell in reverse  whereby a catalyst is used that enables sunlight to split water into hydrogen ions and oxygen gas  the ions cross a membrane where they react with the co2 to create hydrocarbons 
two step methods  
if co2 is heated to 2400c  it splits into carbon monoxide  co  and oxygen  the
can then be used to convert the co into hydrocarbons  the required temperature can be achieved by using a chamber containing a mirror to focus sunlight on the gas  rival teams are developing such chambers  at solarec and at   both based in   according to sandia these chambers could provide enough fuel to power 100  of domestic vehicles using 5800km2  unlike biofuels this would not take fertile land away from crops but would be land that is not being used for anything else    the british tv presenter  visited a demonstration plant in a programme in his

in the united states  four different
projects are moving forward  which have publicly announced plans to incorporate carbon capture and storage 
american clean coal fuels  in their illinois clean fuels  icf  project  is developing a 30,000-barrel  4,800m3  per day biomass and
project in   which will market the co2 created at the plant for enhanced oil recovery applications  by combining sequestration and
feedstocks  the icf project will achieve dramatic reductions in the life-cycle carbon footprint of the fuels they produce  if sufficient biomass is used  the plant should have the capability to go life-cycle carbon negative  meaning that effectively  for each gallon of their fuel that is used  carbon is pulled out of the air  and put into the ground 
baard energy  in their ohio river clean fuels project  is developing a 53,000bbl d  8,400m3 d  coal and biomass to liquids project  which has announced plans to market the plant s co2 for enhanced oil recovery 
rentech is developing a 29,600-barrel  4,710m3  per day coal and biomass to liquids plant in   which will market the plant s co2 for enhanced oil recovery  the first phase of the project is expected in 2011 
dkrw   is developing a 15,00020,000-barrel  2,4003,200m3  per day
plant in   which will market its plant s co2 for   the project is expected to begin operation in 2013 
in october 2009  the u s  department of energy awarded grants to twelve industrial carbon capture and storage  iccs  projects to conduct a phase 1 feasibility study  the doe plans to select 3 to 4 of those projects to proceed into phase 2  design and construction  with operational startup to occur by 2015    pacific northwest division  boise  inc   and
are studying a ccs system for capture and storage of co2 emissions associated with the pulp and paper production industry  the site of the study is the boise white paper l l c  paper mill located near the township of wallula in southeastern washington state  the plant generates approximately 1.2 mmt of co2 annually from a set of three recovery boilers that are mainly fired with black liquor  a recycled byproduct formed during the pulping of wood for paper-making  fluor corporation will design a customized version of their econamine plus carbon capture technology  the fluor system also will be designed to remove residual quantities of remnant air pollutants from stack gases as part of the co2 capture process  battelle is leading preparation of an environmental information volume  eiv  for the entire project  including geologic storage of the captured co2 in deep flood basalt formations that exist in the greater region  the eiv will describe the necessary site characterization work  sequestration system infrastructure  and monitoring program to support permanent sequestration of the co2 captured at the plant 
in addition to individual carbon capture and sequestration projects  there are a number of u s  programs designed to research  develop  and deploy ccs technologies on a broad scale  these include the national energy technology laboratory s  netl  carbon sequestration program  regional carbon sequestration partnerships and the
 cslf  
secarb  
in october 2007  the bureau of economic geology at the
received a 10-year   38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored long-term project in the united states studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of co2 for underground storage  the project is a research program of the southeast regional carbon sequestration partnership  secarb   funded by the
of the
 doe  
the secarb partnership will demonstrate co2 injection rate and storage capacity in the tuscaloosa-woodbine geologic system that stretches from texas to florida  the region has the potential to store more than 200 billion tons   of co2 from major point sources in the region  equal to about 33 years of overall u s  emissions at present rates  beginning in fall 2007  the project will inject co2 at the rate of one million tons   per year  for up to 1.5 years  into brine up to 10,000 feet  3,000 m  below the land surface near the cranfield oil field  which lays about 15 miles  24km  east of   experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain co2 
kemper project  
the   is an electrical generating station currently under construction in     a subsidiary of   began construction of the plant in 2010  the project is central to president obama s climate plan  once operational  the kemper project will be a first-of-its-kind electricity plant to employ gasification and carbon capture technologies at this scale 
however  there have been project management problems  the power plant construction has been delayed and is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2016  more than two years behind schedule  at a cost of  6.6 billionthree times original cost estimate  according to a
analysis  kemper is the most expensive power plant ever built for the watts of electricity it will generate 
texas clean energy project  
the texas clean energy project  tcep  is a nowgen
 igcc  facility that will incorporate carbon capture  utilization and storage  ccus  technology in a first-of-its-kind commercial
power plant  this project is expected to be operational in 2018  it will be the first us-based power plant to combine both igcc and capture 90  of its emissions

united kingdom  
the government of the united kingdom launched a first tender process for a ccs demonstration project in 2007  the project were to use post-combustion technology on coal-fired power generation at 300400megawatts or equivalent  the project aimed to be operational by 2014  the government announced in june 2008 that four companies had pre-qualified for the competition  bp alternative energy international limited  eon uk plc  peel power limited and scottish power generation limited  bp subsequently withdrew from the competition  claiming it could not find a power generator partner  and rwe
sought a judicial review of the process after it did not qualify  this first ccs tender was cancelled in late 2011 when government could not reach agreement with the scottishpower shell national grid consortium on terms and cost  for the project based on retrofitting the existing longannet coal-fired power station in scotland 
a second tender process was launched by government in 2012 as part of decc s ccs commercialisation programme and two bidders  namely the shell peterhead gas-fired power station ccs project and the white rose ccs project based upon a new oxy-fuel coal-fired unit at drax power station were selected in 2013 to proceed to a funded front-end engineering and design phase  this second tender was cancelled in november 2015 following a government spending review at the time of the chancellor s autumn statement

australia  
main article 
the federal resources and energy minister martin ferguson opened the first geosequestration project in the southern hemisphere in april 2008  the demonstration plant is near nirranda south in south western victoria     the plant is owned by the cooperative research centre for greenhouse gas technologies  co2crc   co2crc is a non profit research collaboration supported by government and industry  the project has stored and monitored over 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-rich gas which was extracted from a natural gas reservoir via a well  compressed and piped 2.25km to a new well  there the gas has been injected into a depleted natural gas reservoir approximately two kilometers below the surface  the project has moved to a second stage and is investigating carbon dioxide trapping in a saline aquifer 1500 meters below the surface  the otway project is a research and demonstration project  focused on comprehensive monitoring and verification 
this plant does not propose to capture co2 from coal-fired power generation  though two co2crc demonstration projects at a victorian power station and research gasifier are demonstrating solvent  membrane  and adsorbent capture technologies from coal combustion  currently  only small-scale projects are storing co2 stripped from the products of combustion of coal burnt for electricity generation at coal-fired   work currently being carried out by the greenmag group and the

limitations of ccs for power stations  
critics say large-scale ccs deployment is unproven and decades away from being commercialized  they say that it is risky and expensive and that a better option is   some environmental groups point out that ccs technology leaves behind dangerous waste material that has to be stored  just like nuclear power stations 
another limitation of ccs is its energy penalty  the technology is expected to use between 10 and 40 percent of the energy produced by a power station  wide-scale adoption of ccs may erase efficiency gains in coal power plants of the last 50 years  and increase resource consumption by one third  even taking the fuel penalty into account  however  overall levels of co2 abatement would remain high at approximately 8090   compared to a plant without ccs  it is possible for ccs  when combined with biomass  to result in net negative emissions  though  all of the currently  as of feb 2011  operational beccs    plants operate on point emissions other than power stations  such as
refineries 
the use of ccs can reduce co2 emissions from the stacks of coal power plants by 8590  or more  but it has no effect on co2 emissions due to the mining and transport of coal  it will actually  increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net delivered power and will increase all ecological  land-use  air-pollution  and water-pollution impacts from coal mining  transport  and processing  because the ccs system requires 25  more energy  thus 25  more coal combustion  than does a system without ccs  
another concern regards the permanence of storage schemes  opponents to ccs claim that safe and permanent storage of co2 cannot be guaranteed and that even very low leakage rates could undermine any climate mitigation effect  in 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered co2 rose from
in
and asphyxiated 1,700 people  while the carbon had been sequestered naturally  some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially 
on one hand 
claims that ccs could lead to a doubling of coal plant costs  it is also claimed by opponents to ccs that money spent on ccs will divert investments away from other solutions to climate change  on the other hand  ccs is pointed out as economically attractive in comparison to other forms of low carbon electricity generation and seen by the
and others as a critical component for meeting
such as 450 ppm and 350 ppm 
cost  
although the processes involved in ccs have been demonstrated in other industrial applications  no commercial scale projects which integrate these processes exist  the costs therefore are somewhat uncertain  some recent credible estimates indicate that the cost of capturing and storing carbon dioxide is us 60 per ton  corresponding to an increase in electricity prices of about us 6c per kwh  based on typical coal-fired power plant emissions of 0.97kg  2.13lb  co2 per kwh   this would double the typical us industrial electricity price  now at around 6c per kwh  and increase the typical retail residential electricity price by about 50   assuming 100  of power is from coal  which may not necessarily be the case  as this varies from state to state   similar  approximate  price increases would likely be expected in coal dependent countries such as australia  because the capture technology and chemistry  as well as the transport and injection costs from such power plants would not  in an overall sense  vary significantly from country to country   
the reasons that ccs is expected to cause such power price increases are several  firstly  the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing co2 significantly raises the operating costs of ccs-equipped power plants  in addition  there are added investment and capital costs  the process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with ccs by about 25  for a coal-fired plant  and about 15  for a gas-fired plant  the cost of this extra fuel  as well as storage and other system costs  are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with ccs by 3060   depending on the specific circumstances  pre-commercial ccs demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature ccs technology  the total additional costs of an early large-scale ccs demonstration project are estimated to be 0.5-1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime  other applications are possible  in the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage  walker architects published the first co2 gas
application  proposing the use of sequestered co2 for energy storage on october 24  2008  to date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined

all costs refer to costs for energy from newly built  large-scale plants  natural gas combined cycle costs are based on natural gas prices of us 2.804.40 per gj   based   energy costs for pc and igcc are based on
costs of us 1.001.50 per gj   note that the costs are very dependent on fuel prices  which change continuously   in addition to other factors such as capital costs  also note that for eor  the savings are greater for higher oil prices  current gas and oil prices are substantially higher than the figures used here  all figures in the table are from table 8.3a in  ipcc  2005  
the cost of ccs depends on the cost of capture and storage  which varies according to the method used  geological storage in saline formations or depleted oil or gas fields typically cost us 0.508.00 per tonne of co2 injected  plus an additional us 0.100.30 for monitoring costs  when storage is combined with
to extract extra oil from an oil field  however  the storage could yield net benefits of us 1016 per tonne of co2 injected  based on 2003 oil prices   this would likely negate some of the effect of the carbon capture when the oil was burnt as fuel  even taking this into account  as the table above shows  the benefits do not outweigh the extra costs of capture   
cost of electricity generated by different sources including those incorporating ccs technologies can be found in   if co2 capture was part of a fuel cycle then the co2 would have value rather than be a cost  the proposed solar fuel or methane cycle proposed by the    amongst others is an example  this  solar fuel  cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water  the hydrogen is then combined with co2 to create synthetic natural gas sng and stored in the gas network  see the latest cost report on the cost of co2 capture produced by the
governments around the world have provided a range of different types of funding support to ccs demonstration projects  including tax credits  allocations and grants  the funding is associated with both a desire to accelerate innovation activities for ccs as a low-carbon technology and the need for economic stimulus activities  as of 2011  approximately us 23.5bn has been made available to support large-scale ccs demonstration projects around the world 
carbon capture and storage and the kyoto protocol  
one way to finance future ccs projects could be through the
of the   at
in 2010  the subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice  at its thirty-third session  issued a draft document recommending the inclusion of carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations in clean development mechanism project activities  at
in   a final agreement was reached enabling ccs projects to receive support through the clean development mechanism

the theoretical merit of ccs systems is the reduction of co2 emissions by up to 90   depending on plant type  generally  environmental effects from use of ccs arise during power production  co2 capture  transport  and storage  issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections 
additional energy is required for co2 capture  and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power  depending on the plant type  for new super-critical pulverized coal  pc  plants using current technology  the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40   while for natural gas combined cycle  ngcc  plants the range is 1122  and for coal-based gasification combined cycle  igcc  systems it is 1425   ipcc  2005   obviously  fuel use and environmental problems arising from mining and extraction of coal or gas increase accordingly  plants equipped with

require proportionally greater amounts of  
ipcc has provided estimates of air emissions from various ccs plant designs  see table below   while co2 is drastically reduced though never completely captured  emissions of air pollutants increase significantly  generally due to the energy penalty of capture  hence  the use of ccs entails a reduction in air quality  type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology  co2 is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic co2 at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing co2 at higher temperatures in a desorber  chilled ammonia ccs plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air   functionalized ammonia  emit less ammonia  but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide  which is present in any flue gas even after denox  nevertheless  there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions  nevertheless  all the capture plants amines have in common  that practically 100  of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas  the same applies to dust ash
