greenfuel technologies corporation  gft  was a
that developed a process of
using emissions from   mainly to produce  
it was based in   greenfuel shut down operations on may 13  2009 after having raised more than  70 million in investments  citing it had run out of funds  and a victim of the economy

history  
the gft president  chief technology officer and the inventor of a newly patented system for growing pollution-digesting algae inexpensively on an industrial scale is   who founded the company in april  2001 
included berzin in its list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008 
a beta emission reduction system was installed at an
cogeneration facility in 2004 and after performing beyond expectations was moved to a larger power plant in fall 2005  pilot units were tested at power plants in  
and   although the algal biomass produced by the process consists of  
and carbohydrates which could be used to produce a variety of products  gft seems to be focusing on biofuel products  greenfuel s large scale algae to biofuel process at the arizona public service redhawk power facility won the 2006 platts emissions energy project of the year award 
in november 2006
 aps  announced that it and its partner greenfuel technologies will attempt to replicate their success of creating biofuels from algae grown using carbon dioxide  co2  emissions from a power plant 
in 2007  the company had to shut down its third-generation bioreactor facility in arizona after the plant produced more algae than the companys equipment could handle  at the same time  the company learned that its algae harvesting system would cost twice as much as expected  in 2007 they announced a restructuring  some 25 employees  about half the companys staff  were laid off as a result of the plant shutdown

known as emissions-to-biofuels  the process could use a photosynthetic
supplied with exhaust gases from a fossil fuel combustion source to grow algae  as
emissions are delivered to the   carbon dioxide and other pollutants are absorbed and utilized by the algae to grow at an exponential rate  once harvested  the algae is processed to produce a variety of solids such as protein and   gases such as   and
such as
and  
application  
sources of carbon rich exhaust include manufacturing facilities and electricity generation plants  especially those which burn   once the algal biomass is harvested and processed  the resulting fuel may be sold for additional revenue or utilized on-site 
benefits  
the biofuel yield using the greenfuel technique is 30 times higher per hectare compared to the yield of oil derived from conventional terrestrial crops  emissions of carbon dioxide are reduced by 40  and emissions of oxides of nitrogen are reduced by up to 85   plant retrofits can be made with minimal disruption to existing facilities 
large-scale algae farming plants  
greenfuel technologies had launched the second phase of a major project with spanish renewable energy firm aurantia
to build a large-scale algae farming plant adjacent to a co2-spewing
