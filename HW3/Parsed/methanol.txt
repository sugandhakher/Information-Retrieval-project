methanol  also known as methyl alcohol among others  is a
with the
3  often abbreviated meoh   methanol acquired the name  wood alcohol  because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the
of wood  today  industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from     and  
methanol is the simplest   being only a
linked to a
group  it is a light    colorless 
liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of
 drinking alcohol   however  unlike ethanol  methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption  at room temperature  it is a   and is used as an       and as a
for   it is also used for producing
via
reaction 
methanol is produced naturally in the
of many varieties of bacteria  and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment  as a result  the atmosphere contains a small amount of methanol vapor  but in only a few days  atmospheric methanol is
by sunlight to produce carbon dioxide and water 
methanol is also found in abundant quantities in star forming regions of space  and is used in astronomy as a marker for such regions  it is detected through its spectral emission lines 
methanol when drunk is
first to
and then to
or
salts  these are poisonous to the central nervous system and may result in blindness  coma  and death  because of these toxic properties  methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses  this addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol  commonly known as    or  methylated spirit   from liquor
in the us and some other countries

toxicity

is
from methanol  symptoms may include a   poor coordination      and a specific smell on the breath 
may start as early as twelve hours after exposure  long term outcomes may include blindness and   toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount 
methanol poisoning most commonly occurs following the drinking of   this may be accidental or done purposefully in an   toxicity may also rarely occur through skin exposure or breathing in the fumes  when methanol is broken down by the body it results in     and
which cause much of the toxicity  the diagnosis may be suspected when there is
or an increased

early treatment increases the chance of a good outcome  treatment consists of stabilizing the person  followed by the use of an   the prefered antidote is   with
used if this is not avaliable 
may also be used in those where there is
damage or a high degree of   other treatments may include     and  
have occurred due to contamination of   this is more common in the   in 2013 more than 1700 cases occurred in the united states  those affected are often adults and male  outcomes may be good with early treatment  toxicity to methanol has been described as early as 1856 
applications  
methanol is used primarily as a
for the manufacture of chemicals  and as a
for specialized   as mentioned above  it is a common de-naturing agent  as a common laboratory solvent  is especially useful for     and
due to its low
cutoff 
chemical industry  
methanol is primarily used in making other chemicals  about 40  of methanol is converted to   and from there into products as diverse as plastics        and
textiles 
in the early 1970s  a process was developed by
for
fuel for vehicles  one such industrial facility was built at
in new zealand in the 1980s  in the 1990s  large amounts of methanol were used in the united states to produce the gasoline additive
 mtbe   while mtbe is no longer marketed in the u s   it is still widely used in other parts of the world  methanol  or less commonly    is a component in the
of
for production of  
other chemical derivatives of methanol include
 dme   which has replaced
as an   and   dimethyl ether can be blended with
 lpg  for home heating and cooking  and can be used as a replacement for transportation diesel fuel 
of high interest to the
marketplace  methanol is an important ingredient in new and lower-cost methods for producing   which is   such methods include methanol-to-  mto   methanol-to-  mto mtp   metathesis  propane dehydrogenation  pdh   high severity fcc  and olefins cracking 
the market for proponyl became tight when the
prices fell in the usa with the exploration of shale gas reserves  the low priced
produced from this raw material has given chemical producers in north america a feedstock advantage  such change has put -fed steam crackers at a disadvantageous position  with many of them shutting down or revamping to use
as feedstock  nevertheless  the propylene output rates from ethane-fed crackers are negligible 
fuel for vehicles  
main articles 
and
methanol is occasionally used to fuel   pure methanol is required by rule to be used in    
sprint cars  as well as midgets  modifieds  etc    and other dirt track series  such as   and   mainly because  in the event of an accident  methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke  since the late 1940s  methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for    
  cars and trucks  such engines use a
filament
that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction    mud racers  and heavily modified
also use methanol as the primary fuel source  methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a
and  until the end of the 2006 season  all vehicles in the
had to run on methanol  as a fuel for mud racers  methanol mixed with gasoline and
produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone 
methanol burns in   including open air  forming carbon dioxide and water 
2 ch3oh   3 o2  2 co2   4 h2o
one problem with high concentrations of methanol in fuel is that alcohols
some metals  particularly aluminium  an acid  albeit weak  methanol attacks the oxide coating that normally protects the aluminum from corrosion 
6 ch3oh   al2o3  2 al och3 3   3 h2o
the resulting
salts are soluble in methanol  resulting in a clean aluminium surface  which is readily oxidized by   also  the methanol can act as an oxidizer 
6 ch3oh   2 al  2 al och3 3   3 h2
this reciprocal process effectively fuels corrosion until either the metal is eaten away or the concentration of ch3oh is negligible  methanol s corrosivity has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors 
organic methanol  produced from wood or other organic materials     has been suggested as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based   low levels of methanol can be used in existing vehicles with the addition of cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors 
methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation  the chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel 
safety in automotive fuels  
pure methanol has been used in
since the mid-1960s  unlike petroleum fires  methanol fires can be
with plain water  a methanol-based fire burns invisibly  unlike gasoline  which burns with a visible flame  if a fire occurs on the track  there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast approaching drivers  but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression  the decision to permanently switch to methanol in american
racing was a result of the devastating crash and explosion at the   which killed drivers
and   in 2007 indycars switched from methanol to ethanol 
government policy  
the
allows up to 3  methanol with an equal amount of cosolvent to be blended with gasoline sold in europe 
uses more than one billion gallons of methanol per year as a transportation fuel in low level blends for conventional vehicles and high level blends in vehicles designed for methanol fuels 
in the us  the
was introduced in the us congress to encourage car manufacturers to build cars capable of using methanol  gasoline  or ethanol fuels  the bill is being championed by the  
production of synthesis gas  
for methanol production of syngas requires the ratio of h2   co to equal 2  the partial oxidation process yields a ratio of 2  and the steam reforming process yields a ratio of 3  the h2   co ratio can be lowered to some extent by the reverse  
co2   h2  co   h2o 
to provide the appropriate stoichiometry for methanol synthesis 
energy carrier  
methanol is useful as an
because it is easier to store than hydrogen and burns cleaner than fossil fuels 
methanol is readily biodegradable in both aerobic  oxygen present  and anaerobic  oxygen absent  environments  methanol will not persist in the environment  the half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days  while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days  such as
at 10730 days   since methanol is
with water and biodegradable  it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater  surface water  air or soil 
other applications  
methanol is a traditional denaturant for ethanol  the product being known as    or  methylated spirit   this was commonly used during the
to discourage consumption of
liquor  and ended up causing several deaths 
methanol is used as a
and as an
in
and  
in some   a small amount of methanol is added to
to provide a carbon food source for the   which convert
to
gas and reduce the nitrification of sensitive  
during   methanol was used as a fuel in several german military rocket designs  under the name m-stoff  and in a roughly 50/50 mixture with   known as  
methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s 
methanol is used as a destaining agent in  
are unique in their low temperature  atmospheric pressure operation  allowing them to be miniaturized to an unprecedented degree  this  combined with the relatively easy and safe storage and handling of methanol  may open the possibility of fuel cell-powered   such as laptop computers and mobile phones 
methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves  methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner  so alcohol stoves are often very simple  sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel  this lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness  similarly  the alcohol can be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling  as with the brand    
methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as  
production  
human metabolite  
small amounts of methanol is a natural endogenous compound found in normal  healthy humans  a study found a mean of 4.5 in the exhaled breath of subjects  the mean endogenous methanol production in humans of 0.45g d may be metabolized from
found in fruit  one
of apple produces up to 1.4g methanol 
from synthesis gas  
carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol  today  the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper and  
on alumina  as first used by
in 1966  at 510 mpa  50100atm  and 250c  482f   the reaction is characterized by high selectivity   99.8   
co   2 h2  ch3oh
since the production of synthesis gas from methane produces three
of hydrogen for every mole of carbon monoxide  whereas the synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide  one way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject
into the methanol synthesis reactor  where it  too  reacts to form methanol according to the equation 
co2   3 h2  ch3oh   h2o
in terms of mechanism  the process occurs via initial conversion of co into co2  which is then  
co2   3 h2  ch3oh   h2o
where the h2o byproduct is recycled via the
co   h2o  co2   h2 
this gives an overall reaction  which is the same as listed above 
co   2 h2  ch3oh
other  
the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol has long been sought as a route to methanol  this route is effected by enzymes such as
but commercial routes remain elusive because of the tendency for over-oxidation  i e   methanol is more readily oxidized than is methane 
quality specifications and analysis  
laboratory use  
methanol is available commercially in various purity grades for fine chemicals 
 synthesis  quality  corresponding to normal commercial methanol 
certified analytical quality
extremely pure qualities for semiconductor manufacture
commercial methanol  
in addition to laboratory grades  commercial methanol is generally classified according to astm purity grades a and aa  methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to grade aa  in addition to water  typical impurities include acetone and ethanol  which are very difficult to separate by distillation   when methanol is delivered by ships or tankers used to transport other substances  contamination by the previous cargo must be expected  comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient  quick test method for deciding whether a batch can be accepted and loaded  traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances  as well as a large number of other compounds  can be detected  further tests for establishing the quality of methanol include measurements of boiling point range  density  permanganate number  turbidity  color index  and acid number  more comprehensive tests include water determination according to the karl fischer method and gas chromatographic determination of byproducts  however  the latter is relatively expensive and time-consuming because several injections using different columns and detectors must be made due to the variety of byproducts present 
history  
in their
process  the
used a mixture of substances  including methanol  which they obtained from the
of wood  pure methanol  however  was first isolated in 1661 by   when he produced it via the distillation of
 boxwood   it later became known as  pyroxylic spirit   in 1834  the french chemists
and
determined its elemental composition 
they also introduced the word  methylene  to organic chemistry  forming it from
methy    alcoholic liquid    hl  
 patch of trees   with greek language errors   wood  substance    greek   xylon  was intended  and the components are in the wrong order for greek  the term  methyl  was derived in about 1840 by
from  methylene   and was then applied to describe  methyl alcohol   this was shortened to  methanol  in 1892 by the   the
used in
to form names of
groups  was extracted from the word  methyl  
in 1923  the german chemists
and mathias pier  working for  basf   developed a means to convert
 a mixture of     and   into methanol  us patent 1,569,775 was applied for on 4 sep 1924 and issued on 12 january 1926  the process used a
and
with extremely vigorous conditionspressures ranging from 50 to 220   and temperatures up to 450c  modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts  commonly copper  capable of operating at lower pressures  the modern low pressure methanol  lpm  was developed by ici in the late 1960s  with the technology now owned by johnson matthey  which is a leading licensor of methanol technology 
methanol is one of the most heavily traded chemical commodities in the world  with an estimated global demand of around 27 to 29 million metric tons  in recent years  production capacity has expanded considerably  with new plants coming on-stream in south america  china and the middle east  the latter based on access to abundant supplies of methane gas  even though nameplate production capacity  coal-based  in china has grown significantly  operating rates are estimated to be as low as 50 to 60   no new production capacity is scheduled to come on-stream until 2015 
the main applications for methanol are the production of
 used in construction and wooden boarding   acetic acid  basis for a o  pet-bottles  
 fuel component and replacement for the very volatile   and more recently for the formation of methyl
in the production of bio-diesel  in china  demand is expected to grow exponentially  not only caused by a growing internal market of the traditional applications  but accelerated by new applications  such as direct blending  with gasoline   methanol-to-olefins  e g  propylene  and dme  methanol can also be used to produce gasoline 
artists impression of the disc around the young star  
the use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the oil crises of the 1970s due to its availability  low cost  and environmental benefits  by the mid-1990s  over 20,000 methanol  flexible fuel vehicles  capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the u s  in addition  low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in europe during much of the 1980s and early-1990s  automakers stopped building methanol ffvs by the late-1990s  switching their attention to ethanol-fueled vehicles  while the methanol ffv program was a technical success  rising methanol pricing in the mid- to late-1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished the interest in methanol fuels 
in 2006  astronomers using the
array of radio telescopes at
discovered a large cloud of methanol in space  288 billion miles across  in 2016  astronomers detected methyl alcohol in a planet-forming disc around the young star
using
radio telescope
