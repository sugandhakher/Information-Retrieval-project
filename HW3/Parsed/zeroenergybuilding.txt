zero-energy test building in      
a zero-energy building  also known as a zero net energy  zne  building  net-zero energy building  nzeb   or net zero building  is a
with zero net energy consumption  meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of
created on the site  or in other definitions by renewable energy sources elsewhere  these buildings consequently contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than similar non-zne buildings  they do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce greenhouse gases  but at other times reduce
and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount 
most zero net energy buildings get half or more of their energy from the   and return the same amount at other times  buildings that produce a surplus of energy over the year may be called    and buildings that consume slightly more energy than they produce are called  near-zero energy buildings  or  ultra-  
traditional buildings consume 40  of the total fossil fuel energy in the us and european union and are significant contributors of   the zero net energy consumption principle is viewed as a means to reduce
and reduce dependence on
and although zero-energy buildings remain uncommon even in   they are gaining importance and popularity 
most zero-energy buildings use the electrical grid for energy storage but some are independent of the grid  energy is usually harvested on-site through energy producing technologies like solar and wind  while reducing the overall use of energy with highly efficient
and lighting technologies  the zero-energy goal is becoming more practical as the costs of alternative energy technologies decrease and the costs of traditional fossil fuels increase 
the development of modern zero-energy buildings became possible not only through the progress made in new energy and construction technologies and techniques  but it has also been significantly improved by academic research  which collects precise energy performance data on traditional and experimental buildings and provides performance parameters for advanced computer models to predict the efficacy of engineering designs  zero-energy buildings can be part of a   some advantages of these buildings are as follows 
integration of renewable energy resources
integration of plug-in
implementation of zero-energy concepts
the net zero concept is applicable to a wide range of resources due to the many options for producing and
resources in buildings  e g  energy  water     energy is the first resource to be targeted because it is highly managed  expected to continually become more efficient  and the ability to distribute and allocate it will improve disaster resiliency

definitions  
despite sharing the name  zero net energy   there are several definitions of what the term means in practice  with a particular difference in usage between north america and europe 
zero net site energy use
in this type of zne  the amount of energy provided by on-site
sources is equal to the amount of energy used by the building  in the united states  zero net energy building generally refers to this type of building 
zero net source energy use
this zne generates the same amount of energy as is used  including the energy used to transport the energy to the building  this type accounts for losses during   these znes must generate more electricity than zero net site energy buildings 
net zero energy emissions
outside the
and   a zeb is generally defined as one with zero net energy emissions  also known as a zero carbon building or zero emissions building  under this definition the
generated from on-site or off-site fossil fuel use are balanced by the amount of on-site
production  other definitions include not only the carbon emissions generated by the building in use  but also those generated in the construction of the building and the
of the structure  others debate whether the carbon emissions of
to and from the building should also be included in the calculation recent work in new zealand has initiated an approach to include building user transport energy within zero energy building frameworks 
net zero cost
in this type of building  the cost of purchasing energy is balanced by income from sales of electricity to the grid of electricity generated on-site  such a status depends on how a utility credits net electricity generation and the utility rate structure the building uses 
net off-site zero energy use
a building may be considered a zeb if 100  of the energy it purchases comes from renewable energy sources  even if the energy is generated off the site 
off-the-grid
buildings are stand-alone zebs that are not connected to an off-site energy utility facility  they require distributed renewable energy generation and energy storage capability  for when the sun is not shining  wind is not blowing  etc    an energy
house is a building concept where the balance of the own energy consumption and production can be made on an hourly or even smaller basis  energy autarkic houses can be taken off-the-grid 
net zero-energy building
based on scientific analysis within the joint research program towards net zero energy solar buildings a methodological framework was set up which allows different definitions  in accordance with countrys political targets  specific  climate  conditions and respectively formulated requirements for indoor conditions  the overall conceptual understanding of a net zeb is an energy efficient  grid connected building enabled to generate energy from renewable sources to compensate its own energy demand  see figure 1
figure 1  the net zeb balance concept  balance of weighted energy import respectively energy demand  x-axis  and energy export  feed-in credits  respectively  on-site  generation  y-axis 
  
the wording net emphasizes the energy exchange between the building and the energy infrastructure  by the building-grid interaction  the net zebs becomes an active part of the renewable energy infrastructure  this connection to energy grids prevents seasonal energy storage and oversized on-site systems for energy generation from renewable sources like in energy autonomous buildings  the similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions  1  reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use  2  generate energy from renewable sources  however  the net zebs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands 
within this balance procedure several aspects and explicit choices have to be determined 
the building system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered  e g  in buildings footprint  on-site or even off-site  see  respectively how many buildings are included in the balance  single building  cluster of buildings  and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses  e g  heating  cooling  ventilation  hot water  lighting  appliances  it  central services  electric vehicles  and embodied energy  etc    it should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized  e g  by transportation or conversion effort  availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future  etc   and therefore create a hierarchy  it may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options 
the weighting system converts the physical units of different energy carriers into a uniform metric  site final energy  source primary energy renewable parts included or not  energy cost  equivalent carbon emissions and even energy or environmental credits  and allows their comparison and compensation among each other in one single balance  e g  exported pv electricity can compensate imported biomass   politically influenced and therefore possibly asymmetrically or time dependent conversion weighting factors can affect the relative value of energy carriers and can influence the required energy generation capacity 
the balancing period is often assumed to be one year  suitable to cover all operation energy uses   a shorter period  monthly or seasonal  could also be considered as well as a balance over the entire life cycle  including embodied energy  which could also be annualized and counted in addition to operational energy uses  
the energy balance can be done in two balance types  1  balance of delivered imported and exported energy  monitoring phase as self-consumption of energy generated on-site can be included   2  balance between  weighted  energy demand and  weighted  energy generation  for design phase as normally end users temporal consumption patterns -e g  for lighting  appliances  etc - are lacking   alternatively a balance based on monthly net values in which only residuals per month are summed up to an annual balance is imaginable  this can be seen either as a load generation balance or as a special case of import export balance where a virtual monthly self-consumption is assumed  see figure 2
figure 2  the net zeb balance concept  graphical representation of the different types of balance  import export balance between weighted exported and delivered energy  load generation balance between weighted generation and load  and monthly net balance between weighted monthly net values of generation and load
and compare  
beside the energy balance  net zebs can be characterized by their ability to match the building s load by its energy generation  load matching  or to work beneficially with respect to the needs of the local grid infrastructure  grind interaction   both can be expressed by suitable indicators which are intended as assessment tools only 
the information is based on the publications  and in which deeper information could be found 
design and construction  
the most cost-effective steps toward a reduction in a building s energy consumption usually occur during the design process  to achieve efficient energy use  zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice  successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested   or artificial conditioning  principles that work with the on-site assets  sunlight and solar heat  prevailing breezes  and the cool of the earth below a building  can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means  zebs are normally optimized to use
heat gain and shading  combined with
to stabilize
throughout the day  and in most climates are   all the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available
today 
sophisticated 3-d
tools are available to model how a building will perform with a range of design variables such as building orientation  relative to the daily and seasonal position of the    window and door type and placement  overhang depth  insulation type and values of the building elements  air tightness     the efficiency of heating  cooling  lighting and other equipment  as well as local climate  these simulations help the designers predict how the building will perform before it is built  and enable them to model the economic and financial implications on building   or even more appropriate  life cycle assessment 
zero-energy buildings are built with significant
features  the
and cooling loads are lowered by using high-efficiency equipment  added   high-efficiency windows  natural   and other techniques  these features vary depending on
in which the construction occurs  water heating loads can be lowered by using water conservation fixtures 
units on waste water  and by using solar water heating  and high-efficiency water heating equipment  in addition 
with
or solartubes can provide 100  of daytime illumination within the home  nighttime illumination is typically done with
and
lighting that use 1/3 or less power than incandescent lights  without adding unwanted heat  and
can be lessened by choosing efficient appliances and minimizing phantom loads or   other techniques to reach net zero  dependent on climate  are
principles  superinsulation walls using   vitruvianbuilt pre-fabricated building panels and roof elements plus exterior landscaping for seasonal shading 
zero-energy buildings are often designed to make dual use of energy including   for example  using
exhaust to heat domestic water  ventilation air and shower drain   office machines and computer servers  and body heat to heat the building  these buildings make use of heat energy that conventional buildings may exhaust outside  they may use       and
units   
energy harvest  
zebs harvest available energy to meet their electricity and heating or cooling needs  in the case of individual houses  various
technologies may be used to provide heat and electricity to the building  using
or
for electricity  and
or
linked to a
 stes  for space heating  an stes can also be used for summer cooling by storing the cold of winter underground  to cope with fluctuations in demand  zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the   export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus  and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced  other buildings may be fully  
energy harvesting is most often more effective  in cost and resource utilization  when done on a local but combined scale  for example  a group of houses    local district  village  etc  rather than an individual basis  an energy benefit of such localized energy harvesting is the virtual elimination of
and
losses  these losses amount to about 7.2 7.4  of the energy transferred  energy harvesting in
and
applications should benefit from the
of each location  the production of goods under net zero fossil energy consumption requires locations of       and
resources to sustain the concept 
zero-energy neighborhoods  such as the
development in the   and those that are spreading rapidly in
and   may use
schemes  this may in some cases include   community chilled water  shared wind turbines  etc  there are current plans to use zeb technologies to build entire off-the-grid or net zero energy use cities 
the  energy harvest  versus  energy conservation  debate  
one of the key areas of debate in zero energy building design is over the balance between
and the distributed point-of-use harvesting of
  
and    most zero energy homes use a combination of these strategies   
as a result of significant government subsidies for photovoltaic solar electric systems  wind turbines  etc   there are those who suggest that a zeb is a conventional house with distributed renewable energy harvesting technologies  entire additions of such homes have appeared in locations where photovoltaic  pv  subsidies are significant  but many so called  zero energy homes  still have utility bills  this type of energy harvesting without added energy conservation may not be cost effective with the current price of electricity generated with photovoltaic equipment  depending on the local price of power company electricity   and may also requires greater embodied energy and greater resources so be thus the less ecological approach   
since the 1980s 
and
have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70  to 90  in many locations  without active energy harvesting  for new builds  and with expert design  this can be accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building  very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design  such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building  a few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels  costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kwh production  u s  dollar equivalent  may only reduce external energy requirements by 15  to 30   a 100,000btu  110mj  high
14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kw of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating  and that does not include enough for
night-time operation    and superior system engineering techniques  can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70  to 90   photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower 
occupant behavior  
the energy used in a building can vary greatly depending on the behavior of its occupants  the acceptance of what is considered comfortable varies widely  studies of identical homes in the united states have shown dramatic differences in energy use  with some homes using more than twice the energy of others  occupant behavior can vary from differences in setting and programming   varying levels of
and hot water  and the amount of
or
used 
utility concerns  
utility companies are typically legally responsible for maintaining the electrical infrastructure that brings power to our cities  neighborhoods  and individual buildings  utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the property line of an individual parcel  and in some cases own electrical infrastructure on private land as well  utilities have expressed concern that the use of net metering for zne projects threatens the utilities base revenue  which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for  utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain net metering laws may saddle non-zne homes with higher utility costs  as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while zne home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve zne status  this creates potential equity issues  as currently  the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households  a possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum base charge for all homes connected to the utility grid  which would force zne home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use 
additional concerns exist that local distribution as well as larger transmission grids have not been designed to convey electricity in two directions  which may be necessary as higher levels of distributed energy generation come on line  overcoming this barrier could require extensive upgrades to the electrical grid  however this is not believed to be a major problem until renewable generation reaches much higher levels of penetration than currently realized 
development efforts  
wide acceptance of zero-energy building technology may require more government incentives or building code regulations  the development of recognized standards  or significant increases in the cost of conventional energy   
the google photovoltaic campus and the microsoft 480-kilowatt photovoltaic campus relied on u s  federal  and especially california  subsidies and financial incentives  california is now providing us 3.2 billion in subsidies for residential-and-commercial near-zero-energy buildings  due to california s serious electricity shortage  frequent   and
problems  the details of other american states  renewable energy subsidies  up to us 5.00 per watt  can be found in the database of state incentives for renewables and efficiency  the florida solar energy center has a slide presentation on recent progress in this area 
the world business council for sustainable development has launched a major initiative to support the development of zeb  led by the ceo of
and the chairman of   the organization has both the support of large global companies and the expertise to mobilize the corporate world and governmental support to make zeb a reality  their first report  a survey of key players in real estate and construction  indicates that the costs of building green are overestimated by 300 percent  survey respondents estimated that greenhouse gas emissions by buildings are 19 percent of the worldwide total  in contrast to the actual value of roughly 40 percent 
influential zero-energy and low-energy buildings  
those who commissioned construction of passive houses and zero-energy homes  over the last three decades  were essential to iterative  incremental  cutting-edge  technology innovations  much has been learned from many significant successes  and a few expensive failures 
the zero-energy building concept has been a progressive evolution from other
designs  among these  the canadian
and the
standards have been internationally influential  collaborative government demonstration projects  such as the superinsulated saskatchewan house  and the
  have also played their part 
net zero energy building definition  
the us national renewable energy lab  nrel  published a groundbreaking report titled net-zero energy buildings  a classification system based on renewable energy supply options  this is the first report to lay out a full spectrum classification system for net zero renewable energy buildings that includes the full spectrum of clean energy sources  both on site and off site  this classification system identifies the following 4 main categories of net zero energy buildings sites campuses 
nzeb a -- a footprint renewables net zero energy building
nzeb b -- a site renewables net zero energy building
nzeb c -- an imported renewables net zero energy building
nzeb d -- an off-site purchased renewables net zero energy building
applying this u s  government net zero classification system means that every building  can  become net zero with the right combination of the key net zero technologies - pv  solar   ghp  geothermal heating and cooling  thermal batteries   ee  energy efficiency   sometimes wind  and electric batteries  a graphical expos of the scale of impact of applying these nrel guidelines for net zero can be seen in the graphic at net zero foundation titled  net zero effect on u s  total energy use  showing a possible 39  u s  total fossil fuel use reduction by changing u s  residential and commercial buildings to net zero  37  savings if we still use nat  gas for cooking at the same level 
net zero carbon conversion example  
many well known universities have professed to want to completely convert their energy systems off of fossil fuels  the very idea that one could convert a whole campus off of fossil fuels has to date only been theoretical  capitalizing on the continuing developments in both
and
technologies  and in the advancing
field  complete conversion to a carbon free energy solution is now possible  an example of this is in the net zero foundation s proposal at mit to take that campus completely off fossil fuel use  this proposal shows the coming application of net zero energy buildings technologies at the
scale 
advantages and disadvantages  
advantages  
isolation for building owners from future energy price increases
increased comfort due to more-uniform interior temperatures  this can be demonstrated with comparative
maps 
reduced requirement for energy
reduced
due to improved
reduced total net monthly
reduced risk of loss from grid blackouts
improved reliability  photovoltaic systems have 25-year warranties and seldom fail during weather problems  the 1982 photovoltaic systems on the walt disney world epcot energy pavilion are still working fine today  after going through three recent hurricanes
extra cost is minimized for new construction compared to an afterthought retrofit
higher resale value as potential owners demand more zebs than available supply
the value of a zeb building relative to similar conventional building should increase every time energy costs increase
future legislative restrictions  and carbon emission taxes penalties may force expensive retrofits to inefficient buildings
disadvantages  
initial costs can be higher  effort required to understand  apply  and qualify for zeb subsidies  if they exist 
very few designers or builders have the necessary skills or experience to build zebs
possible declines in future utility company renewable energy costs may lessen the value of capital invested in energy efficiency
new
equipment technology price has been falling at roughly 17  per year  it will lessen the value of capital invested in a solar electric generating system  current subsidies will be phased out as photovoltaic mass production lowers future price
challenge to recover higher initial costs on resale of building  but new energy rating systems are being introduced gradually 
while the individual house may use an average of net zero energy over a year  it may demand energy at the time when peak demand for the grid occurs  in such a case  the capacity of the grid must still provide electricity to all loads  therefore  a zeb may not reduce the required power plant capacity 
without an optimised thermal envelope the embodied energy  heating and cooling energy and resource usage is higher than needed  zeb by definition do not mandate a minimum heating and cooling performance level thus allowing oversized renewable energy systems to fill the energy gap 
solar energy capture using the house envelope only works in locations unobstructed from the sun  the solar energy capture cannot be optimized in north  for northern hemisphere  or south for southern hemisphere  facing shade  or wooded surroundings 
zero energy building versus green building  
the goal of
and
is to use resources more efficiently and reduce a building s negative impact on the environment  zero energy buildings achieve one key green-building goal of completely or very significantly reducing energy use and
emissions for the life of the building  zero energy buildings may or may not be considered  green  in all areas  such as reducing waste  using
building materials  etc  however  zero energy  or net-zero buildings do tend to have a much lower ecological impact over the life of the building compared with other  green  buildings that require imported energy and or fossil fuel to be habitable and meet the needs of occupants 
because of the design challenges and sensitivity to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy  solar  wind  geothermal  etc    designers must apply holistic design principles  and take advantage of the free naturally occurring assets available  such as passive solar orientation  natural ventilation  daylighting  thermal mass  and night time cooling 
certification  
many
certification programs do not require a building to have net zero energy use  only to reduce energy use a few percentage points below the minimum required by law  green globes involves check lists that are measurement tools  not design tools  inexperienced designers or architects may cherry-pick points to meet a target certification level  even though those points may not be the best design choices for a specific building or climate    in november  2011  the international living future institute developed the net zero energy building certification  designed as part of the living building challenge  net zero energy building certification is simple  cost effective and critical for integrity and transparency
