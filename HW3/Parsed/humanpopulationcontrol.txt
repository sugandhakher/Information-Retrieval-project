human population planning is the practice of intentionally managing the rate of   historically human population planning has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of human population growth by reducing death rates  in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s  concerns about global population growth and its effects on  
and
led to efforts to reduce human population growth rates  while population planning can involve measures that improve people s lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction  a few programs  most notably the chinese government s     have resorted to coercive measures

population planning may use one or more of the following practices although there are other methods as well 
reducing
so that parents do not increase their family size to ensure at least some survive to adulthood 
changing
causing departure from traditional sexual division of labour 
and
policies  and other policies restricting or discouraging births directly 
role-model a small family as the norm
the method s  chosen can be strongly influenced by the religious and cultural beliefs of community members  the failure of other methods of population planning can lead to the use of abortion or
as solutions    while a specific population planning practice may be legal mandated in one country  it may be illegal or restricted in another  indicative of the controversy surrounding this topic 
history  
ancient times through middle ages  
a number of ancient writers have reflected on the issue of population  at about 300 bc  the indian
 c  350-283 bc  considered population a source of political  economic  and military strength  though a given region can house too many or too few people  he considered the latter possibility to be the greater evil  chanakya favored the remarriage of
 which at the time was forbidden in india   opposed taxes encouraging emigration  and believed in restricting
to the aged 
in  
 427-347 bc  and
 384-322 bc  discussed the best population size for greek
such as sparta  and concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation in public affairs  but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile neighbors  in order to maintain a desired population size  the philosophers advised that   and if necessary  immigration  should be encouraged if the population size was too small  emigration to colonies would be encouraged should the population become too large  aristotle concluded that a large increase in population would bring   certain poverty on the citizenry  and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil   to halt rapid population increase  aristotle advocated the use of
and the exposure of newborns  that is    
 551-478 bc  and other chinese writers cautioned that   excessive growth may reduce output per worker  repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife   confucius also observed that   mortality increases when food supply is insufficient  that premature marriage makes for high infantile mortality rates  that war checks population growth  
  especially in the time of
 63 bc- ad 14   needed manpower to acquire and administer the vast   a series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth  lex julia  18 bc  and the lex papia poppaea  ad 9  are two well known examples of such laws  which among others  provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those that complied with the laws  severe limitations were imposed on those who did not  for example  the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune  while the rest was taken by the state  these laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition 
  an early christian author  ca  ad 160-220   was one of the first to describe famine and war as factors that can prevent overpopulation  he wrote   the strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs  as our demands grow greater  our complaints against nature s inadequacy are heard by all  the scourges of pestilence  famine  wars and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations  since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race  
  a famous north african
 13321406   considered population changes to be connected to economic development  linking high birth rates and low death rates to times of economic upswing  and low birth rates and high death rates to economic downswing  khaldoun concluded that high
rather than high absolute population numbers were desirable to achieve more efficient division of labour and cheap administration 
during the
in christian europe  population issues were rarely discussed in isolation  attitudes were generally pro- in line with the
command   be ye fruitful and multiply  
16th and 17th centuries  
european cities grew more rapidly than before  and throughout the 16th century and early 17th century discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of population growth were frequent    an italian
  wrote   when every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that they can neither subsist where they are nor remove themselves elsewhere    the world will purge itself in one or another of these three ways   listing  
and  
concluded   god makes children  he is also going to feed them  
  a french
and
 15301596   argued that larger populations meant more production and more exports  increasing the wealth of a country    an italian priest and diplomat  15401617   emphasized that   the greatness of a city rests on the multitude of its inhabitants and their power   but pointed out that a population cannot increase beyond its food supply  if this limit was approached  late marriage  emigration  and war would serve to restore the balance 
  an english writer  15271616   observed that   throughe our longe peace and seldome sickness    wee are growen more populous than ever heretofore     many thousandes of idle persons are within this realme  which  havinge no way to be sett on worke  be either mutinous and seeke alteration in the state  or at leaste very burdensome to the commonwealthe   hakluyt believed that this led to crime and full jails and in a discourse on western planting  1584   hakluyt advocated for the emigration of the surplus population  with the onset of the
 161848   characterized by widespread devastation and deaths brought on by hunger and disease in europe  concerns about depopulation returned 
the population planning movement  
in the 20th century  population planning proponents have drawn from the insights of   a british clergyman and economist who published
in 1798  malthus argued that   population  when unchecked  increases in a
ratio 
increases only in an
ratio   he also outlined the idea of  positive checks  and  preventative checks    positive checks   such as diseases  war  disaster  famine  and genocide are factors that malthus considered to increase the death rate   preventative checks  were factors that malthus believed to affect the birth rate such as moral restraint  abstinence and birth control  he predicted that  positive checks  on
would ultimately save humanity from itself and that human misery was an  absolute necessary consequence   malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner 
there is a constant effort towards an increase in population which tends to subject the lower classes of society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition  the way in which these effects are produced seems to be this  we will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants  the constant effort towards population    increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased  the food  therefore which before supplied seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and half or eight millions  the poor consequently must live much worse  and many of them be reduced to severe distress 
finally  malthus advocated for the education of the lower class about the use of  moral restraint  or voluntary abstinence  which he believed would slow the growth rate 
  a us biologist and environmentalist  published
in 1968  advocating stringent population planning policies  his central argument on population is as follows 
a cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells  the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people  treating only the symptoms of cancer may make the victim more comfortable at first  but eventually he dies - often horribly  a similar fate awaits a world with a population explosion if only the symptoms are treated  we must shift our efforts from treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer  the operation will demand many apparent brutal and heartless decisions  the pain may be intense  but the disease is so far advanced that only with radical surgery does the patient have a chance to survive

in his concluding chapter  ehrlich offered a partial solution to the  population problem     we need  compulsory birth regulation     through  the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food  doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired family size  
ehrlich s views came to be accepted by many population planning advocates in the united states and europe in the 1960s and 1970s  since ehrlich introduced his idea of the  population bomb   overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues  including increasing poverty  high unemployment rates  environmental degradation  famine and genocide  in a 2004 interview  ehrlich reviewed the predictions in his book and found that while the specific dates within his predictions may have been wrong  his predictions about climate change and disease were valid  ehrlich continued to advocate for population planning and co-authored the book the population explosion  released in 1990 with his wife anne ehrlich 
however  it is controversial as to whether human population stabilization will avert environmental risks 
paige whaley eager argues that the shift in perception that occurred in the 1960s must be understood in the context of the demographic changes that took place at the time  it was only in the first decade of the 19th century that the world s population reached one billion  the second billion was added in the 1930s  and the next billion in the 1960s  90 percent of this net increase occurred in developing countries  eager also argues that  at the time  the
recognised that these demographic changes could significantly affect global geopolitics  large increases occurred in  
and   and demographers warned of a  population explosion   particularly in developing countries from the mid-1950s onwards 
in the 1980s  tension grew between population planning advocates and women s health activists who advanced women s
as part of a -based approach  growing opposition to the narrow population planning focus led to a significant change in population planning policies in the early 1990s   
population planning and economics  
opinions vary among economists about the effects of population change on a nation s economic health  us scientific research in 2009 concluded that the raising of a child cost about  16,000 yearly   291,570 total for raising the child to its 18th birthday   in the us  the multiplication of this number with the yearly population growth will yield the overall cost of the population growth  costs for other developed countries are usually of similar order of magnitude 
some economists  such as
and   have argued that poverty and famine are caused by bad government and bad economic policies  not by overpopulation 
in his book   economist
argued that higher population density leads to more
and   which in turn leads to a higher standard of living  he claimed that human beings are the ultimate resource since we possess  productive and inventive minds that help find creative solutions to mans problems  thus leaving us better off over the long run   he also claimed that   our species is better off in just about every measurable material way    
simon also claimed that when considering a list of   there is no correlation between population density and poverty and starvation    instead  if a list of countries is considered according to corruption within their respective governments  there is a significant correlation between government corruption  poverty and famine

said in his publication hereditary improvement   the unfit could become enemies to the state  if they continue to propagate   in 1968  paul ehrlich noted in    we must cut the cancer of population growth   and  if this was not done  there would be only one other solution  namely the  death rate solution  in which we raise the death rate through war-famine-pestilence etc 
in the same year  another prominent modern advocate for mandatory population planning was   who proposed in his landmark 1968 essay   society must relinquish the  freedom to breed  through  mutual coercion  mutually agreed upon   later on  in 1972  he reaffirmed his support in his new essay     by stating    we are breeding ourselves into oblivion   many prominent personalities  such as  
 1939    
 1952

have also advocated for population planning  today  a number of influential people advocate population planning such as these 
  uk sustainable development commissioner
  nobel laureate
the head of the un millennium project
is also a strong proponent of decreasing the effects of overpopulation  in 2007  jeffrey sachs gave a number of lectures  2007   about population planning and overpopulation  in his lectures  called     he featured an integrated approach that would deal with a number of problems associated with overpopulation and   for example  when criticized for advocating mosquito nets he argued that child survival was   by far one of the most powerful ways   to achieve fertility reduction  as this would assure poor families that the smaller number of children they had would survive 
opposition  
the roman catholic church
as a general practice but especially in regard to population planning policies   
has stated   the extermination of millions of unborn children  in the name of the fight against poverty  actually constitutes the destruction of the poorest of all human beings   population planning is usually associated with eugenics  which although most commonly thought of as the desire to eliminate undesirable inheritable traits from the populace  negative eugenics   it also refers to the encouragement of reproduction between individuals with positively viewed inheritable traits  positive eugenics  
present-day practice by countries  
china  
main article 
the most significant population planning system is china s   in which  with various exceptions  having more than one child is discouraged  unauthorized births are punished by fines  although there have also been allegations of illegal forced
and   as part of china s planned birth policy   work  unit supervisors monitor the fertility of married women and may decide whose turn it is to have a baby 
the chinese government introduced the policy in 1978 to alleviate the social and   according to government officials  the policy has helped prevent 400 million births  the success of the policy has been questioned  and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of china  the policy is controversial both within and outside of china because of its manner of implementation and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences e g    in oriental cultures  the oldest male child has responsibility of caring for the parents in their old age  therefore  it is common for oriental families to invest most heavily in the oldest male child  such as providing college  steering them into the most lucrative careers  and so on  to these families  having an oldest male child is paramount  so in a one-child policy  a daughter has no economic benefit  so daughters  especially as a first child  is often targeted for abortion or infanticide  china introduced several government reforms to increase retirement payments to coincide with the one-child policy  during that time  couples could request permission to have more than one child 
in november 2014  the chinese government allowed its people to conceive a second child under the supervision of government regulation 
on october 29  2015  the ruling communist party announced that all one-child policies would be abolished  allowing all couples to have two children  the change was needed to allow a better balance of male and female children  and to grow the young population to ease the problem of paying for the aging population
