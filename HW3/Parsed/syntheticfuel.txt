classification and principles  
the term  synthetic fuel  has several different meanings and it may include different types of fuels  more traditional definitions  e g  definition given by the   define  synthetic fuel  as any liquid fuel obtained from coal or natural gas  the
defines synthetic fuels in its annual energy outlook 2006  as fuels produced from coal  natural gas  or
through chemical conversion into
and or synthetic liquid products  a number of synthetic fuel s definitions include also fuels produced from biomass  and industrial and municipal waste  the definition of synthetic fuel also allows
and
as synthetic fuel sources  and in addition to liquid fuels  synthesized gaseous fuels are also considered to be synthetic fuels  in his  synthetic fuels handbook  petrochemist james g  speight included liquid and gaseous fuels as well as clean solid fuels produced by conversion of coal  oil shale or tar sands  and various forms of biomass  although he admits that in the context of substitutes for petroleum-based fuels it has even wider meaning  depending on the context   
and
may also be included 
synthetic fuels are produced by the chemical process of   conversion methods could be direct conversion into liquid transportation fuels  or indirect conversion  in which the source substance is converted initially into
which then goes through additional conversion process to become liquid fuels  basic conversion methods include

direct conversion of coal to synthetic fuel was originally developed in germany  the
was developed by   yielding a patent in 1913  karl goldschmidt invited him to build an industrial plant at his factory the
 now known as   in 1914  production began in 1919   
indirect coal conversion  where coal is gasified and then converted to synthetic fuels  was also developed in germany by
and
in 1923  during   germany used synthetic oil manufacturing    kohleverflssigung  to produce substitute    oil products by using the
 from coal   the
    and other methods   used the tth and mth processes   in 1931  the british
located in
set up a small facility where hydrogen gas was combined with coal at extremely high pressures to make a synthetic fuel 
the bergius process plants were nazi germany s primary source of high-grade aviation gasoline  synthetic oil    synthetic   synthetic   and   nearly one third of the bergius production was produced by plants in
   police  and   with 1/3 more in five other plants   had a much smaller bergius plant which improved  gasoline quality by dehydrogenation  using the dhd process  
synthetic fuel grades included  t l 
fuel    first quality aviation gasoline    aviation base gasoline   and  gasoline - middle oil   and  producer gas  and diesel were synthesized for fuel as well  e g   converted armored tanks used producer gas   4 s2 by early 1944  german synthetic fuel production had reached more than 124,000 barrels per day  19,700m3 d  from 25plants    including 10 in the   239 in 1937  the four central germany
coal plants at   leuna   rothensee  and zeitz  along with the
plant at scholven   had produced 4.8 million barrels  76010 3m3  of fuel  four new hydrogenation plants    hydrierwerke  were subsequently erected at -welheim  which used  bituminous
pitch   
 nordstern   plitz  and  at 200,000 tons yr   nordstern and plitz  used bituminous coal  as did the new
plants 
synthesized food oil  which was tested on
prisoners  the geilenberg special staff was using 350,000 mostly foreign
to reconstruct the bombed synthetic oil plants  210,224 and  in an emergency decentralization program  to build 7underground hydrogenation plants for bombing protection  none were completed    planners had rejected an earlier such proposal because the war was to be won before the
would be completed   in july 1944  the  cuckoo  project underground synthetic oil plant  800,000 m2  was being  carved out of the   north of the   but the plant was unfinished at the end of wwii 
indirect fischer-tropsch   ft   technologies were brought to the us after world war 2  and a 7,000 barrels per day  1,100m3 d  plant was designed by hri  and built in brownsville texas  the plant represented the first commercial use of high-temperature fischer tropsch conversion  it operated from 1950 to 1955  when it was shut down when the price of oil dropped due to enhanced production and huge discoveries in the middle east 
in 1949  a demonstration plant for converting coal to gasoline was built and operated by the u s  bureau of mines in   direct coal conversion plants were also developed in the us after world war ii  including a 3 tpd plant in   and a 250-600 tpd plant in

processes  
there are numerous processes that can be used to produce synthetic fuels 
these broadly fall into three categories  indirect  direct  and biofuel processes     
this is a listing of many of the different technologies used for synthetic fuel production  please note that although this list was compiled for coal to liquids technologies  many of the same processes can also be used with biomass or natural gas feedstocks 
indirect conversion  
indirect conversion has the widest deployment worldwide  with global production totaling around 260,000 barrels per day  41,000m3 d   and many additional projects under active development 
indirect conversion broadly refers to a process in which biomass  coal  or natural gas is converted to a mix of
and
known as syngas either through
or   and that syngas is processed into a liquid transportation fuel using one of a number of different conversion techniques depending on the desired end product 
the primary technologies that produce synthetic fuel from syngas are
synthesis and the
 also known as methanol to gasoline  or mtg   there are some technologies under development to produce ethanol from syngas  though these have not yet been demonstrated at commercial scale 
the fischer-tropsch process reacts syngas with typically a cobalt or iron-based catalyst  and transforms the gas into liquid products  primarily
and   and potentially waxes  depending on the ft process employed  
the process of producing synfuels through indirect conversion is often referred to as coal-to-liquids  ctl  
 gtl  or
 btl   depending on the initial feedstock  at least three projects  ohio river clean fuels  illinois clean fuels  and rentech natchez  are combining coal and biomass feedstocks  creating hybrid-feedstock synthetic fuels known as coal and biomass to liquids  cbtl  
indirect conversion process technologies can also be used to produce hydrogen  potentially for use in fuel cell vehicles  either as slipstream co-product  or as a primary output 
direct conversion  
direct conversion refers to processes in which coal or biomass feedstocks are converted directly into intermediate or final products  without going through the intermediate step of conversion to syngas via  
direct conversion processes can be broadly broken up into two different methods  pyrolysis and carbonization  and hydrogenation   
hydrogenation processes  
see also 
one of the main methods of direct conversion of coal to liquids by hydrogenation process is the bergius process  in this process  coal is liquefied by mixing it with hydrogen gas and heating the system  hydrogenation   dry coal is mixed with heavy oil recycled from the process 
is typically added to the mixture  the reaction occurs at between 400c  752f  to 500c  932f  and 20 to 70 hydrogen pressure  the reaction can be summarized as follows

after
several plants were built in germany  these plants were extensively used during
to supply germany with fuel and lubricants 
the kohleoel process  developed in germany by
and   was used in the demonstration plant with the capacity of 200ton of
per day  built in   germany  this plant operated from 1981 to 1987  in this process  coal is mixed with a recycle solvent and iron catalyst  after preheating and pressurizing  h2 is added  the process takes place in tubular reactor at the pressure of 300bar and at the temperature of 470c  880f   this process was also explored by
in south africa 
in 1970-1980s  japanese companies  
and
developed the nedol process  in this process  coal is mixed with a recycled solvent and a synthetic iron-based catalyst  after preheating h2 is added  the reaction takes place in tubular reactor at temperature between 430c  810f  and 465c  870f  at the pressure 150-200bar  the produced oil has low quality and requires intensive upgrading  h-coal process  developed by hydrocarbon research  inc   in 1963  mixes pulverized coal with recycled liquids  hydrogen and catalyst in the ebullated bed reactor  advantages of this process are that dissolution and oil upgrading are taking place in the single reactor  products have high h c ratio  and a fast reaction time  while the main disadvantages are high gas yield  high hydrogen consumption  and limitation of oil usage only as a boiler oil because of impurities 
the src-i and src-ii  solvent refined coal  processes were developed by
and implemented as pilot plants in the united states in the 1960s and 1970s  the nuclear utility services corporation developed hydrogenation process which was patented by wilburn c  schroeder in 1976  the process involved dried  pulverized coal mixed with roughly 1wt 
catalysts  hydrogenation occurred by use of high temperature and pressure syngas produced in a separate gasifier  the process ultimately yielded a synthetic crude product    a limited amount of c3 c4 gas  light-medium weight liquids  c5-c10  suitable for use as fuels  small amounts of nh3 and significant amounts of co2  other single-stage hydrogenation processes are the   the imhausen high-pressure process  and the conoco zinc chloride process 
there is also a number of two-stage direct liquefaction processes  however  after the 1980s only the catalytic two-stage liquefaction process  modified from the h-coal process  the liquid solvent extraction process by   and the brown coal liquefaction process of japan have been developed 
chevron corporation developed a process invented by joel w  rosenthal called the chevron coal liquefaction process  cclp   it is unique due the close-coupling of the non-catalytic dissolver and the catalytic
unit  the oil produced had properties that were unique when compared to other coal oils  it was lighter and had far fewer heteroatom impurities  the process was scaled-up to the 6 ton per day level  but not proven commercially 
pyrolysis and carbonization processes  
see also 
there are a number of different carbonization processes  the carbonization conversion occurs through
or   and it produces condensable   oil and water vapor  non-condensable   and a solid residue-  the condensed coal tar and oil are then further processed by hydrogenation to remove
and
species  after which they are processed into fuels 
the typical example of carbonization is the   the process was invented by
in the 1920s  the karrick process is a low-temperature
process  where coal is heated at 680f  360c  to 1,380f  750c  in the absence of air  these temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar  however  the produced liquids are mostly a by-product and the main product is semi-coke  a solid and smokeless fuel 
the coed process  developed by   uses a
for processing  in combination with increasing temperature  through four stages of pyrolysis  heat is transferred by hot gases produced by combustion of part of the produced char  a modification of this process  the cogas process  involves the addition of gasification of char  the toscoal process  an analogue to the
and   which is also used for the   uses hot recycled solids for the heat transfer 
liquid yields of pyrolysis and karrick processes are generally low for practical use for synthetic liquid fuel production  furthermore  the resulting liquids are of low quality and require further treatment before they can be used as motor fuels  in summary  there is little possibility that this process will yield economically viable volumes of liquid fuel 
biofuels processes  
one example of a biofuel-based synthetic fuel process is hydrotreated renewable jet  hrj  fuel  there are a number of variants of these processes under development  and the testing and certification process for hrj aviation fuels is beginning 
there are two such process under development by   one using solid biomass feedstocks  and one using
and fats  the process using solid second-generation biomass sources such as switchgrass or woody
uses pyrolysis to produce a bio-oil  which is then catalytically stabilized and deoxygenated to produce a jet-range fuel  the process using natural oils and fats goes through a deoxygenation process  followed by hydrocracking and isomerization to produce a renewable synthetic paraffinic kerosene jet fuel 
oil sand and oil shale processes

and
may also be created by
 a tar like substance found in    or synthesizing liquid
from oil shale  there are number of processes
 synthetic crude oil  from
by pyrolysis  hydrogenation  or thermal dissolution 
commercialization  
main article 
worldwide commercial synthetic fuels plant capacity is over 240,000 barrels per day  38,000m3 d   including indirect conversion fischer tropsch plants in south africa       qatar     and
 shell bintulu   and a mobil process  methanol to gasoline  plant in new zealand 
the leading company in the commercialization of synthetic fuel is   a company based in   sasol operates the world s only commercial fischer tropsch coal-to-liquids facility at   with a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day  24,000m3 d  
numerous large projects are under construction in china and qatar  some analysts believe that chinese ctl production will exceed that of south africa by 2015  and new and existing gtl capacity in qatar should also exceed the july 2009 south african production level some time in 2011 
economics  
the economics of synthetic fuel manufacture vary greatly depending the feedstock used  the precise process employed  site characteristics such as feedstock and transportation costs  and the cost of additional equipment required to control emissions  the examples described below indicate a wide range of production costs between  20  for large-scale gas-to-liquids  to as much as  240 bbl for small-scale biomass-to-liquids   carbon capture and sequestration 
in order to be economically viable  projects must do much better than just being competitive head-to-head with oil  they must also generate a sufficient return on investment to justify the capital investment in the project 
gtl economics  
a synthetic fuel manufactured from natural gas  gtl   without ccs  in a large scale plant in the middle east  where gas is relatively inexpensive   is expected  as of 2005  to be competitive with oil down to approximately  20 per barrel 
recent advances by the oil company shell have seen synthetic fuels start to become profitable  the company built a gtl  gas-to-liquid  plant in qatar  inaugurated in 2011  it was to be capable of producing 300,000 barrels per day  48,000m3 d  of synthetic fuels and other products  using natural gas as a feedstock 
ctl cbtl btl economics  
according to a december 2007 study  a medium scale  30,000 bpd  coal-to-liquids plant  ctl  sited in the us using bituminous coal  is expected to be competitive with oil down to roughly  5256 bbl crude-oil equivalent  adding carbon capture and sequestration to the project was expected to add an additional  10 bbl to the required selling price  though this may be offset by revenues from   or by tax credits  or the eventual sale of carbon credits 
a recent netl study examined the relative economics of a number of different process configurations for the production of indirect ft fuels using biomass  coal  and ccs  this study determined a price at which the plant would not only be profitable  but also make a sufficient return to yield a 20  return on the equity investment required to build the plant 
this chapter details an analysis which derives the required selling price  rsp  of the ft diesel fuels produced in order to determine the economic feasibility and relative competitiveness of the different plant options  a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how carbon control regulations such as an emissions trading scheme for transportation fuels would affect the price of both petroleum-derived diesel and ft diesel from the different plants  the key findings of these analyses were   1  ctl plants equipped with ccs are competitive at crude oil prices as low as  86 per barrel and have less life cycle ghg emissions than petroleum-derived diesel  these plants become more economically competitive as carbon prices increase   2  the incremental cost of adding simple ccs is very low  7 cents per gallon  because co2 capture is an inherent part of the ft process  this becomes the economically preferred option at carbon prices above  5 mtco2eq 27  3  btl systems are hindered by limited biomass availability which affects the maximum plant size  thereby limiting potential economies of scale  this  combined with relatively high biomass costs results in ft diesel prices which are double that of other configurations   6.45 to  6.96 gal compared to  2.56 to  2.82 gal for ctl and 15wt  cbtl systems equipped with ccs 
the conclusion reached based on these findings was that both the ctl with ccs and the 8wt  to 15wt  cbtl with ccs configurations may offer the most pragmatic solutions to the nations energy strategy dilemma  ghg emission reductions which are significant  5  to 33  below the petroleum baseline  at diesel rsps that are only half as much as the btl options   2.56 to  2.82 per gallon compared to  6.45 to  6.96 per gallon for btl   these options are economically feasible when crude oil prices are  86 to  95 per barrel 
these economics can change in the event that plentiful low-cost biomass sources can be found  lowing the cost of biomass inputs  and improving economies of scale 
economics for solid feedstock indirect ft process plants are further confused by carbon regulation  generally  since permitting a ctl plant without ccs will likely be impossible  and ctl ccs plants have a lower carbon footprint than conventional fuels  carbon regulation is expected to be balance-positive for synthetic fuel production  but it impacts the economics of different process configurations in different ways  the netl study picked a blended cbtl process using 5-15  biomass alongside coal as the most economical in a range of carbon price and probable future regulation scenarios  unfortunately  because of scale and cost constraints  pure btl processes did not score well until very high carbon prices were assumed  though again this may improve with better feedstocks and more efficient larger scale projects 
chinese direct coal liquefaction economics  
shenhua group recently reported that their direct coal liquefaction process is competitive with oil prices above  60 per barrel   previous reports have indicated an anticipated cost of production of less than  30 per barrel  based on a direct coal liquefaction process  and a coal mining cost of under  10 ton  in october 2011  actual price of coal in china was as high as  135 ton 
security considerations  
a central consideration for the development of synthetic fuel is the security factor of securing domestic fuel supply from domestic biomass and coal  nations that are rich in biomass and coal can use synthetic fuel to off-set their use of petroleum derived fuels and foreign oil 
environmental considerations  
the environmental footprint of a given synthetic fuel varies greatly depending on which process is employed  what feedstock is used  what pollution controls are employed  and what the transportation distance and method are for both feedstock procurement and end-product distribution 
in many locations  project development will not be possible due to permitting restrictions if a process design is chosen that does not meet local requirements for clean air  water  and increasingly  lifecycle carbon emissions 
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions  
among different indirect ft synthetic fuels production technologies  potential emissions of greenhouse gasses vary greatly 
  ctl   without
  ccs   is expected to result in a significantly higher carbon footprint than conventional petroleum-derived fuels   147    on the other hand  biomass-to-liquids with ccs could deliver a 358  reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions  both of these plants fundamentally use
and ft conversion synthetic fuels technology  but they deliver wildly divergent environmental footprints   
lifecycle carbon emissions profiles of various fuels  including many synthetic fuels  coal and biomass co-conversion to transportation fuels  michael e  reed  doe netl office of fossil energy  oct 17 2007
generally  ctl without ccs has a higher greenhouse gas footprint  ctl with ccs has a 9-15  reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to that of petroleum derived diesel 
cbtl ccs plants that blend biomass alongside coal while sequestering carbon do progressively better the more biomass is added  depending on the type of biomass  the assumptions about root storage  and the transportation logistics  at conservatively 40  biomass alongside coal  cbtl ccs plants achieve a neutral lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint  at more than 40  biomass  they begin to go lifecycle negative  and effectively store carbon in the ground for every gallon of fuels that they produce 
ultimately btl plants employing ccs could store massive amounts of carbon while producing transportation fuels from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks  although there are a number of significant economic hurdles  and a few technical hurdles that would have to be overcome to enable the development of such facilities 
serious consideration must also be given to the type and method of feedstock procurement for either the coal or biomass used in such facilities  as reckless development could exacerbate environmental problems caused by   land use change  fertilizer runoff 
concerns  or many other potential factors  or they could not  depending entirely on project-specific factors on a plant-by-plant basis   
a study from u s  department of energy national energy technology laboratory with much more in-depth information of cbtl life-cycle emissions  affordable low carbon diesel from domestic coal and biomass  
hybrid hydrogen-carbon processes have also been proposed recently as another closed-carbon cycle alternative  combining   recycled co  h2 and captured co2 with biomass as inputs as a way of reducing the biomass needed   
fuels emissions  
the fuels produced by the various synthetic fuels process also have a wide range of potential environmental performance  though they tend to be very uniform based on the type of synthetic fuels process used  i e  the tailpipe emissions characteristics of fischer tropsch diesel tend to be the same  though their lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint can vary substantially based on which plant produced the fuel  depending on feedstock and plant level sequestration considerations    
in particular  fischer tropsch diesel and jet fuels deliver dramatic across-the-board reductions in all major criteria pollutants such as sox  nox  particulate matter  and hydrocarbon emissions  these fuels  because of their high level of purity and lack of contaminants  further enable the use of advanced emissions control equipment that has been shown to virtually eliminate hc  co  and pm emissions from diesel vehicles 
in testimony before the subcommittee on energy and environment of the u s  house of representatives the following statement was made by a senior scientist from rentech 
f-t fuels offer numerous benefits to aviation users  the first is an immediate reduction in particulate emissions  f-t jet fuel has been shown in laboratory combusters and engines to reduce pm emissions by 96  at idle and 78  under cruise operation  validation of the reduction in other turbine engine emissions is still under way  concurrent to the pm reductions is an immediate reduction in co2 emissions from f-t fuel  f-t fuels inherently reduce co2 emissions because they have higher energy content per carbon content of the fuel  and the fuel is less dense than conventional jet fuel allowing aircraft to fly further on the same load of fuel 
the cleanliness of these ft synthetic fuels is further demonstrated by the fact that they are sufficiently non-toxic and environmentally benign as to be considered biodegradable  this owes primarily to the near-absence of sulfur and extremely low level of aromatics present in the fuel 
using fischer tropsch diesel results in dramatic across the board tailpipe emissions reductions relative to conventional fuels
using fischer tropsch jet fuels have been proven to dramatically reduce particulate and other aircraft emissions
sustainability  
one concern commonly raised about the development of synthetic fuels plants is sustainability  fundamentally  transitioning from oil to coal or natural gas for transportation fuels production is a transition from one inherently depletable geologically limited resource to another 
one of the positive defining characteristics of synthetic fuels production is the ability to use multiple feedstocks  coal  gas  or biomass  to produce the same product from the same plant  in the case of hybrid bctl plants  some facilities are already planning to use a significant biomass component alongside coal  ultimately  given the right location with good biomass availability  and sufficiently high oil prices  synthetic fuels plants can be transitioned from coal or gas  over to a 100  biomass feedstock  this provides a path forward towards a renewable fuel source and possibly more sustainable  even if the plant originally produced fuels solely from coal  making the infrastructure forwards-compatible even if the original fossil feedstock runs out   
some synthetic fuels processes can be converted to sustainable production practices more easily than others  depending on the process equipment selected  this is an important design consideration as these facilities are planned and implemented  as additional room must be left in the plant layout to accommodate whatever future plant change requirements in terms of materials handling and gasification might be necessary to accommodate a future change in production profile
