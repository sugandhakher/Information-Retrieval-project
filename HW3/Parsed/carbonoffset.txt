carbon offset
a carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or
made in order to compensate for or to offset an emission made elsewhere 
carbon offsets are measured in metric tons of
 co2e  and may represent six primary categories of greenhouse gases 
 co2  
 ch4  
 n2o  
 pfcs  
 hfcs   and
 sf6   one carbon offset represents the reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases 
there are two markets for carbon offsets  in the larger  compliance market  companies  governments  or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with
on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit  this market exists in order to achieve compliance with obligations of annex 1 parties under the   and of liable entities under the   in 2006  about  5.5 billion of carbon offsets were purchased in the compliance market  representing about 1.6 billion metric tons of co2e reductions 
in the much smaller  voluntary market  individuals  companies  or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from transportation  electricity use  and other sources  for example  an individual might purchase carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel  many companies  see list  offer carbon offsets as an up-sell during the sales process so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase  such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight  car rental  hotel stay  consumer good  etc    in 2008  about  705 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market  representing about 123.4 million metric tons of co2e reductions  some fuel suppliers in the uk offer fuel which has been carbon offset such as  
offsets are typically achieved through financial support of projects that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the short- or long-term  the most common project type is   such as wind farms  biomass energy  or hydroelectric dams  others include energy efficiency projects  the destruction of industrial pollutants or agricultural byproducts  destruction of landfill methane  and forestry projects  some of the most popular carbon offset projects from a corporate perspective are energy efficiency and wind turbine projects 
carbon offsetting has gained some appeal and momentum mainly among consumers in western countries who have become aware and concerned about the potentially negative environmental effects of energy-intensive lifestyles and economies  the
has sanctioned offsets as a way for governments and private companies to earn
that can be traded on a marketplace  the protocol established the
 cdm   which validates and measures projects to ensure they produce authentic benefits and are genuinely  additional  activities that would not otherwise have been undertaken  organizations that are unable to meet their emissions quota can offset their emissions by buying cdm-approved certified emissions reductions  emissions from burning fuel  such as red diesel  has pushed one uk fuel supplier to create a carbon offset fuel named  
offsets may be cheaper or more convenient alternatives to reducing one s own fossil-fuel consumption  however  some critics object to carbon offsets  and question the benefits of certain types of offsets 
is recommended to help businesses in the assessment and identification of  good quality  offsets to ensure offsetting provides the desired additional environmental benefits  and to avoid reputational risk associated with poor quality offsets 
offsets are viewed as an important policy tool to maintain stable economies and to improve sustainability  one of the hidden dangers of climate change policy is unequal prices of carbon in the economy  which can cause economic collateral damage if production flows to regions or industries that have a lower price of carbonunless carbon can be purchased from that area  which offsets effectively permit  equalizing the price

projects are the most common source of carbon offsets 
contents
definitions  
features  
carbon offsets have several common features 
vintage  the vintage is the year in which the carbon reduction takes place 
source  the source refers to the project or technology used in offsetting the carbon emissions  projects can include land-use  methane  biomass  renewable energy and industrial energy efficiency  projects may also have secondary benefits  co-benefits   for example  projects that reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions may improve water quality by reducing fertilizer usage 
certification regime  the certification regime describes the systems and procedures that are used to certify and register carbon offsets  different methodologies are used for measuring and verifying emissions reductions  depending on project type  size and location  for example  the cdm uses another  in the voluntary market  a variety of industry standards exist  these include the
and the
that are implemented to provide third-party verification of carbon offset projects  there are some additional standards for the validation of co-benefits  including the ccbs  issued by the
and the social carbon standard  issued by ecologica institute 
carbon offset markets  
global market  
in 2009  8.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent changed hands worldwide  up 68 per cent from 2008  according to the study by carbon-market research firm point carbon  of washington and oslo  but at eur94 billion  or about  135 billion  the market s value was nearly unchanged compared with 2008  with world carbon prices averaging eur11.40 a ton  down about 40 per cent from the previous year  according to the study  the world bank s  state and trends of the carbon market 2010  put the overall value of the market at  144 billion  but found that a significant part of this figure resulted from manipulation of a vat loophole 
 90  of voluntary offset volumes were contracted by the private sector  where corporate social responsibility and industry leadership were primary motivations for offset purchases 
 offset buyers desire to positively impact the climate resilience of their supply chain or sphere of influence was evident in our data which identifies a strong relationship between buyers business sectors and the project categories from which they contract offsets 
e u  market  
the global carbon market is dominated by the   where companies that emit greenhouse gases are required to cut their emissions or buy pollution allowances or carbon credits from the market  under the
 eu ets   europe  which has seen volatile carbon prices due to fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand  will continue to dominate the global carbon market for another few years  as the u s  and chinathe world s top pollutershave yet to establish mandatory emission-reduction policies 
u s  market  
on the whole  the u s  market remains primarily a voluntary market  but multiple cap and trade regimes are either fully implemented or near-imminent at the regional level  the first mandatory  market-based cap-and-trade program to cut co2 in the u s   called the
 rggi   kicked into gear in northeastern states in 2009  growing nearly tenfold to  2.5 billion  according to  
 wci a regional cap-and-trade program including seven western states  california notably among them  and four canadian provinceshas established a regional target for reducing heat-trapping emissions of 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020  a component of california s own   kicked off in early 2013  requires high-emissions industries to purchase carbon credits to cover emissions in excess of 25,000 co2 metric tons 
voluntary market  
participants
a wide range of participants are involved in the voluntary market  including providers of different types of offsets  developers of quality assurance mechanisms  third party verifiers  and consumers who purchase offsets from domestic or international providers  suppliers include for-profit companies  governments  charitable non-governmental organizations  colleges and universities  and other groups 
motivations
according to industry analyst   the voluntary markets present the opportunity for citizen consumer action  as well as an alternative source of carbon finance and an incubator for carbon market innovation  in their survey of voluntary markets  data has shown that    and  public relations branding  are clearly in first place among motivations for voluntary offset purchases  with evidence indicating that companies seek to offset emissions  for goodwill  both of the general public and their investors  
in addition  regarding market composition  research indicates   though many analysts perceive pre-compliance buying as a dominant driving force in the voluntary market  the results of our survey have repeatedly indicated that precompliance motives  as indicated by  investment resale and  anticipation of regulation   remain secondary to those of the pure voluntary market  companies individuals offsetting their emissions   
pre-compliance   trading
the other main category of buyers on the voluntary markets are those engaged in pre-compliance and or trading  those purchasing offsets for pre-compliance purposes are doing so with the expectation  or as a hedge against the possibility  of future mandatory cap and trade regulations  as a mandatory cap would sharply increase the price of offsets  firmsespecially those with large carbon footprints and the corresponding financial exposure to regulationmake the decision to acquire offsets in advance at what are expected to be lower prices 
the trading market in offsets in general resembles the trade in other commodities markets  with financial professionals including hedge funds and desks at major investment banks  taking positions in the hopes of buying cheap and selling dear  with their motivation typically short or medium term financial gain 
retail
multiple players in the retail market have offerings that enable consumers and businesses to calculate their   most commonly through a web-based interface including a calculator or questionnaire  and sell them offsets in the amount of that footprint  in addition many companies selling products and services  especially carbon-intensive ones such as airline travel  offer options to bundle a proportional offsetting amount of carbon credits with each transaction 
suppliers of voluntary offsets operate under both
and
models  or a blended approach sometimes referred to as   other suppliers include broader environmentally focused organizations with website subsections or initiatives that enable retail voluntary offset purchases by members  and government created projects 
features of companies that voluntarily offset emissions
companies that voluntarily offset their own emissions tend to be of relatively low   as they can offset a significant proportion of their emissions at relatively low cost  voluntary offsetting is particularly common in the financial sector  61 per cent of financial companies in the ftse 100 offset at least a portion of their 2009 emissions  twenty-two per cent of financial companies in the ftse 100 considered their entire 2009 operations to be carbon neutral 
sources of carbon offsets  
the cdm identifies over 200 types of projects suitable for generating carbon offsets  which are grouped into broad categories  these project types include renewable energy  methane abatement  energy efficiency  reforestation and fuel switching 
renewable energy  
offsets commonly include    
and   some of these offsets are used to reduce the cost differential between renewable and conventional energy production  increasing the commercial viability of a choice to use renewable energy sources 
 recs  are also sometimes treated as carbon offsets  although the concepts are distinct  whereas a carbon offset represents a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  a rec represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources  to convert recs into offsets  the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions  typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally produced electricity from the local grid  this is known as an indirect offset  because the reduction doesn t take place at the project site itself  but rather at an external site   and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to  additional  emission reductions and who should get credit for any reductions that may occur  intel corporation is the largest purchaser of renewable power in the us 
methane collection and combustion  
some offset projects consist of the combustion or containment of
generated by farm animals  by use of an    landfills or other industrial waste  methane has a
 gwp  23 times that of co2  when combusted  each molecule of methane is converted to one molecule of co2  thus reducing the global warming effect by 96  
an example of a project using an
can be found in chile where in december 2000  the largest pork production company in chile  initiated a voluntary process to implement advanced waste management systems  anaerobic and aerobic digestion of hog manure   in order to reduce greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions

while carbon offsets that fund renewable energy projects help lower the
of energy supply  energy conservation projects seek to reduce the overall demand for energy  carbon offsets in this category fund projects of several types 
plants generate both electricity and heat from the same power source  thus improving upon the energy efficiency of most power plants  which waste the energy generated as heat 
fuel efficiency projects replace a combustion device with one using less fuel per unit of energy provided  assuming energy demand does not change  this reduces the carbon dioxide emitted 
reduce the amount of energy wasted in buildings through efficient heating  cooling or lighting systems  in particular  the replacement of incandescent
with
can have a drastic effect on energy consumption  new buildings can also be constructed using less carbon-intensive input materials 
destruction of industrial pollutants  
industrial pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs  and perfluorocarbons  pfcs  have a
many thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide by volume  because these pollutants are easily captured and destroyed at their source  they present a large and low-cost source of carbon offsets  as a category  hfcs  pfcs  and n2o reductions represent 71 per cent of offsets issued under the cdm 
land use  land-use change and forestry  
land use  land-use change and forestry    projects focus on natural
such as forests and soil  deforestation  particularly in brazil  indonesia and parts of africa  account for about 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions  deforestation can be avoided either by paying directly for forest preservation  or by using offset funds to provide substitutes for forest-based products  there is a class of mechanisms referred to as redd schemes     which may be included in a post-kyoto agreement  redd credits provide carbon offsets for the protection of forests  and provide a possible mechanism to allow funding from developed nations to assist in the protection of native forests in developing nations 
almost half of the world s people burn wood  or fiber or   for their cooking and heating needs    fuel-efficient cook stoves can reduce fuel wood consumption by 30 to 50   though the warming of the earth due to decreases in particulate matter  i e  smoke  from such fuel-efficient stoves has not been addressed  there are a number of different types of lulucf projects 
avoided
is the protection of existing forests 
is the process of restoring forests on land that was once forested 
is the process of creating forests on land that was previously unforested  typically for longer than a generation 
projects attempt to preserve or increase the amount of carbon sequestered in soil 
purchase of carbon allowances from emissions trading schemes  
voluntary purchasers can offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon allowances from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs such as the
or the european   by purchasing the allowances that power plants  oil refineries  and industrial facilities need to hold to comply with a cap  voluntary purchases tighten the cap and force additional emissions reductions 
voluntary purchases can also be made through small-scale and sometimes uncertified schemes such as those offered at south african based promoting access to carbon equity centre  pace   which nevertheless offer clear services such as poverty alleviation in the form of renewable energy development  also  as  easy carbon credits are coming to an end   these projects have the potential to develop projects that are either too small or too complicated to benefit from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs 
links with emission trading schemes  
main article 
once it has been accredited by the
a carbon offset project can be used as
and linked with official emission trading schemes  such as the
or   as   european emission allowances for the 20082012 second phase were selling for between 21 and 24 euros per metric ton of co2 as of july 2007 
the voluntary
also includes a carbon offset scheme that allows offset project developers to sell emissions reductions to ccx members who have voluntarily agreed to meet emissions reduction targets 
the   a regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative by states and provinces along the western rim of north america  includes an offset scheme  likewise  the   a similar program in the northeastern u s   includes an offset program  a credit mechanism that uses offsets may be incorporated in proposed schemes such as the australian carbon exchange 
other  
a uk offset provider set up a carbon offsetting scheme that set up a secondary market for
in developing countries  these pumps are used by farmers  using human power  in place of
pumps  however  given that treadle pumps are best suited to pumping shallow water  while diesel pumps are usually used to pump water from deep boreholes  it is not clear that the treadle pumps are actually achieving real emissions reductions  other companies have explored and rejected treadle pumps as a viable carbon offsetting approach due to these concerns 
carbon retirement  
involves retiring allowances from
as a method for offsetting carbon emissions  under schemes such as the   eu emission allowances  euas   which represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  are issued to all the largest polluters  the theory is that by buying these allowances and permanently removing them  the price of euas increases and provides an incentive for industrial companies to reduce their emissions 
accounting for and verifying reductions  
due to their indirect nature  many types of offset are difficult to verify  some providers obtain independent certification that their offsets are accurately measured  to distance themselves from potentially fraudulent competitors  the credibility of the various certification providers is often questioned  certified offsets may be purchased from commercial or non-profit organizations for us 2.7599.00 per
of co2  due to fluctuations of market price 
in developed countries range from 6 to 23 tons per capita 
accounting systems differ on precisely what constitutes a valid offset for voluntary reduction systems and for mandatory reduction systems  however formal standards for quantification exist based on collaboration between emitters  regulators  environmentalists and project developers  these standards include the   green-e climate  chicago climate exchange and the   the latter of which expands upon the requirements for the
of the  
accounting of offsets may address the following basic areas 
baseline and measurementwhat emissions would occur in the absence of a proposed project  and how are the emissions that occur after the project is performed going to be measured 
additionalitywould the project occur anyway without the investment raised by selling carbon offset credits  there are two common reasons why a project may lack additionality   a  if it is intrinsically financially worthwhile due to energy cost savings  and  b  if it had to be performed due to environmental laws or regulations 
permanenceare some benefits of the reductions reversible   for example  trees may be harvested to burn the wood  and does growing trees for fuel wood decrease the need for    if woodlands are increasing in area or density  then   after roughly 50 years  newly planted forests will reach maturity and
more slowly 
does implementing the project cause higher emissions outside the project boundary 
co-benefits  
overall  carbon offsets improve the environment by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the earths atmosphere  offset projects often also lead to a number of co-benefits such as better air and water quality  and healthier communities 
while the primary goal of carbon offsets is to reduce global carbon emissions  many offset projects also claim to lead to improvements in the quality of life for a local population  these additional improvements are termed co-benefits  and may be considered when evaluating and comparing carbon offset projects  some possible co-benefits from a project that replaces wood-burning stoves with ovens using a less carbon-intensive fuel include 
lower nongreenhouse gas pollution  smoke  ash  and chemicals   which improves health in the home 
better preservation of forests  which are an important habitat for wildlife 
in a recent survey conducted by ecosecurities  conservation international  ccba and climatebiz  of the 120 corporates surveyed more than 77 per cent rated community and environmental benefits as the prime motivator for purchasing carbon offsets 
carbon offset projects can also negatively affect quality of life  for example  people who earn their livelihoods from collecting firewood and selling it to households could become unemployed if firewood is no longer used  a paper from the
offers some indicators to be used in assessing the potential developmental impacts of voluntary carbon offset schemes 
what potential does the project have for income generation 
what effects might a project have on future changes in land use and could conflicts arise from this 
can small-scale producers engage in the scheme 
what are the  add on  benefits to the countryfor example  will it assist capacity-building in local institutions 
putting a price on carbon encourages innovation by providing funding for new ways to reduce greenhouse gases in many sectors  carbon reduction goals drive the demand for offsets and carbon trading  encouraging the development of this new industry and offering opportunities for different sectors to develop and use innovative new technologies 
carbon offset projects also provide savings  energy efficiency measures may reduce fuel or electricity consumption  leading to a potential reduction in maintenance and operating costs 
quality assurance schemes  
quality assurance standard for carbon offsetting  qas   
in an effort to inform and safeguard business and household consumers purchasing carbon offsets  in 2009  the
has launched a scheme for regulating carbon offset products 
have created the  approved carbon offsetting  brand to use as an endorsement on offsets approved by the uk government  the scheme sets standards for best practice in offsetting  approved offsets have to demonstrate the following criteria 
accurate calculation of emissions to be offset
use of good quality carbon credits i e  initially those that are kyoto compliant
cancellation of carbon credits within a year of the consumers purchase of the offset
clear and transparent pricing of the offset
provision of information about the role of offsetting in tackling climate change and advice on how a consumer can reduce his or her carbon footprint
the first company to qualify for the scheme was   followed by carbon footprint  carbon passport  pure 
and  
on 20 may 2011 the
announced that the quality assurance scheme would close on 30 june 2011  the stated purpose of the quality assurance scheme was  to provide a straightforward route for those wishing to offset their emissions to identify quality offsets   critics of the closure therefore argued that without the scheme  businesses and individuals would struggle to identify quality carbon offsets 
in 2012 the scheme was relaunched as the quality assurance standard  qas   the qas is now run independently by quality assurance standard ltd which is a company limited by guarantee based in the united kingdom  the quality assurance standard is a comprehensive independent audit system for carbon offsets  approved offsets are checked against a 40-point checklist to ensure they meet the very highest standards in the world 
on 17 july 2012  the first organisations were approved as meeting the new qas 
australian government national carbon offset program  
the australian government is currently in a consultation period on the regulation of carbon offsets  on 20 december 2013  the australian government released the emissions reduction fund green paper outlining its preferred design options for the emissions reduction fund  a carbon buy-back model  the government invites public comment and written submissions on the green paper by 5pm on friday 21 february 2014 
controversies  
this article s criticism or controversy section may compromise the article s
of the subject  please
into the article as a whole  or rewrite the material   may 2013 
project-offsetting  
less than 30 pence in every pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes directly to projects designed to reduce emissions  the figures reported by the bbc and based on un data reported that typically 28p goes to the set up and maintenance costs of an environmental project  34p goes to the company that takes on the risk that the project may fail  the project s investors take 19p  with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits  in that respect carbon offsets are similar to most consumer products  with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers  the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets  who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas 
indulgence controversy  
some activists disagree with the principle of carbon offsets  likening them to roman catholic   a way for the guilty to pay for absolution rather than changing their behavior    an english environmentalist and writer  says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution  proponents hold that the indulgence analogy is flawed because they claim carbon offsets actually reduce carbon emissions  changing the business as usual  and therefore address the root cause of climate change  proponents of offsets claim that third-party certified carbon offsets are leading to increased investment in renewable energy  energy efficiency  methane biodigesters and reforestation and avoided deforestation projects    and claim that these alleged effects are the intended goal of carbon offsets  on october 16  2009   once a strong voice in favour of carbon offsetting  announced that it would stop offering carbon offsetting to its clients  stating that  too often offsets are being used by the tourism industry in developed countries to justify growth plans on the basis that money will be donated to projects in developing countries  global reduction targets will not be met this way  
on 4 february 2010  travel networking site vida loca travel announced that they would donate 5 per cent of profits to international medical corps  as they feel that international aid can be more effective at cutting global warming in the long term than carbon offsetting  citing the work of economist  
effectiveness of tree-planting offsets  
some environmentalists have questioned the effectiveness of
for carbon offset purposes  critics point to the following issues with tree planting projects 
timing  trees reach maturity over a course of many decades  project developers and offset retailers typically pay for the project and sell the promised reductions up-front  a practice known as  forward selling  
permanence  it is difficult to guarantee the permanence of the forests  which may be susceptible to clearing  burning  or mismanagement  the well-publicized instance of the  coldplay forest   in which a forestry project supported by the british band
resulted in a grove of dead mango trees  illustrates the difficulties of guaranteeing the permanence of tree-planting offsets  when discussing  tree offsets  forest campaigner jutta kill of european environmental group   clarified the physical reality that  carbon in trees is temporary  trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire  disease  climatic changes  natural decay and timber harvesting  
monocultures and invasive species  in an effort to cut costs  some tree-planting projects introduce fast-growing invasive species that end up damaging native forests and reducing biodiversity  for example  in ecuador  the dutch
has an offset project in the andean
involving 220 square kilometres of
and pine planted  the ngo
criticized the project for destroying a valuable pramo ecosystem by introducing exotic tree species  causing the release of much soil carbon into the atmosphere  and harming local communities who had entered into contracts with the face foundation to plant the trees  however  some certification standards  such as the climate community and biodiversity standard require multiple species plantings 
  a recent study has claimed that plants are a significant source of methane  a potent greenhouse gas  raising the possibility that trees and other terrestrial plants may be significant contributors to global methane levels in the atmosphere  however  this claim has been disputed recently by findings in another study 
  another study suggested that  high latitude forests probably have a net warming effect on the earth s climate   because their absorption of sunlight creates a warming effect that balances out their absorption of carbon dioxide 
necessity  corporate tree-planting is not a new idea  farming operations have been used by companies making
from trees for a long time  if farmed trees are replanted  and the products made from them are placed into
rather than   a very safe  efficient  economical and time-proven method of
of greenhouse carbon is the result of the paper product use cycle  this only holds if the paper in the land fill is not decomposted  in most landfills  this is the case and leads to the fact that more than half of the
emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill
emissions   
indigenous land rights issues  
tree-planting projects can cause conflicts with indigenous people who are displaced or otherwise find their use of forest resources curtailed  for example  a
report documents land disputes and
abuses at   in march 2002  a few days before receiving forest stewardship council certification for a project near mount elgon  the
evicted more than 300 families from the area and destroyed their homes and crops  that the project was taking place in an area of on-going land conflict and alleged human rights abuses did not make it into project report    a 2011 report by
describes a case where over 20,000 farmers in uganda were displaced for a fsc-certified plantation to offset carbon by london-based new forests company
additionality and lack of regulation in the voluntary market  
several certification standards exist  offering variations for measuring emissions baseline  reductions    and other key criteria  however  no single standard governs the industry  and some offset providers have been criticized on the grounds that carbon reduction claims are exaggerated or misleading  problems include 
widespread instances of people and organizations buying worthless credits that do not yield any reductions in carbon emissions 
industrial companies profiting from doing very little  or from gaining carbon credits on the basis of efficiency gains from which they have already benefited substantially 
brokers providing services of questionable or no value 
a shortage of verification  making it difficult for buyers to assess the true value of carbon credits 
perverse incentives  
because offsets provide a revenue stream for the reduction of some types of emissions  they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more  so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline  this is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin  for example  one chinese company generated  500 million in carbon offsets by installing a  5million incinerator to burn the
produced by the manufacture of refrigerants  the huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely for the purpose of increasing production of hfcs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets  not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable  it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse  the practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy  
in
oil companies
40 per cent of the
found  the
plans to build plants to generate electricity from this gas and thus claim 1.5 million offset credits a year  united states company
has also applied for credits in exchange for processing its own waste gas in nigeria  oilwatch org s michael karikpo calls this  outrageous   as flaring is illegal in nigeria  adding that  it s like a criminal demanding money to stop committing crimes  
other negative impacts from offset projects  
although many carbon offset projects tout their environmental co-benefits  some are accused of having negative secondary effects  point carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some
projects as carbon offsets  some countries in the eu are not allowing large projects into the   because of their environmental impacts  even though they have been individually approved by the unfccc and   it is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given the fact that they are a relatively new form of carbon reduction  and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to help solve the issue of greenhouse gas emissions 
offset projects may also have negative social impacts  for example when local residents are evicted to enable a national park to be marketed as a carbon offset
