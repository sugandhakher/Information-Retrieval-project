history  
in 1868 a hydro electric power station was designed and built by
at     it used water from lakes on his estate to power
  the electricity supplied power to lights  heating  produced hot water  ran an elevator as well as labor-saving devices and farm buildings 
in the early 1870s belgian inventor
invented a generator powerful enough to produce power on a commercial scale for industry 
in the autumn of 1882  a central station providing public power was built in   england  it was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company  so the town council decided to use electricity  it used hydroelectric power that was used to street and household lighting  the system was not a commercial success and the town reverted to gas 
in 1882 a public power station  the edison electric light station  was built in london  was a project of
organized by   a
boiler powered a 125-horsepower steam engine that drove a 27-ton generator  this supplied electricity to premises in the area that could be reached through the
of the viaduct without digging up the road  which was the monopoly of the gas companies  the customers included the
and the   another important customer was the telegraph office of the   but this could not be reached though the culverts  johnson arranged for the supply cable to be run overhead  via holborn tavern and  
in september 1882 in new york  the
was established by edison to provide electric lighting in the lower manhattan island area  the station ran until destroyed by fire in 1890  the station used reciprocating
to turn direct-current generators  because of the dc distribution  the service area was small  limited by voltage drop in the feeders  the
eventually resolved in favor of ac distribution and utilization  although some dc systems persisted to the end of the 20th century  dc systems with a service radius of a mile  kilometer  or so were necessarily smaller  less efficient of fuel consumption  and more labor-intensive to operate than much larger central ac generating stations 
ac systems used a wide range of
depending on the type of load  lighting load using higher frequencies  and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies  the economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems  operating at a common frequency  were developed  the same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day  could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve lighting load in the evening  thus improving the system
and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall  many exceptions existed  generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency  and rotating
and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network 
throughout the first few decades of the 20th century central stations became larger  using higher steam pressures to provide greater efficiency  and relying on interconnections of multiple generating stations to improve reliability and cost  high-voltage ac transmission allowed
to be conveniently moved from distant waterfalls to city markets  the advent of the
in central station service  around 1906  allowed great expansion of generating capacity  generators were no longer limited by the power transmission of belts or the relatively slow speed of reciprocating engines  and could grow to enormous sizes  for example 
planned what would have been the largest reciprocating steam engine ever built for a proposed new central station  but scrapped the plans when turbines became available in the necessary size  building power systems out of central stations required combinations of engineering skill and financial acumen in equal measure  pioneers of central station generation include

in uk  and many others 
thermal power stations  
main article 
rotor of a modern steam turbine  used in a power station
in thermal power stations  mechanical power is produced by a
that transforms   often from
of a   into rotational energy  most thermal power stations produce steam  so they are sometimes called steam power stations  not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power  according to the   therefore  there is always heat lost to the environment  if this loss is employed as useful heat  for industrial processes or   the power plant is referred to as a
power plant or chp  combined heat-and-power  plant  in countries where district heating is common  there are dedicated heat plants called   an important class of power stations in the middle east uses by-product heat for the
of water 
the efficiency of a thermal power cycle is limited by the maximum working fluid temperature produced  the efficiency is not directly a function of the fuel used  for the same steam conditions  coal-  nuclear- and gas power plants all have the same theoretical efficiency  overall  if a system is on constantly  base load  it will be more efficient than one that is used intermittently  peak load   steam turbines generally operate at higher efficiency when operated at full capacity 
besides use of reject heat for process or district heating  one way to improve overall efficiency of a power plant is to combine two different thermodynamic cycles in a
plant  most commonly  exhaust gases from a gas turbine are used to generate steam for a boiler and a steam turbine  the combination of a  top  cycle and a  bottom  cycle produces higher overall efficiency than either cycle can attain alone 
classification  
  a large coal-fired generating station in  
 
 
by heat source  
may also use a steam turbine generator or in the case of -fired plants may use a   a coal-fired power station produces heat by burning coal in a steam boiler  the steam drives a
and
that then produces   the waste products of combustion include ash   
and   some of the gases can be removed from the waste stream to reduce pollution 
use a  s heat that is transferred to steam which then operates a steam turbine and generator  about 20 percent of electric generation in the usa is produced by nuclear power plants 
plants use steam extracted from hot underground rocks  these rocks are heated by the decay of radioactive material in the earth s crust 
may be fuelled by     landfill   or other forms of  
in integrated  
is a low-cost  although low-energy-density  fuel 
is occasionally concentrated enough to use for power generation  usually in a steam boiler and turbine 
electric plants use sunlight to boil water and produce steam which turns the generator 
by prime mover  
plants use the dynamic pressure generated by expanding steam to turn the blades of a turbine  almost all large non-hydro plants use this system  about 90 percent of all electric power produced in the world is through use of steam turbines 
plants use the dynamic pressure from flowing gases  air and combustion products  to directly operate the turbine  natural-gas fuelled  and oil fueled  combustion turbine plants can start rapidly and so are used to supply  peak  energy during periods of high demand  though at higher cost than base-loaded plants  these may be comparatively small units  and sometimes completely unmanned  being remotely operated  this type was pioneered by the uk  princetown being the world s first  commissioned in 1959 
plants have both a gas turbine fired by natural gas  and a steam boiler and steam turbine which use the hot exhaust gas from the gas turbine to produce electricity  this greatly increases the overall efficiency of the plant  and many new baseload power plants are combined cycle plants fired by natural gas 
internal combustion
are used to provide power for isolated communities and are frequently used for small cogeneration plants  hospitals  office buildings  industrial plants  and other critical facilities also use them to provide backup power in case of a power outage  these are usually fuelled by diesel oil  heavy oil    and  
 
and internal combustion reciprocating engines are low-cost solutions for using opportunity fuels  such as   digester gas from water treatment plants and waste gas from oil production 
by duty  
power plants that can be dispatched  scheduled  to provide energy to a system include 
run nearly continually to provide that component of system load that doesn t vary during a day or week  baseload plants can be highly optimized for low fuel cost  but may not start or stop quickly during changes in system load  examples of base-load plants would include large modern coal-fired and nuclear generating stations  or hydro plants with a predictable supply of water 
meet the daily peak load  which may only be for one or two hours each day  while their incremental operating cost is always higher than base load plants  they are required to ensure security of the system during load peaks  peaking plants include simple cycle gas turbines and sometimes reciprocating internal combustion engines  which can be started up rapidly when system peaks are predicted  hydroelectric plants may also be designed for peaking use 
can economically follow the variations in the daily and weekly load  at lower cost than peaking plants and with more flexibility than baseload plants 
non-dispatchable plants include such sources as wind and solar energy  while their long-term contribution to system energy supply is predictable  on a short-term  daily or hourly  base their energy must be used as available since generation cannot be deferred  contractual arrangements   take or pay   with independent power producers or system interconnections to other networks may be effectively non-dispatchable 
cooling towers  
main article 
showing evaporating water at  
   natural draft wet
all thermal power plants produce
energy as a byproduct of the useful electrical energy produced  the amount of waste heat energy equals or exceeds the amount of energy converted into useful electricity  gas-fired power plants can achieve as much as 65 percent conversion efficiency  while coal and oil plants achieve around 30 to 49 percent  the waste heat produces a temperature rise in the atmosphere  which is small compared to that produced by
emissions from the same power plant  natural draft wet
at many nuclear power plants and large fossil fuel-fired power plants use large
-like structures  as seen in the image at the right  that release the waste heat to the ambient atmosphere by the
of water 
however  the mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft wet cooling towers in many large thermal power plants  nuclear power plants  fossil-fired power plants       
and
use
to provide air movement upward through downcoming water  and are not hyperboloid chimney-like structures  the induced or forced-draft cooling towers are typically rectangular  box-like structures filled with a material that enhances the mixing of the upflowing air and the downflowing water 
in areas with restricted water use  a dry cooling tower or directly air-cooled radiators may be necessary  since the cost or environmental consequences of obtaining make-up water for evaporative cooling would be prohibitive  these coolers have lower efficiency and higher energy consumption to drive fans  compared to a typical wet  evaporative cooling tower 
once-through cooling systems  
electric companies often prefer to use cooling water from the ocean  a lake  or a river  or a cooling pond  instead of a cooling tower  this single pass or
system can save the cost of a cooling tower and may have lower energy costs for pumping cooling water through the plant s   however  the waste heat can cause
as the water is discharged  power plants using natural bodies of water for cooling are designed with mechanisms such as   to limit intake of organisms into the cooling machinery  these screens are only partially effective and as a result billions of fish and other aquatic organisms are killed by power plants each year  for example  the cooling system at the
in new york kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually 
a further environmental impact is that aquatic organisms which adapt to the warmer discharge water may be injured if the plant shuts down in cold weather 
water consumption by power stations is a developing issue 
in recent years  recycled wastewater  or grey water  has been used in cooling towers  the calpine riverside and the calpine fox power stations in
as well as the calpine mankato power station in
are among these facilities 
power from renewable energy  
power stations can also generate electrical energy from
sources

is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010  representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use 
pumped storage  
main article 
a
is a reversible hydroelectric power plant  they are a net consumer of energy but can be used for storage to smooth peaks and troughs in overall electricity demand  pumped storage plants typically use  spare  electricity during off peak periods to pump freshwater or saltwater from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir  because the pumping takes place  off peak   electricity is typically cheaper than at peak times  this is because power sources such as coal-fired  solar and wind are not switched off and remain in service even when demand is low  during hours of peak demand  when the electricity price is high  the water pumped to the upper reservoir is allowed to flow back to the lower reservoir through a water turbine connected to an electricity generator  unlike coal power stations  which can take more than 12 hours to start up from cold  the hydroelectric plant can be brought into service in a few minutes  ideal to meet a peak load demand  two substantial pumped storage schemes are in south africa 
and another in the drakensberg   
solar

plant by focusing the light to run a heat engine 
a solar photovoltaic power plant converts sunlight into direct current electricity using the  
change the direct current into alternating current for connection to the electrical grid  this type of plant does not use rotating machines for energy conversion 
solar thermal power plants are another type of solar power plant  they use either parabolic troughs or
to direct sunlight onto a pipe containing a heat transfer fluid  such as oil  the heated oil is then used to boil water into steam  which turns a turbine that drives an electrical generator  the central tower type of solar thermal power plant uses hundreds or thousands of mirrors  depending on size  to direct sunlight onto a receiver on top of a tower  again  the heat is used to produce steam to turn turbines that drive electrical generators 
wind  
main article 
wind turbines in  
can be used to generate electricity in areas with strong  steady winds  sometimes   many different designs have been used in the past  but almost all modern turbines being produced today use a three-bladed  upwind design  grid-connected wind turbines now being built are much larger than the units installed during the 1970s  they thus produce power more cheaply and reliably than earlier models  with larger turbines  on the order of one megawatt   the blades move more slowly than older  smaller  units  which makes them less visually distracting and safer for birds 
marine  
main article 
marine energy or marine power  also sometimes referred to as ocean energy or ocean power  refers to the energy carried by       and   the movement of water in the worlds oceans creates a vast store of   or energy in motion  this energy can be harnessed to
electricity to power homes  transport and industries 
the term marine energy encompasses both
 power from surface waves  and
 obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water 
is not a form of marine energy  as wind power is derived from the   even if the

the power generated by a power station is measured in multiples of the   typically
 106 watts  or
 109 watts   power stations vary greatly in capacity depending on the type of power plant and on historical  geographical and economic factors  the following examples offer a sense of the scale 
many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the usa  as of 2011  the
is the second largest onshore wind farm in the world  producing 781.5
of power  followed by the
 735.5 mw   as of july 2013  the
in
is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 630   followed by
in
at 300  
as of 2015  the

solar park in china  rated at 850 megawatts 
solar thermal power stations in the u s  have the following output 
the country s largest solar facility at
has an output of 354 mw
the
planned production is estimated at 485 mw

large coal-fired  nuclear  and hydroelectric power stations can generate hundreds of megawatts to multiple gigawatts  some examples 
the
in the usa has a rated capacity of 802 megawatts 
the coal-fired
in the uk has a rated capacity of 2 gigawatts 
the
hydro-electric plant in egypt has a capacity of 2.1 gigawatts 
the
hydro-electric plant in china has a capacity of 22.5 gigawatts 
gas turbine power plants can generate tens to hundreds of megawatts  some examples 
the
simple-cycle peaking power station in cornwall uk  with a single gas turbine is rated 140 megawatts 
the   a combined-cycle power station in kent  uk with two gas turbines and one steam turbine  is rated 700 megawatts 
the rated capacity of a power station is nearly the maximum electrical power that that power station can produce  some power plants are run at almost exactly their rated capacity all the time  as a non-load-following   except at times of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance 
however  many power plants usually produce much less power than their rated capacity 
in some cases a power plant produces much less power than its rated capacity because it uses an   operators try to pull
from such power plants  because their
is practically zero  but the available power varies widelyin particular  it may be zero during heavy storms at night 
in some cases operators deliberately produce less power for economic reasons  the cost of fuel to run a
may be relatively high  and the cost of fuel to run a
is even higherthey have relatively high marginal costs  operators keep power plants turned off   operational reserve   or running at minimum fuel consumption     spinning reserve   most of the time  operators feed more fuel into load following power plants only when the demand rises above what lower-cost plants  i e   intermittent and base load plants  can produce  and then feed more fuel into peaking power plants only when the demand rises faster than the load following power plants can follow 
operations  
control room of a power plant
the term power station is generally limited to those able to be despatched by a system operator  i e  the system operator can  by one means or another  alter the planned output of the generating facility  
the power station operator has several duties in the electricity-generating facility  operators are responsible for the safety of the work crews that frequently do repairs on the mechanical and electrical equipment  they maintain the equipment with periodic
and log temperatures  pressures and other important information at regular intervals  operators are responsible for starting and stopping the
depending on need  they are able to synchronize and adjust the voltage output of the added generation with the running electrical system  without upsetting the system  they must know the electrical and mechanical systems in order to
solve fix problems in the facility and add to the reliability of the facility  operators must be able to respond to an emergency and know the procedures in place to deal with it
