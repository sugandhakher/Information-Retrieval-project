the annual fuel utilization efficiency  afue  pronounced  a - few  or  a - f - u - e   is a
measure of combustion equipment like     and   the afue differs from the true  thermal efficiency  in that it is not a steady-state  peak measure of conversion efficiency  but instead attempts to represent the actual  season-long  average efficiency of that piece of equipment  including the operating transients  it is a dimensionless ratio of useful energy output to energy input  expressed as a percentage  for example  a 90  afue for a gas furnace means it outputs 90 btus of useful heating for every 100 btus of natural gas input  where the rest may be wasted heat in the exhaust   a higher afue means higher efficiency 
the method for determining the afue for residential furnaces is the subject of
standard 103  a furnace with a thermal efficiency  th  of 78  may yield an afue of only 64  or so  for example  under the standard s test conditions  when estimating annual or seasonal energy used by combustion devices  the afue is the better efficiency measure to use in the calculations  but for an instantaneous fuel consumption rate  the thermal efficiency may be better 
note that the theoretical limit for a conventional furnace s instantaneous efficiency is 100   whereas a heat pump used for building heating may exceed 100   for example  a
of 1.5 is equivalent to 150   heat pumps are readily available for electric and gas sources  so from a theoretical perspective  in some use cases the name  efficiency  may be misleading
