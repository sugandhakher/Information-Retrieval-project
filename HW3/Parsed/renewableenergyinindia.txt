renewable energy in india comes under the purview of the
 mnre   newer renewable electricity sources are targeted to grow massively by 2022  including a more than doubling of india s large wind power capacity and an almost 15 fold increase in solar power from april 2016 levels  such ambitious targets would place india amongst the world leaders in renewable energy use and place india at the centre of its
project promoting the growth and development of solar power internationally to over 120 countries 
india was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of
resources  in early 1980s  as of 30th april 2016 india s cumulative grid interactive or grid tied renewable energy capacity  excluding large hydro  reached about 42.85 gw  surpassing the installed capacity of large scale
for the first time in indian history  63  of the renewable power came from   while
contributed nearly 16   large hydro installed capacity was 42.78 gw as of 30 april 2016 and is administered separately by the ministry of power and not included in mnre targets 
from 2015 onwards the mnre began laying down actionable plans for the renewable energy sector under its ambit to make a quantum jump  building on strong foundations already established in the country 
mnre renewable electrictricity targets have been upscaled to grow from just under 43 gw in april 2016 to 175 gw by the year 2022  including 100 gw from solar power  60 gw from wind power  10 gw from bio power and 5 gw from small hydro power  the ambitious targets would see india quickly becoming one of the leading green energy producers in the world and surpassing numerous developed countries  the government intends to achieve 40  cumulative electric power capacity from non fossil fuel sources by 2030

the figures above refer to newer and fast developing renewable energy sources and are managed by the ministry for new and renewable energy  mnre   in addition as of april 30th 2016 india had 42,783 mw of installed large hydro capacity  which comes under the ambit of ministry of power 
in terms of renewable energy sources under the responsibility of the ministry of new and renewable energy by april 2016  wind power was the leading source of renewable power with 26.9 gw installed capacity  almost two thirds of the total renewable power installed capacity  next came solar power with 6.8 gw installed capacity and biomass power with 4.8 gw accounting for 15.8  and 11.3  of the total renewable power installed capacity  small hydro power accounted for 4.3 gw and waste-to-power accounted for just over 0.1 gw installed capacity  total installed renewable power capacity in this category was just under 43 gw by april 2016 
in terms of meeting its ambitious 2022 targets  as of april 30  2016  wind power was almost half way towards its goal  whilst solar power was below 7  of its highly ambitious target  although expansion is expected to be dramatic in the near future  bio energy was also at just under half way towards its target whilst small hydro

the development of wind power in india began in the 1990s  and has significantly increased in the last few years  although a relative newcomer to the wind industry compared with
or the us  domestic policy support for
has led india to become the country with the fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world 
as of march 31  2016 the installed capacity of wind power in india was 26,769.05   mainly spread across

 746.20 mw  and
 423.40 mw  wind power accounts for 14  of india s total installed power capacity  india has set an ambitious target to generate 60,000 mw of electricity from wind power by 2022

solar power  
main article 
of india
india is densely populated and has high solar   an ideal combination for using
in india  much of the country does not have an   so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping  to begin replacing india s four to five million diesel powered   each consuming about 3.5kilowatts  and off-grid lighting  some large projects have been proposed  and a 35,000km area of the
has been set aside for
projects  sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100 
the indian solar loan programme  supported by the
has won the prestigious
world award for sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems  over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches  particularly in rural areas of south india where the
does not yet extend 
launched in 2003  the indian solar loan programme was a four-year partnership between unep  the unep risoe centre  and two of india s largest banks  the canara bank and syndicate bank 
announced in november 2009  the government of india proposed to launch its
under the national action plan on climate change with plans to generate 1,000mw of power by 2013 and up to 20,000mw grid-based solar power  2,000mw of off-grid solar power and cover 20 million sq metres with collectors by the end of the final phase of the mission in 2020  the mission aims to achieve grid parity  electricity delivered at the same cost and quality as that delivered on the grid  by 2020  achieving this target would establish india as a global leader in solar power generation

waste to energy  
every year  about 55 million tonnes of municipal solid waste  msw  and 38 billion litres of sewage are generated in the urban areas of india  in addition  large quantities of solid and liquid wastes are generated by industries  waste generation in india is expected to increase rapidly in the future  as more people migrate to urban areas and as incomes increase  consumption levels are likely to rise  as are rates of waste generation  it is estimated that the amount of waste generated in india will increase at a per capita rate of approximately 1-1.33  annually  this has significant impacts on the amount of land that is and will be needed for disposal  economic costs of collecting and transporting waste  and the environmental consequences of increased msw generation levels 
india has had a long involvement with
and
technologies  waste water treatment plants in the country have been established which produce renewable energy from sewage gas  however there is significant un-tapped potential  also wastes from the distillery sector are on some sites converted into biogas to run in a
to generate onsite power
