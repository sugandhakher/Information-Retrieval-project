fraunhofer-institut  ime  in
the fraunhofer society    fraunhofer-gesellschaft zur frderung der angewandten forschung e  v   fraunhofer society for the advancement of applied research  pronounced   is a
research organization with 67 institutes spread throughout germany  each focusing on different fields of applied science  as opposed to the   which works primarily on basic science   it employs around 24,000 people  mainly
and   with an annual research budget of about 2.1billion  some basic funding for the fraunhofer society is provided by the state  the german public  through the federal government together with the states or   owns the fraunhofer society   but more than 70  of the funding is earned through contract work  either for government-sponsored projects or from industry 
it is named after
who  as a scientist  an engineer  and an entrepreneur  is said to have superbly exemplified the goals of the society 
the organization has seven centers in the united states  under the name fraunhofer usa  and three in asia  in october 2010  fraunhofer announced that it would open its first research center in south america  fraunhofer uk research ltd was established along with the fraunhofer centre for applied photonics  in glasgow  scotland  in march 2012

the fraunhofer model  
the so-called  fraunhofer model  has been in existence since 1973 and has led to the society s continuing growth  under the model  the fraunhofer society earns about 70  of its income through contracts with industry or specific government projects  the other 30  of the budget is sourced in the proportion 9 1 from federal and state  land  government grants and is used to support preparatory research 
thus the size of the society s budget depends largely on its success in maximizing revenue from commissions  this funding model applies not just to the central society itself but also to the individual institutes  this serves both to drive the realisation of the fraunhofer society s strategic direction of becoming a leader in applied research as well as encouraging a flexible  autonomous and entrepreneurial approach to the society s research priorities

history  
a german stamp  50 years of the fraunhofer society
the fraunhofer society was founded in
on march 26  1949  by representatives of industry and academia  the government of   and the nascent  
in 1952  the federal ministry for economic affairs declared the fraunhofer society to be the third part of the non-university german research landscape  alongside the german research councils  dfg  and the    whether the fraunhofer society should support applied research through its own facilities was  however  the subject of a long-running dispute 
from 1954  the society s first institutes developed  by 1956  it was developing research facilities in cooperation with the ministry of defense  in 1959  the fraunhofer society comprised nine institutes with 135 coworkers and a budget of 3.6million  
in 1965  the fraunhofer society was identified as a sponsor organization for applied research 
in 1968  the fraunhofer society became the target of public criticism for its role in military research 
by 1969  fraunhofer had more than 1,200 employees in 19 institutes  the budget stood at 33 million   at this time  a  commission for the promotion of the development of the fraunhofer society  planned the further development of the fraunhofer society  fhg   the commission developed a financing model that would make the society dependent on its commercial success  this would later come to be known as the  fraunhofer model  
the model was agreed to by the federal cabinet and the bund-lnder-kommission in 1973  in the same year  the executive committee and central administration moved into joint accommodation at leonrodstrae 54 in  
the fraunhofer program for the promotion of the consulting research for
was established  and has gained ever more significance in subsequent years 
in 1977  the political ownership of the society was shared by the ministries of defense and research 
by 1984  the fraunhofer society had 3,500 employees in 33 institutes and a research budget of 360 million  
by 1988  defense research represented only about 10  of the entire expenditure of the fraunhofer society 
by 1989  the fraunhofer society had nearly 6,400 employees in 37 institutes  with a total budget of 700 million  
in 1991  the fraunhofer society faced the challenge of integrating numerous research establishments in former east germany as branch offices of already-existing institutes in the fraunhofer society 
in 1993  the fraunhofer society s total budget exceeded 1billion  
in 1994  the society founded a us-based subsidiary  fraunhofer usa  inc   to extend the outreach of fraunhofer s r d network to american clients 
its mission statement of 2000 committed the fraunhofer society to being a market and customer-oriented  nationally and internationally active sponsor organization for institutes of the applied research 
between 2000 and 2001  the institutes and it research centers of the gmd  gesellschaft fr mathematik und datenverarbeitung  society for mathematics and information technology  were integrated into the fraunhofer society at the initiative of the federal ministry for education and research 
the year 2000 marked a noteworthy success at fraunhofer-institut for integrated circuits  iis     a
audio format which they developed  is the most widely adopted method for compressing and decompressing digital audio 
in 2002  ownership of the heinrich-hertz-institut for communications technology berlin gmbh  hhi   which belonged to the gottfried william leibniz society e  v   gwl   was transferred to the fraunhofer society  with this integration the fraunhofer society budget exceeded 1billion for the first time 
in 2003  the fraunhofer society headquarters moved to its own building in  
the fraunhofer society developed and formulated a firm specific mission statement summarizing fundamental targets and codifying the desired  values and guidelines  of the society s  culture   amongst these  the society committed itself to improving the opportunities for female employees and coworkers to identify themselves with the enterprise and to develop their own creative potential 
in 2004  the former  fraunhofer working group for electronic media technology  at the fraunhofer-institut for integrated circuits  iis  gained the status of an independent institute  it becomes fraunhofer-institut for digital media technology idmt 
new alliances and topic groups helped to strengthen the market operational readiness level of the institutes for fraunhofer in certain jurisdictions 
in 2005  two new institutes  the leipzig fraunhofer-institut for cell therapy and immunology  izi   and the fraunhofer center for nano-electronic technologies cnt in   were founded 
in 2006  the fraunhofer institute for intelligent analysis and information systems  iais  was founded as a merger between the institute for autonomous intelligent systems  ais   and the institute for media communication  imk
