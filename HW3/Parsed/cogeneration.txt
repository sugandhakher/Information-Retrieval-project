cogeneration
cogeneration or combined heat and power  chp  is the use of a
or
to
and
at the same time  trigeneration or combined cooling  heat and power  cchp  refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector 
cogeneration is a
use of   in separate production of electricity  some energy must be discarded as   but in cogeneration some of this
is put to use  all
emit heat during electricity generation  which can be released into the
through     or by other means  in contrast  chp captures some or all of the by-product for   either very close to the plant  orespecially in
and as hot water for
with temperatures ranging from approximately 80 to 130c  this is also called combined heat and power district heating  chpdh   small chp plants are an example of   by-product heat at moderate temperatures  100180c  212356f  can also be used in
for cooling 
the supply of high-temperature heat first drives a
or -powered generator and the resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating as described in cogeneration  at smaller scales  typically below 1 mw  a
or
may be used  trigeneration differs from cogeneration in that the
is used for both heating and cooling  typically in an absorption refrigerator  cchp systems can attain higher overall efficiencies than cogeneration or traditional power plants  in the united states  the application of trigeneration in buildings is called building cooling  heating and power  bchp   heating and cooling output may operate concurrently or alternately depending on need and system construction 
cogeneration was practiced in some of the earliest installations of electrical generation  before central stations distributed power  industries generating their own power used exhaust steam for process heating  large office and apartment buildings  hotels and stores commonly generated their own power and used waste steam for building heat  due to the high cost of early purchased power  these chp operations continued for many years after utility electricity became available

overview  
chp power station in   this station burns straw as fuel  the adjacent greenhouses are heated by
from the plant 
 including those that use
or burn     or    and
in general  do not convert all of their thermal energy into electricity  in most heat engines  slightly more than half is lost as excess
 see 
and    by capturing the excess heat  chp uses heat that would be wasted in a conventional   potentially reaching an
of up to 80   for the best conventional plants  this means that less fuel needs to be consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy 
steam turbines for cogeneration are designed for extraction of steam at lower pressures after it has passed through a number of turbine stages  or they may be designed for final exhaust at back pressure  non-condensing   or both  a typical power generation turbine in a
may have extraction pressures of 160 psig  1.103 mpa  and 60 psig  0.41 mpa   a typical back pressure may be 60 psig  0.41 mpa   in practice these pressures are custom designed for each facility  the extracted or exhaust steam is used for process heating  such as drying paper  evaporation  heat for chemical reactions or distillation  steam at ordinary process heating conditions still has a considerable amount of
that could be used for power generation  so cogeneration has lost opportunity cost  conversely  simply generating steam at process pressure instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has lost opportunity cost   see    the capital and operating cost of high pressure boilers  turbines and generators are substantial  and this equipment is normally operated   which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations 
a cogeneration plant in     the 45mw boiler uses waste wood
as energy source  and provides electricity and heat for 30,000  
some tri-cycle plants have used a
in which several thermodynamic cycles produced electricity  then a heating system was used as a
of the power plant s   for example  the ru-25
in
heated a boiler for a conventional steam powerplant  whose condensate was then used for space heat  a more modern system might use a
powered by   whose exhaust powers a steam plant  whose condensate provides heat  tri-cycle plants can have thermal efficiencies above 80  
the viability of chp  sometimes termed utilisation factor   especially in smaller chp installations  depends on a good baseload of operation  both in terms of an on-site  or near site  electrical demand and heat demand  in practice  an exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists  a chp plant can either meet the need for heat  heat driven operation  or be run as a
with some use of its waste heat  the latter being less advantageous in terms of its utilisation factor and thus its overall efficiency  the viability can be greatly increased where opportunities for
exist  in such cases  the heat from the chp plant is also used as a primary energy source to deliver cooling by means of an  
chp is most efficient when heat can be used on-site or very close to it  overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances  this requires heavily insulated pipes  which are expensive and inefficient  whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire  and over much longer distances for the same energy loss 
a car engine becomes a chp plant in winter when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle  the example illustrates the point that deployment of chp depends on heat uses in the vicinity of the heat engine 
thermally
 teor  plants often produce a substantial amount of excess electricity  after generating electricity  these plants pump leftover steam into heavy oil wells so that the oil will flow more easily  increasing production  teor cogeneration plants in
produce so much electricity that it cannot all be used locally and is transmitted to    
chp is one of the most cost-efficient methods of reducing carbon emissions from heating systems in cold climates
and is recognized to be the most energy efficient method of transforming energy from fossil fuels or biomass into electric power  cogeneration plants are commonly found in
systems of cities  central heating systems from buildings  hospitals  prisons and are commonly used in the industry in thermal production processes for process water  cooling  steam production or
fertilization 
types of plants  
topping cycle plants primarily produce electricity from a steam turbine  the exhausted steam is then condensed and the low temperature heat released from this condensation is utilized for e g 
or  
plants produce high temperature heat for industrial processes  then a waste heat recovery boiler feeds an electrical plant  bottoming cycle plants are only used when the industrial process requires very high temperatures such as furnaces for glass and metal manufacturing  so they are less common 
large cogeneration systems provide heating water and power for an industrial site or an entire town  common chp plant types are 
chp plants using the waste heat in the flue gas of gas turbines  the fuel used is typically  
chp plants use a reciprocating gas engine which is generally more competitive than a gas turbine up to about 5 mw  the gaseous fuel used is normally   these plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site s gas supply  electrical distribution network and heating systems  typical outputs and efficiences see
typical large example see
chp plants use an adapted reciprocating gas engine or   depending upon which biofuel is being used  and are otherwise very similar in design to a gas engine chp plant  the advantage of using a biofuel is one of reduced
consumption and thus reduced carbon emissions  these plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site s electrical distribution and heating systems  another variant is the
chp plant whereby a wood pellet or wood chip biofuel is
in a zero oxygen high temperature environment  the resulting gas is then used to power the gas engine  typical smaller size biogas plant see
power plants adapted for chp
and
have a hot exhaust  very suitable for heating 
chp plants that use the heating system as the
condenser for the steam turbine 
  similar to other steam turbine power plants  can be fitted with extractions in the turbines to bleed partially expanded steam to a heating system  with a heating system temperature of 95c it is possible to extract about 10 mw heat for every mw electricity lost  with a temperature of 130c the gain is slightly smaller  about 7 mw for every mwe lost 
smaller cogeneration units may use a
or   the heat is removed from the exhaust and radiator  the systems are popular in small sizes because small gas and diesel engines are less expensive than small gas- or oil-fired steam-electric plants 
some cogeneration plants are fired by   or industrial and
 see    some chp plants utilize waste gas as the fuel for electricity and heat generation  waste gases can be gas from         and combustible industrial waste gas 
some cogeneration plants combine gas and solar
generation to further improve technical and environmental performance  such hybrid systems can be scaled down to the building level and even individual homes  more recent results show that solar photovoltaic  
  chp hybrid systems are technically viable in the continental u s  to reduce consumer costs  while reducing energy- and electricity-related  
microchp  
or  micro cogeneration  is a so-called
 der   the installation is usually less than 5
in a house or small business  instead of burning fuel to merely heat space or water  some of the energy is converted to electricity in addition to heat  this electricity can be used within the home or business or  if permitted by the grid management  sold back into the electric power grid 
delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64  of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012  20.000 units were sold in
in 2012 overall within the ene farm project  with a
of around 60,000 hours  for pem fuel cell units  which shut down at night  this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years  for a price of  22,600 before installation  for 2013 a state subsidy for 50,000 units is in place 
the development of small-scale chp systems has provided the opportunity for in-house power backup of residential-scale
 pv  arrays  the results of a 2011 study show that a pv chp hybrid system not only has the potential to radically reduce energy waste in the status quo electrical and heating systems  but it also enables the share of solar pv to be expanded by about a factor of five  in some regions  in order to reduce waste from excess heat  an
has been proposed to utilize the chp-produced thermal energy for cooling of pv-chp system 
these   systems have the potential to save even more energy and further reduce emissions compared to conventional sources of power  heating and cooling 
microchp installations use five different technologies   
engines    closed cycle
and   one author indicated in 2008 that microchp based on stirling engines is the most cost effective of the so-called microgeneration technologies in abating carbon emissions  a 2013 uk report from ecuity consulting stated that mchp is the most cost-effective method of utilising gas to generate energy at the domestic level  however  advances in reciprocation engine technology are adding efficiency to chp plant  particularly in the biogas field  as both minichp and chp have been shown to reduce emissions
they could play a large role in the field of co2 reduction from buildings  where more than 14  of emissions can be saved using chp in buildings  the ability to reduce emissions is particularly strong for new communities in emission intensive grids that utilize a combination of chp and photovoltaic systems 
trigeneration  
a plant producing electricity  heat and cold is called a trigeneration or polygeneration plant  cogeneration systems linked to
use waste heat for  
combined heat and power district heating

in the  
distributes 66 billion kilograms of 350f  180c  steam each year through its seven cogeneration plants to 100,000 buildings in the biggest steam district in the united states  the peak delivery is 10 million pounds per hour  or approximately 2.5 gw  
industrial chp  
cogeneration is still common in   refineries and chemical plants  in this  industrial cogeneration chp   the heat is typically recovered at higher temperatures  above 100 deg c  and used for process steam or drying duties  this is more valuable and flexible than low-grade waste heat  but there is a slight loss of power generation  the increased focus on
has made industrial chp more attractive  as it substantially reduces
compared to generating steam or burning fuel on-site and importing electric power from the grid 
utility pressures versus self generating industrial  
industrial cogeneration plants normally operate at much lower boiler pressures than utilities  among the reasons are  1  cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate  because boiler feed water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100  condensing power plants  industries usually have to treat proportionately more boiler make up water  boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized  and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water  2  utilities are typically larger scale power than industry  which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure  3  utilities are less likely to have sharp load swings than industrial operations  which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand 
heat recovery steam generators  
a
 hrsg  is a steam boiler that uses hot exhaust gases from the
or
in a chp plant to heat up water and generate   the steam  in turn  drives a
or is used in industrial processes that require heat 
hrsgs used in the chp industry are distinguished from conventional steam generators by the following main features 
the hrsg is designed based upon the specific features of the gas turbine or reciprocating engine that it will be coupled to 
since the exhaust gas temperature is relatively low  heat transmission is accomplished mainly through  
the exhaust gas velocity is limited by the need to keep head losses down  thus  the transmission coefficient is low  which calls for a large heating surface area 
since the temperature difference between the hot gases and the fluid to be heated  steam or water  is low  and with the heat transmission coefficient being low as well  the evaporator and economizer are designed with plate fin heat exchangers 
comparison with a heat pump  
a
may be compared with a chp unit  in that for a condensing steam plant  as it switches to produce heat  then electrical generation becomes unavailable  just as the power used in a heat pump becomes unavailable    typically for every unit of electrical power lost  then about 6 units of heat are made available at about 90c  thus chp has an effective
compared to a heat pump of 6  it is noteworthy that the unit for the chp is lost at the high voltage network and therefore incurs no losses  whereas the heat pump unit is lost at the low voltage part of the network and incurs on average a 6  loss  because the losses are proportional to the square of the current  during peak periods losses are much higher than this and it is likely that widespread  i e  city-wide application of heat pumps  would cause overloading of the distribution and transmission grids unless they are substantially reinforced 
it is also possible to run a heat driven operation combined with a heat pump  where the excess electricity  as heat demand is the defining factor on utilization  is used to drive a heat pump  as heat demand increases  more electricity is generated to drive the heat pump  with the waste heat also heating the heating fluid 
distributed generation  
trigeneration has its greatest benefits when scaled to fit buildings or complexes of buildings where electricity  heating and cooling are perpetually needed  such installations include but are not limited to  data centers  manufacturing facilities  universities  hospitals  military complexes  and schools  localized trigeneration has addition benefits as described by   redundancy of power in mission critical applications  lower power usage costs and the ability to sell electrical power back to the local utility are a few of the major benefits  even for small buildings such as individual family homes trigeneration systems provide benefits over cogeneration because of increased energy utilization  this increased efficiency can also provide significant reduced   particularly for new communities 
most industrial countries generate the majority of their electrical power needs in large centralized facilities with capacity for large electrical power output  these plants have excellent economies of scale  but usually transmit electricity long distances resulting in sizable losses  negatively affect the environment  large power plants can use cogeneration or trigeneration systems only when sufficient need exists in immediate geographic vicinity for an industrial complex  additional power plant or a city  an example of cogeneration with trigeneration applications in a major city is the

conventional central coal- or nuclear-powered power stations convert only about 33  of their input heat to electricity  the remaining 67  emerges from the turbines as low-grade waste heat with no significant local uses so it is usually rejected to the environment  these low conversion efficiencies strongly suggest that productive uses could be found for this waste heat  and in some countries these plants do collect byproduct heat that can be sold to customers 
but if no practical uses can be found for the waste heat from a central power station  e g   due to distance from potential customers  then moving generation to where the waste heat can find uses may be of great benefit  even though the efficiency of a small distributed electrical generator may be lower than a large central power plant  the use of its waste heat for local heating and cooling can result in an overall use of the primary fuel supply as great as 80   this provides substantial financial and environmental benefits

history  
cogeneration in europe  
a cogeneration thermal power plant in
   
the
has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the   in september 2008 at a hearing of the european parliaments urban lodgment intergroup  energy commissioner andris piebalgs is quoted as saying  security of supply really starts with energy efficiency  energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the european unions cogeneration directive 2004/08 ec  this directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country  the development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances 
the european union generates 11  of its electricity using cogeneration  however  there is large difference between member states with variations of the energy savings between 2  and 60   europe has the three countries with the worlds most intensive cogeneration economies  denmark  the netherlands and finland  of the 28.46 twh of electrical power generated by conventional thermal power plants in finland in 2012  81.80  was cogeneration 
other european countries are also making great efforts to increase efficiency  germany reported that at present  over 50  of the countrys total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration  so far  germany has set the target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5  of the countrys electricity to 25  of the countrys electricity by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly  the uk is also actively supporting combined heat and power  in light of uks goal to achieve a 60  reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050  the government has set the target to source at least 15  of its government electricity use from chp by 2010  other uk measures to encourage chp growth are financial incentives  grant support  a greater regulatory framework  and government leadership and partnership 
according to the iea 2008 modeling of cogeneration expansion for the g8 countries  the expansion of cogeneration in france  germany  italy and the uk alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030  this would increase europes savings from todays 155.69 twh to 465 twh in 2030  it would also result in a 16  to 29  increase in each countrys total cogenerated electricity by 2030 
governments are being assisted in their chp endeavors by organizations like
who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within europes energy policy  cogen is europes umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry 
the european
project ene field deploys in 2017 up 1,000 residential fuel cell combined heat and power    installations in 12 states  per 2012 the first 2 installations have taken place 
cogeneration in the united kingdom  
in the   the combined heat and power quality assurance  chpqa  scheme regulates the combined production of heat and power  chpqa was introduced in 1996  it defines  through calculation of inputs and outputs   good quality chp  in terms of the achievement of primary energy savings against conventional separate generation of heat and electricity  compliance with chpqa is required for cogeneration installations to be eligible for government subsidies and tax incentives 
cogeneration in the united states

perhaps the first modern use of
was done by   his 1882   the worlds first commercial power plant  was a combined heat and power plant  producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings  recycling allowed edisons plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency 
by the early 1900s  regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities  these regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside  but they also discouraged decentralized power generation  such as cogeneration 
by 1978  congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the
 purpa   which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers 
diffusion  
cogeneration plants proliferated  soon producing about 8  of all energy in the united states  however  the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states  resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country   
the
has an aggressive goal of having chp constitute 20  of generation capacity by the year 2030  eight clean energy application centers have been established across the nation whose mission is to develop the required technology application knowledge and educational infrastructure necessary to lead  clean energy   combined heat and power  waste heat recovery and district energy  technologies as viable energy options and reduce any perceived risks associated with their implementation  the focus of the application centers is to provide an outreach and technology deployment program for end users  policy makers  utilities  and industry stakeholders 
high electric rates in new england and the middle atlantic make these areas of the united states the most beneficial for cogeneration 
outside of the united states  energy recycling is more common 
is probably the most active energy recycler  obtaining about 55  of its energy from cogeneration and waste heat recovery    other large countries  including germany  russia  and india  also obtain a much higher share of their energy from decentralized sources
