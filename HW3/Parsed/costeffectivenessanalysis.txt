cost-effectiveness analysis  cea  is a form of
that compares the relative costs and outcomes  effects  of different courses of action  cost-effectiveness analysis is distinct from   which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect  cost-effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services  where it may be inappropriate to
health effect  typically the cea is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure  years of life  premature births averted  sight-years gained  and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain  the most commonly used outcome measure is
 qaly  
is similar to cost-effectiveness analysis  cost-effectiveness analyses are often visualized on a plane consisting of   the cost represented on the xaxis and the effectiveness on the y axis  cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on maximising the average level of an outcome 
extends the core methods of cea to incorporate concerns for the distribution of outcomes as well as their average level and make trade-offs between equity and efficiency  these more sophisticated methods are of particular interest when analysing interventions to tackle

general application  
the concept of cost effectiveness is applied to the planning and management of many types of organized activity  it is widely used in many aspects of life  in the acquisition of military   for example  competing designs are compared not only for purchase price  but also for such factors as their operating   top speed    armor protection  and caliber and armor
of their guns  if a tank s performance in these areas is equal or even slightly inferior to its competitor  but substantially less expensive and easier to produce  military planners may select it as more cost effective than the competitor  conversely  if the difference in price is near zero  but the more costly competitor would convey an enormous battlefield advantage through special ammunition 
and
  enabling it to destroy enemy tanks accurately at extreme ranges  military planners may choose it insteadbased on the same cost effectiveness principle 
cost effectiveness analysis is also applied to many other areas of human activity  including the  
cea in pharmacoeconomics  
in the context of   the cost-effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive intervention is the ratio of the cost of the intervention to a relevant measure of its effect  cost refers to the resource expended for the intervention  usually measured in monetary terms such as
or   the measure of effects depends on the intervention being considered  examples include the number of people cured of a disease  the mm hg reduction in diastolic
and the number of symptom-free days experienced by a patient  the selection of the appropriate effect measure should be based on clinical judgment in the context of the intervention being considered 
a special case of cea is   where the effects are measured in terms of years of full health lived  using a measure such as
or   cost-effectiveness is typically expressed as an
 icer   the ratio of change in costs to the change in effects  a complete compilation of cost-utility analyses in the peer reviewed medical literature is available from the
website 
a 1995 study of the cost-effectiveness of over 500 life-saving medical interventions found that the median cost per intervention was  42,000 per life-year saved  a 2006 systematic review found that industry-funded studies often concluded with cost effective ratios below  20,000 per qaly and low quality studies and those conducted outside the us and eu were less likely to be below this threshold  while the two conclusions of this article may indicate that industry-funded icer measures are lower methodological quality than those published by non-industry sources  there is also a possibility that  due to the nature of retrospective or other non-public work  publication bias may exist rather than methodology biases  there may be incentive for an organization not to develop or publish an analysis that does not demonstrate the value of their product  additionally  peer reviewed journal articles should have a strong and defendable methodology  as that is the expectation of the peer-review process 
cea for energy efficiency investments  
cea has been applied to energy efficiency investments in buildings to calculate the value of energy saved in   kwh  the energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made  such savings are sometimes called   the benefit of the cea approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation  thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments
