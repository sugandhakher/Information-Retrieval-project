contraceptionhow to prevent unwanted pregnancy
birth control methods include    
 iuds     and behavioral methods  they are used before or during sex while
are effective for up to a few days after sex  effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year  and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness  such as  
the most effective methods are those that are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits  surgical sterilization  implantable hormones  and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1   hormonal contraceptive pills  patches or vaginal rings  and the
 lam   if used strictly  can also have first-year  or for lam  first-6-month  failure rates of less than 1   with typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high  at 9   due to incorrect usage  other methods such as condoms  diaphragms  and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage  the
recommends
as first line for young people 
while all methods of birth control have some potential adverse effects  the risk is less than that of   after stopping or removing many methods of birth control  including oral contraceptives  iuds  implants and injections  the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control 
in those with specific health problems  certain forms of birth control may require further investigations  for women who are otherwise healthy  many methods of birth control should not require a including birth control pills  injectable or implantable birth control  and condoms  specifically  a     or blood test before starting birth control pills do not appear to affect outcomes and  therefore  are not required  in 2009  the
 who  published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control 
hormonal  
is available in a number of different forms  including  
under the skin     
and a   they are currently available only for women  although hormonal contraceptives for men have and are being clinically tested  there are two types of oral birth control pills  the
 which contain both estrogen and progesterone  and the
 sometimes called minipills   if either is taken during pregnancy  they do not increase the risk of
nor cause   both types of birth control pills prevent
mainly by inhibiting
and thickening cervical mucous  their effectiveness depends on the user remembering to take the pills  they may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation 
combined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slightly increased risk of
and   venous clots  on average  increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy  due to this risk  they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke  the effect on sexual desire is varied  with increase or decrease in some but with no effect in most  combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of
and
and do not change the risk of   they often reduce menstrual bleeding and   the lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness    and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products 
  injections and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins  in those with a history of arterial blood clots  non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used  progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect   irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods  with some users reporting   the progestins
and
minimize the
side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line  the perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin    is 0.2   the typical use first failure rate is 6

with  
globally  condoms are the most common method of birth control 
are put on a man s erect
and physically block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner  modern condoms are most often made from   but some are made from other materials such as   or lamb s intestine 
are also available  most often made of   latex or polyurethane  male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive  easy to use  and have few adverse effects  making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency  in japan about 80  of couples who are using birth control use condoms  while in germany this number is about 25   and in the united states it is 18  
male condoms and the diaphragm with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18  and 12   respectively  with perfect use condoms are more effective with a 2  first-year failure rate versus a 6  first-year rate with the diaphragm  condoms have the additional benefit of helping to prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted infections such as  
contraceptive sponges combine a barrier with a spermicide  like diaphragms  they are inserted vaginally before intercourse and must be placed over the
to be effective  typical failure rates during the first year depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth  being 24  in those who have and 12  in those who have not  the sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward  allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as

intrauterine devices  
copper t shaped iud with removal strings
the current
 iud  are small devices  often  t -shaped  often containing either copper or levonorgestrel  which are inserted into the uterus  they are one form of
which are the most effective types of reversible birth control  failure rates with the copper iud is about 0.8  while the levonorgestrel iud has a failure rates of 0.2  in the first year of use  among types of birth control  they along with birth control implants result in the greatest satisfaction among users  as of 2007  iuds are the most widely used form of reversible contraception  with more than 180million users worldwide 
evidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents and those who have and have not previously had children  iuds do not affect
and can be inserted immediately after delivery  they may also be used immediately after an   once removed  even after long term use  fertility returns to normal immediately 
while copper iuds may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps hormonal iuds may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether  cramping can be treated with   other potential complications include expulsion  25   and rarely perforation of the uterus  less than 0.7    a previous model of the intrauterine device  the   was associated with an increased risk of   however the risk is not affected with current models in those without
around the time of insertion 
sterilization  
is available in the form of
for women and
for men  there are no significant long-term side effects  and tubal ligation decreases the risk of   short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation  after a vasectomy  there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two  with tubal ligation  complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the   neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections 
this decision may cause regret in some men and women  of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation  about 5  regret their decision  as compared with 20  of women aged under 30  by contrast  less than 5  of men are likely to regret sterilization  men more likely to regret sterilization are younger  have young or no children  or have an unstable marriage  in a survey of biological parents  9  stated they would not have had children if they were able to do it over again 
although sterilization is considered a permanent procedure  it is possible to attempt a
to reconnect the

to reconnect the   in women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse  pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent  with complications including an increased risk of   the number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent  rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent  with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal

behavioral  
behavioral methods involve
or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract  either altogether or when an egg may be present  if used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4   however if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85  
fertility awareness  
a   used for estimating fertility based on days since last menstruation
involve determining the most fertile days of the
and avoiding unprotected intercourse  techniques for determining fertility include monitoring     or the day of the cycle  they have typical first-year failure rates of 24   perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4  to 5   the evidence on which these estimates are based  however  is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early  globally  they are used by about 3.6  of couples  if based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign  the method is referred to as symptothermal  overall first-year failure rates of  2  to 20  have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method 
withdrawal  
the
 also known as coitus interruptus  is the practice of ending intercourse   pulling out   before ejaculation  the main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner  first-year failure rates vary from 4  with perfect usage to 22  with typical usage  it is not considered birth control by some medical professionals 
there is little data regarding the sperm content of   while some tentative research did not find sperm  one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers  the withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3  of couples 
abstinence  
though some groups advocate total   by which they mean the avoidance of all sexual activity  in the context of birth control the term usually means abstinence from vaginal intercourse  abstinence is 100  effective in preventing pregnancy  however  not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity  and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from  
does not reduce   teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education  as compared with comprehensive sex education  some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method s  available  such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills   deliberate
without vaginal sex or deliberate
without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control  while this generally avoids pregnancy  pregnancy can still occur with
and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex  genital rubbing  and the penis exiting from   where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina s lubricating fluids 
lactation  
the
involves the use of a woman s natural
which occurs after delivery and may be extended by   this usually requires the presence of no   exclusively breastfeeding the infant  and a child younger than six months  the
states that if breastfeeding is the infant s only source of nutrition  the failure rate is 2  in the six months following delivery  six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0  and 7.5   failure rates increase to 47  at one year and 13  at two years  feeding formula  pumping instead of nursing  the use of a   and feeding solids all increase its failure rate  in those who are exclusively breastfeeding  about 10  begin having periods before three months and 20  before six months  in those who are not breastfeeding  fertility may return four weeks after delivery 
emergency  
a single-dose emergency contraceptive pill 
methods are medications  sometimes misleadingly referred to as  morning-after pills   or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hope of preventing pregnancy  they work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization  they are unlikely to affect implantation  but this has not been completely exclude  a number of options exist  including      
and iuds 
pills  when used within 3days  decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70   resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2      when used within 5days  decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85   pregnancy rate 1.4   and might be a little more effective than levonorgestrel 
is also more effective than levonorgestrel while copper iuds are the most effective method  iuds can be inserted up to fivedays after intercourse and prevent about 99  of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex  pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2    this makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive  in those who are
or
levonorgestrel is less effective and an iud or ulipristal is recommended 
providing emergency contraceptive pills to women in advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections  condom use  pregnancy rates  or sexual risk-taking behavior  all methods have minimal side effects 
dual protection  
dual protection is the use of methods that prevent both
and pregnancy  this can be with condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of   if pregnancy is a high concern using two methods at the same time is reasonable  and two forms of birth control is recommended in those taking the anti- drug   due to the high risk of
if taken during pregnancy

birth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies  in this population  outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery  delaying another pregnancy after a

globally  as of 2009  approximately 60  of those who are married and able to have children use birth control  how frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries  the most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives  while in africa it is oral contraceptives and in latin america and asia it is sterilization  in the developing world overall  35  of birth control is via female sterilization  30  is via iuds  12  is via oral contraceptives  11  is via condoms  and 4  is via male sterilization 
while less used in the developed countries than the developing world  the number of women using iuds as of 2007 was more than 180million  avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6  of women of childbearing age  with usage as high as 20  in areas of south america  as of 2005  12  of couples are using a male form of birth control  either condoms or a vasectomy  with higher rates in the developed world  usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009  contraceptive use among women in
has risen from about 5  in 1991 to about 30  in 2006 
as of 2012  57  of women of childbearing age want to avoid pregnancy  867 of 1520million   about 222 million women however were not able to access birth control  53million of whom were in sub-saharan africa and 97million of whom were in asia  this results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year  part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons  while another contributor is   due to restrictive

leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm  it is believed that in
was used as birth control which  due to its effectiveness and thus desirability  was harvested into extinction 
in medieval europe  any effort to halt pregnancy was deemed immoral by the   although it is believed that women of the time still used a number of birth control measures  such as
and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina  women in the middle ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy  the oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of
in england  and are dated back to 1640  they were made of animal gut  and were most likely used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the     living in 18th century   described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy  however  condoms only became widely available in the 20th century

in 1916  which was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest  the publicity surrounding the arrest  trial  and appeal sparked birth control activism across the united states 
the first permanent birth-control clinic was established in britain in 1921 by
working with the malthusian league  the clinic  run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors  offered women s birth-control advice and taught them the use of a   her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms  in 1921  sanger founded the american birth control league  which later became the

research directions  
females  
improvements of existing birth control methods are needed  as around half of those who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time  a number of alterations of existing contraceptive methods are being studied  including a better female condom  an improved   a patch containing only progestin  and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone  this vaginal ring appears to be effective for three or four months and is currently available in some areas of the world  for women who rarely have sex  the taking of the hormonal birth control

a number of methods to perform sterilization via the cervix are being studied  one involves putting
in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility  while the procedure is inexpensive and does not require surgical skills  there are concerns regarding long-term side effects  another substance    which functions in the same manner is being looked at  a device called   which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them  was approved in the united states in 2002 
males

methods of male birth control include condoms  vasectomies and withdrawal  between 25 and 75  of males who are sexually active would use hormonal birth control if it was available for them  a number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials  and there is some research looking at the possibility of
