history  
according to the contemporary art historians and curators   the origins of sustainable art can be traced to the
of the late 1960s and early 1970s  with its stress on dematerialisation and questioning of the functioning of the art system  they also connect the rise of the concept of sustainability to the ending of the cold war in 1989 and the emergence of a new awareness of the global character of ecological and social problems  sustainable art adopts  according to these authors  a critical position towards some key practitioners in the
movement of the 1960s  who showed little concern for the environmental consequences of e g  treating the landscape like a giant canvas with a bulldozer for a brush  they have questioned the polemical division between  autonomous  and  instrumental  art originating with modernism  arguing that it is  autonomy that gives art  as well as artists as social actors  the potential to be free and able to offer alternatives to dominant ideological paradigms   since 2005 there is a sustainable arts biennale running at ihlienworth near hamburg  germany  curated by the german conceptional artist and curator samuel j  fleiner  there are a range of interpretations over the relations between art and sustainability  besides the term  sustainable art  promoted by maja and reuben fowkes  other authors prefer the broader notions of  sustainability arts  or  art and sustainability   e g  kagan and kirchberg   still others explicitly rejected the use of the term  sustainable art   referring instead to  artistic work that inspires us to think about sustainability   margot kmann  
professional discussion of the relationship of contemporary art to notions of sustainability blossomed across europe in the early years 2000  with e g  the conference of the german society for political culture  instituts fr kulturpolitik der kulturpolitischen gesellschaft e v    in january 2002 at the art academy of berlin  and the  tutzinger manifest   an international symposium on sustainability and contemporary art took place at   in budapest  hungary  in march 2006  this was the first in a series of international symposia organised by
bringing together contemporary artists  philosophers  environmental sciences and acvitists to explore common ground around issues such as  exit or activism   2008    hard realities and the new materiality   2009  and  art  post-fordism and eco-critique   2010    in marchapril 2007 at the   the arts research network of the european sociological association focused its attention on the recent movements and approaches to  arts and sustainability  at its biennial conference
