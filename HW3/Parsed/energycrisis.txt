an energy crisis is any significant  bottleneck  logistics  or price rise  in the supply of
resources to an   in popular literature  it often refers to one of the energy sources used at a certain time and place  in particular those that supply
or those used as fuel in vehicles 
industrial development and population growth have led to a surge in the global
in recent years  in the 00s  this new demand  together with middle east tension  the falling value of the u s  dollar  dwindling oil reserves  concerns over   and oil price speculation  triggered the   which saw the price of oil reach an all-time high of  147.30 a barrel in 2008

the gasoline shortages of

government actions like tax hikes  nationalisation of energy companies  and regulation of the energy sector  shift supply and demand of energy away from its economic equilibrium 
is possible when
manipulation of markets occurs  a crisis can develop due to industrial actions like
organized
and government embargoes  the cause may be   aging  
disruption or bottlenecks at
and port facilities that restrict fuel supply  an emergency may emerge during very cold winters due to increased consumption of energy 
large fluctuations and manipulations in future
can have a substantial impact on price  large investment banks control 80  of oil derivatives as of may 2012  compared to 30  only a decade ago  this increase contributed to an improvement of global energy output from 117 687 twh in 2000 to 143 851twh in 2008  limitations on free trade for derivatives could reverse this trend of growth in energy production  kuwaiti oil minister hani hussein stated that  under the supply and demand theory  oil prices today are not justified   in an interview with upstream 
pipeline failures and other accidents may cause minor interruptions to energy supplies  a crisis could possibly emerge after infrastructure damage from   attacks by terrorists or
on important infrastructure are a possible problem for energy consumers  with a successful strike on a
facility potentially causing global shortages  political events  for example  when governments change due to regime change  monarchy collapse    and
may disrupt oil and gas production and create shortages  fuel shortage can also be due to the excess and useless use of the fuels 
historical crises  
- caused by the peaking of oil production in major industrial nations        etc   and
from other producers

political riots occurring during the

  caused by abnormally cold temperatures and low water levels in an area dependent on hydroelectric power  at the same time the south african president was appeasing fears of a prolonged electricity crisis in south africa   financial times  retrieved 2008-02-10 
in february 2008 the president of
announced plans to tackle energy shortages that were reaching crisis stage  despite having significant hydrocarbon reserves   in april 2010  the pakistani government announced the   which extended the official weekend and banned neon lights in response to a growing electricity shortage 
  the south african crisis led to large price rises for platinum in february 2008 and reduced gold production 
experienced severe energy shortages towards the end of 2005 and again in early 2008  during the latter crisis they suffered severe damage to power networks along with diesel and coal shortages  supplies of electricity in
province  the manufacturing hub of china  are predicted to fall short by an estimated 10 gw  in 2011 china was forecast to have a second quarter electrical power deficit of 44.85 - 49.85 gw 
predicted that in the years after 2009 the united kingdom will suffer an energy crisis due to its commitments to reduce coal-fired power stations  its politicians  unwillingness to set up new nuclear power stations to replace those that will be de-commissioned  and unreliable sources and sources that are running out of oil and gas  it is therefore predicted that the uk may have regular blackouts like south africa

emerging oil shortage  
main articles 
and
peak oil is the period when the maximum rate of global
is reached  after which the rate of production enters terminal decline  it relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum  this  combined with increasing demand  significantly increases the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products  most significant is the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation   
the us department of energy in the
indicates that the problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary  and past  energy crisis  experience will provide relatively little guidance 
mitigation efforts  
main article 
to avoid the serious
and
implications a global decline in oil production could entail  the 2005 hirsch report emphasized the need to find alternatives  at least ten to twenty years before the peak  and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time  this was similar to
that same year  such
could include energy conservation  fuel substitution  and the use of unconventional oil  because mitigation can reduce the use of traditional petroleum sources  it can also affect the timing of peak oil and the shape of the  
may be reformed leading to greater   for example in
with the

and a peak oil crisis  the imposition of a

to implement a powerdown during a
crisis  while many
and energy policy organisations have advocated reforms to
from the 1970s  some cater to a specific crisis in energy supply including

ecologist
believes that

to avoid a serious energy crisis in coming decades  citizens in the industrial countries should actually be urging their governments to come to international agreement on a persistent  orderly  predictable  and steepening series of oil and natural gas price hikes over the next two decades 

due to a lack of political viability on the issue  government mandated fuel prices hikes are unlikely and the unresolved
of fossil fuel dependence is becoming a   a global
seems improbable  due to the   conclusions that the world is heading towards an unprecedented large and potentially devastating global energy crisis due to a decline in the availability of cheap oil lead to calls for a decreasing dependency on  
other ideas concentrate on design and development of improved  energy-efficient urban infrastructure in developing nations  government funding for alternative energy is more likely to increase during an energy crisis  so too are incentives for   for example  funding for research into
technology increased during the 1970s 
and others have suggested that additional nuclear power plants  particularly
have the
to mitigate
and replace the energy from  
and   the reactors produce electricity and heat so much of the transportation infrastructure should move over to electric vehicles  however  the high process heat of the

from any carbon source

main article 
rather counterintuitively  the world economy has had to deal with the unforeseen consequences of the
also known as   a major energy crisis that took many experts by surprise  this
crisis started with a considerable time-lag  more than six years after the beginning of the    the price of oil  had  stabilized at a relatively high level  around  100 a barrel  unlike all previous recessionary cycles since 1980  start of first persian gulf war   but nothing guarantee d  such price levels in perpetuity  
social and economic effects

and
the
implications of a -induced energy crisis are large  because energy is the resource used to exploit all other resources  when
fail  an energy shortage develops  electricity consumers may experience intentionally engineered
during periods of insufficient supply or unexpected   regardless of the cause 
industrialized nations are dependent on oil  and efforts to restrict the supply of oil would have an adverse effect on the economies of oil producers  for the consumer  the price of  
 petrol  and
for cars and other vehicles rises  an early response from stakeholders is the call for reports  investigations and commissions into the price of fuels  there are also movements towards the development of more
