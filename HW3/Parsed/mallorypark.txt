the circuit  
the circuit has a number of formations  founded on a basic one-mile oval  with the majority of configurations including the northerly extension to the tight  180 shaw s hairpin  at the other end of the circuit lies the long right-hand gerard s bend  gerard s is about a third of a mile long and turns through nearly 200  it was named after local racing hero   who opened the newly reconstructed circuit on 25 april 1956  unusually  there are a number of large lakes occupying approximately half of the circuit infield  despite its short length and shaw s hairpin  the tightest corner of any uk track   other than the hairpin on  s short circuit   mallory is a fast circuit  to reduce speeds for motorcycle racing a pair of chicanes have been introduced  together with a revised exit to gerard s  edwina s was added toward the end of the straight following gerard s  named after former managing director of the circuit edwina overend  and the bus stop chicane on the descent to the sweeping left kink  the devil s elbow  a blind  downhill 
left-hander before the startfinish line on kirkby straight  in 2003 a new complex was added toward the end of gerard s curve  this sequence of bends was designed to reduce speeds on entry to edwina s  and to prevent motorcycles from colliding as they jockey for position into the chicane 
mallory park does not have any true permanent garage facilities  although there are a handful of open garages in the pitlane

motorcycle riders passing through the john cooper esses  taking part in a circuit
the estate at mallory park has many historical connections  the oldest being the unique anglo-saxons defended moat which is now known as   while a roman road passes through the estate  fast forward to the 18th century  when in 1762  sir
became viscount wentworth  the title descended on the distaff side 
married into the wentworth family and it is said on his visits to mallory  he wrote beneath the shade of the lebanon cedar tree which still stands in the grounds of   the last occupant of kirkby hall was
who died in 1941  when it was sold 
during the second world war  the circuit started life royal air force station kirkby mallory  a standby landing ground  slg  during wwii and closed in 1947  the hall was a large house which was demolished in 1952  leaving only the stable block and the coach house which now forms the circuit offices  workshops  hotel  pub and restaurant 
the estate of 300 acres was sold by auction in 1953 and was bought by a mr  moult of derby who planned to have horse racing on the disused pony trotting track  following the war  mallory became a
circuit in the late 1940s  which defined the outline of the oval track still in use today  after the financial collapse of the equestrian club responsible for the circuit  kirkby mallory racing association   the track was hired by various motorcycle clubs for grass track motorcycle and motorcycle sidecar racing  for example  between september 1949 until 1954  the leicester query motorcycle club held grass track races  in 1955  the estate was purchased by clive wormleighton  under whose influence  the present tarmac was constructed at a cost of 60,000 in 1956  upon completion of the building work  a circuit test was held on 26 april  when local grand prix driver
and
respectively conducted a -bristol formula two car and a
motorcycle around the track  gerald managing an 81mph lap 
the very first race was held on 29 april  when the leicester query club organised a motorcycle meeting  a large crowd in excess of 20,000 spectators attended the grand opening event on 13 may 1956  248 riders arrived in leicestershire for this meeting  which saw
set the first lap record at a speed of 84.08mph  riding a

many famous racing stars have raced at mallory over the years  indeed a young
raced against his father    while jack was a successfully grass track racer at mallory  john went on to be only world champion on both two and four wheels 
famous competitors who have raced at mallory  include
who won the first  in 1958  while  the 1960 race  saw
win and set a new lap record of 89mph  both hailwood and surtees  along with jim clark and colin chapman are commemorated with statues at the front gate  around this time  clive wormleighton added the lakes  which were formed by adding the sluice gate across the brook 
1960s  
clive wormleighton continued to run the circuit very successfully until 1962 when ownership passed to the

over the next two years  a considerable amount of money was spent on mallory with the building of new spectator stands and a new commentators press and timekeepers boxes  further developments took place raising the standard of the track  crowd grew and in 1962  over 50,000 people paid to see the post tt international motor cycle meeting  when mike hailwood won  improving the lap record to 91.70mph  this led to it
and sidecar race of the year being sponsored by the daily mail  under the control of grovewood securities  mallory enjoyed its golden days in the 1960s and 1970s with some of the greatest names in motorsport competing there  amongst these  a young austrian who arrived for the whit sunday meeting in 1964  for his first race in england in a new

if he could follow him round to learn the circuit and then proceeded to set fastest time in qualifying  despite being delayed in the race  he finished third behind the reigning world champion 
and his experienced team-mate  
1970s  
throughout the sixties and seventies  the circuit hosted almost every major british car and bike championship  however  on occasions there were european championship events  for example  12 march 1972  saw fia   with dave morgan winning in his reeves racing - bt38  from the future ferrari pairing of

after a little over 20 years the owners of mallory park decided that enough was enough and offered the estate for sale  no doubt the expense of bringing
 which grovewood also owned  up to current grand prix standards had some effort on the decision and the re-opening of   which was only some 20 miles away  may have influenced the decision  whatever the reasons  mallory was once more on the market but  reportedly with a restriction in its future use for motor sport on its future use for motor racing  although planning permission had been obtained for the erection of 30 dwelling on the estate

the history of the 100mph lap at the leicestershire circuit is interesting  the first one was a long time coming  for it was not until 1966 that it finally happened when on 29 may  denny hulme took a
round in 47.6sec at a speed of 102.10mph  two years later 
established the first formula three 100mph lap in a titan  which he took round in 48sec  101.25mph   with coming of the large capacity single-seater like the formula 5000 and formula one cars  the outright record continue to fall until  in 1979

adjacent to the road course is a purpose-built
circuit which played host to the grand prix of great britain in 2008  the event was being organised by off-road promotions company rhl  who originally planned to use the former grand prix circuit at   near swindon  until it became apparent that the infrastructure at the wiltshire venue would not be sufficient for such a high-profile event 
the event was seen as a success by fans  with over 30,000 fans in attendance over the weekend  however  the grand prix only returned once more in 2009 
the circuit has been unused since late 2013 and has fallen into disuse  motocross activities ended due to noise concerns and  in the interests of improving relations with the local community  the new owners of the circuit have no plans to recommence motocross
