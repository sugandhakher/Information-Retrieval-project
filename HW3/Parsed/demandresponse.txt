demand response is a change in the power consumption of an
customer to better match the demand for power with the supply  electric energy can not be easily stored  so utilities have traditionally matched demand and supply by throttling the production rate of their   taking generating units on or off line  or importing power from other utilities  there are limits to what can be achieved on the supply side  because some generating units can take a long time to come up to full power  some units may be very expensive to operate  and demand can at times be greater than the capacity of all the available power plants put together  demand response seeks to adjust the demand for power instead of adjusting the supply 
utilities may signal demand requests to their customers in a variety of ways  including simple off-peak metering  in which power is cheaper at certain times of the day  and   in which explicit requests or changes in price can be communicated to customers 
the customer may adjust power demand by postponing some tasks that require large amounts of electric power  or may decide to pay a higher price for their electricity  some customers may switch part of their consumption to alternate sources  such as on-site diesel generators 
in many respects  demand response can be put simply as a technology-enabled economic rationing system for electric power supply  in demand response  voluntary rationing is accomplished by price incentivesoffering lower net unit pricing in exchange for reduced power consumption in peak periods  the direct implication is that users of electric power capacity not reducing usage  load  during peak periods will pay  surge  unit prices  whether directly  or factored into general rates 
involuntary rationing  if employed  would be accomplished via rolling blackouts during peak load periods  practically speaking  summer heat waves and winter deep freezes might be characterized by planned power outages for consumers and businesses if voluntary rationing via incentives fail to reduce load adequately to match total power supply

background  
according to the   demand response  dr  is defined as  changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time  or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized  dr includes all intentional modifications to consumption patterns of electricity of induce customers that are intended to alter the timing  level of instantaneous demand  or the total electricity consumption  it is expected that demand response programs will be designed to decrease electricity consumption or shift it from on-peak to off-peak periods depending on consumers preferences and lifestyles  demand response can be defined as  a wide range of actions which can be taken at the customer side of the electricity meter in response to particular conditions within the electricity system  such as peak period network congestion or high prices    demand response is a reduction in demand designed to reduce peak demand or avoid system emergencies  hence  demand response can be a more cost-effective alternative than adding generation capabilities to meet the peak and or occasional demand spikes  the underlying objective of dr is to actively engage customers in modifying their consumption in response to pricing signals  the goal is to reflect supply expectations through consumer
or controls and enable dynamic changes in consumption relative to price 
in electricity grids  dr is similar to
mechanisms to manage customer consumption of electricity in response to supply conditions  for example  having electricity customers reduce their consumption at critical times or in response to market prices  the difference is that demand response mechanisms respond to explicit requests to shut off  whereas dynamic demand devices passively shut off when stress in the grid is sensed  demand response can involve actually curtailing power used or by starting on-site generation which may or may not be connected in parallel with the grid  this is a quite different concept from   which means using less power to perform the same tasks  on a continuous basis or whenever that task is performed  at the same time  demand response is a component of smart energy demand  which also includes energy efficiency  home and building energy management    and electric vehicle charging 
current demand response schemes are implemented with large and small commercial as well as residential customers  often through the use of dedicated control systems to shed loads in response to a request by a utility or market price conditions  services  lights  machines  air conditioning  are reduced according to a preplanned load prioritization scheme during the critical time frames  an alternative to load shedding is on-site generation of electricity to supplement the   under conditions of tight electricity supply  demand response can significantly decrease the peak price and  in general  electricity price volatility 
demand response is generally used to refer to mechanisms used to encourage consumers to reduce demand  thereby reducing the
for electricity  since electrical generation and transmission systems are generally sized to correspond to peak demand  plus margin for forecasting error and unforeseen events   lowering peak demand reduces overall plant and
requirements  depending on the configuration of generation capacity  however  demand response may also be used to increase demand  load  at times of high production and low demand  some systems may thereby encourage
to
between periods of low and high demand  or low and high prices  
there are three types of demand response - emergency demand response  economic demand response and ancillary services demand response  emergency demand response is employed to avoid involuntary service interruptions during times of supply scarcity  economic demand response is employed to allow electricity customers to curtail their consumption when the productive or convenience of consuming that electricity is worth less to them than paying for the electricity  ancillary services demand response consists of a number of specialty services that are needed to ensure the secure operation of the transmission grid and which have traditionally been provided by generators 
smart grid application  
applications improve the ability of electricity producers and consumers to communicate with one another and make decisions about how and when to produce and consume electrical power  this emerging technology will allow customers to shift from an event-based demand response where the utility requests the shedding of load  towards a more 24/7-based demand response where the customer sees incentives for controlling load all the time  although this back-and-forth dialogue increases the opportunities for demand response  customers are still largely influenced by economic incentives and are reluctant to relinquish total control of their assets to utility companies 
one advantage of a smart grid application is time-based pricing  customers who traditionally pay a fixed rate for consumed energy    and requested
can set their threshold and adjust their usage to take advantage of fluctuating prices  this may require the use of an energy management system to control appliances and equipment and can involve economies of scale  another advantage  mainly for large customers with generation  is being able to closely monitor  shift  and balance load in a way that allows the customer to save peak load and not only save on kwh and kw month but be able to trade what they have saved in an energy market  again this involves sophisticated energy management systems  incentives  and a viable trading market 
smart grid applications increase the opportunities for demand response by providing
data to producers and consumers  but the economic and environmental incentives remain the driving force behind the practice 
electricity pricing  
explanation of demand response effects on a quantity  q  - price  p  graph  under inelastic demand  d1  extremely high price  p1  may result on a strained  
if demand response measures are employed the demand becomes more elastic  d2   a much lower price will result in the market  p2  
it is estimated that a 5  lowering of demand would result in a 50  price reduction during the peak hours of the
in 2000/2001  the market also becomes more resilient to intentional withdrawal of offers from the supply side 
in most electric power systems  some or all consumers pay a fixed price per unit of electricity independent of the cost of production at the time of consumption  the consumer price may be established by the government or a regulator  and typically represents an average cost per
over a given timeframe  for example  a year   consumption therefore is not sensitive to the cost of production in the short term  e g  on an hourly basis   in economic terms  consumers  usage of electricity is
in short time frames since the consumers do not face the actual price of production  if consumers were to face the short run costs of production they would be more inclined to change their use of electricity in reaction to those price signals  a pure economist might extrapolate the concept to hypothesize that consumers served under these fixed rate tariffs are endowed with theoretical  call options  on electricity  though in reality  like any other business the customer is simply buying what is on offer at the agreed price  a customer in a department store buying a  10 item at 9.00 am might notice 10 sales staff on the floor but only one occupied serving him or her  while at 3.00 pm the customer could buy the same  10 article and notice all 10 sales staff occupied  in a similar manner  the department store cost of sales at 9.00 am might therefore be 5-10 times that of its cost of sales at 3.00 pm  but it would be far-fetched to claim that the customer  by not paying significantly more for the article at 9.00 am than at 3.00 pm  had a  call option  on the  10 article 
in virtually all power systems electricity is produced by generators that are dispatched in merit order  i e   generators with the lowest marginal cost  lowest variable cost of production  are used first  followed by the next cheapest  etc   until the instantaneous electricity demand is satisfied  in most power systems the wholesale price of electricity will be equal to the marginal cost of the highest cost generator that is injecting energy  which will vary with the level of demand  thus the variation in pricing can be significant  for example  in ontario between august and september 2006  wholesale prices  in canadian dollars  paid to producers ranged from a peak of  318 per mwh to a minimum of -  negative   3.10 per mwh  it is not unusual for the price to vary by a factor of two to five due to the daily demand cycle  a negative price indicates that producers were being charged to provide electricity to the grid  and consumers paying real-time pricing may have actually received a rebate for consuming electricity during this period   this generally occurs at night when demand falls to a level where all generators are operating at their minimum output levels and some of them must be shut down  the negative price is the inducement to bring about these shutdowns in a least-cost manner 
two
studies in 2006 looked at the importance of demand response for the electricity industry in general terms and with specific application of real-time pricing for consumers for the
regional transmission authority  the latter study found that even small shifts in peak demand would have a large effect on savings to consumers and avoided costs for additional peak capacity  a 1  shift in peak demand would result in savings of 3.9   billions of dollars at the system level  an approximately 10  reduction in peak demand  achievable depending on the   would result in systems savings of between  8 to  28 billion 
in a discussion paper  ahmad faruqui  a principal with the brattle group  estimates that a 5 percent reduction in us peak electricity demand could produce approximately  35 billion in cost savings over a 20-year period  exclusive of the cost of the metering and communications needed to implement the dynamic pricing needed to achieve these reductions  while the net benefits would be significantly less than the claimed  35 billion  they would still be quite substantial  in ontario  canada  the independent electricity system operator has noted that in 2006  peak demand exceeded 25,000 megawatts during only 32 system hours  less than 0.4  of the time   while maximum demand during the year was just over 27,000 megawatts  the ability to  shave  peak demand based on reliable commitments would therefore allow the province to reduce built capacity by approximately 2,000 megawatts 
electricity grids and peak demand response  
the upper reservoir  llyn stwlan  and dam of the
in north wales
in an electricity grid  electricity consumption and production must balance at all times  any significant imbalance could cause grid instability or severe voltage fluctuations  and cause failures within the grid  total generation capacity is therefore sized to correspond to total peak demand with some margin of error and allowance for contingencies  such as plants being off-line during peak demand periods   operators will generally plan to use the least expensive generating capacity  in terms of   at any given period  and use additional capacity from more expensive plants as demand increases  demand response in most cases is targeted at reducing peak demand to reduce the risk of potential disturbances  avoid additional capital cost requirements for additional plants  and avoid use of more expensive and or less efficient operating plants  consumers of electricity will also pay higher prices if generation capacity is used from a higher-cost source of power generation 
demand response may also be used to increase demand during periods of high supply and or low demand  some types of generating plant must be run at close to full capacity  such as nuclear   while other types may produce at negligible marginal cost  such as wind and solar   since there is usually limited capacity to store energy  demand response may attempt to increase load during these periods to maintain grid stability  for example  in the province of ontario in september 2006  there was a short period of time when electricity prices were negative for certain users 
such as
is a way to increase load during periods of low demand for use during later periods  use of demand response to increase load is less common  but may be necessary or efficient in systems where there are large amounts of generating capacity that cannot be easily cycled down 
some grids may use pricing mechanisms that are not real-time  but easier to implement  users pay higher prices during the day and lower prices at night  for example  to provide some of the benefits of the demand response mechanism with less demanding technological requirements  for example  in 2006 ontario began implementing a  smart meter  program that implements  time-of-use   tou  pricing  which tiers pricing according to on-peak  mid-peak and off-peak schedules  during the winter  on-peak is defined as morning and early evening  mid-peak as mid-day to late afternoon  and off-peak as night-time  during the summer  the on-peak and mid-peak periods are reversed  reflecting air conditioning as the driver of summer demand  as of may 1  2015  most ontario electrical utilities have completed converting all customers to  smart meter  time-of-use billing with on-peak rates about 200  and mid-peak rates about 150  of the off-peak rate per kwh 
load shedding  
and transmission systems may not always meet peak demand requirements the greatest amount of
required by all utility customers within a given region  in these situations  overall demand must be lowered  either by turning off service to some devices or cutting back the supply voltage     in order to prevent uncontrolled service disruptions such as
 widespread blackouts  or equipment damage  utilities may impose load shedding on service areas via
or by agreements with specific high-use industrial consumers to turn off equipment at times of system-wide peak demand 
incentives to shed loads  
energy consumers need some incentive to respond to such a request from a
 see list of providers below   demand response incentives can be formal or informal  for example  the utility might create a tariff-based incentive by passing along short-term increases in the price of electricity  or they might impose mandatory cutbacks during a heat wave for selected high-volume users  who are compensated for their participation  other users may receive a rebate or other incentive based on firm commitments to reduce power during periods of high demand  almost never referred to as  
commercial and industrial power users might impose load shedding on themselves  without a request from the utility  some businesses generate their own power and wish to stay within their energy production capacity to avoid buying power from the grid  some utilities have commercial tariff structures that set a customer s power costs for the month based on the customer s moment of highest use  or peak demand  this encourages users to flatten their demand for energy  known as   which sometimes requires cutting back services temporarily 
has been implemented in some jurisdictions to provide real-time pricing for all types of users  as opposed to fixed-rate pricing throughout the demand period  in this application  users have a direct incentive to reduce their use at high-demand  high-price periods  many users may not be able to effectively reduce their demand at various times  or the peak prices may be lower than the level required to induce a change in demand during short time periods  users have low   or
is low   automated control systems exist  which  although effective  may be too expensive to be feasible for some applications 
technologies for demand reduction  
further information 
technologies are available  and more are under development  to automate the process of demand response  such technologies detect the need for   communicate the demand to participating users  automate load shedding  and verify compliance with demand-response programs 
and
are two major federal initiatives in the united states to develop these technologies  universities and private industry are also doing research and development in this arena  scalable and comprehensive software solutions for dr enable business and industry growth 
some utilities are considering and testing automated systems connected to industrial  commercial and residential users that can reduce consumption at times of peak demand  essentially delaying draw marginally  although the amount of demand delayed may be small  the implications for the grid  including financial  may be substantial  since system stability planning often involves building capacity for extreme peak demand events  plus a margin of safety in reserve  such events may only occur a few times per year 
the process may involve turning down or off certain appliances or sinks  and  when demand is unexpectedly low  potentially increasing usage   for example  heating may be turned down or
or
may be turned up  turning up to a higher temperature uses less electricity   delaying slightly the draw until a peak in usage has passed  in the city of toronto  certain residential users can participate in a program  peaksaver ac  whereby the system operator can automatically control hot water heaters or air conditioning during peak demand  the grid benefits by delaying peak demand  allowing peaking plants time to cycle up or avoiding peak events   and the participant benefits by delaying consumption until after peak demand periods  when pricing should be lower  although this is an experimental program  at scale these solutions have the potential to reduce peak demand considerably  the success of such programs depends on the development of appropriate technology  a suitable pricing system for electricity  and the cost of the underlying technology  bonneville power experimented with direct-control technologies in washington and oregon residences  and found that the avoided transmission investment would justify the cost of the technology 
other methods to implementing demand response approach the issue of subtly reducing duty cycles rather than implementing
setbacks  these can be implemented using customized building automation systems programming  or through swarm-logic methods coordinating multiple loads in a facility  e g  regen energy s envirogrid controllers  
it was recently announced that electric refrigerators will be sold in the uk sensing
which will delay or advance the cooling cycle based on monitoring grid frequency 
industrial customers  
industrial customers are also providing demand response  compared with commercial and residential loads  industrial loads have the following advantages  the magnitude of power consumption by an industrial manufacturing plant and the change in power it can provide are generally very large  besides  the industrial plants usually already have the infrastructures for control  communication and market participation  which enables the provision of demand response  moreover  some industrial plants such as the aluminum smelter are able to offer fast and accurate adjustments in their power consumption  for example  alcoa s warrick operation is participating in miso as a qualified demand response resource  and the trimet aluminium uses its smelter as a short-term mega-battery 
short-term inconvenience for long-term benefits  
shedding loads during peak demand is important because it reduces the need for new power plants  to respond to high peak demand  utilities build very capital-intensive power plants and lines  peak demand happens just a few times a year  so those assets run at a mere fraction of their capacity  electric users pay for this idle capacity through the prices they pay for electricity  according to the demand response smart grid coalition  10 20  of electricity costs in the united states are due to peak demand during only 100 hours of the year  dr is a way for utilities to reduce the need for large capital expenditures  and thus keep rates lower overall  however  there is an economic limit to such reductions because consumers lose the productive or convenience value of the electricity not consumed  thus  it is misleading to only look at the cost savings that demand response can produce without also considering what the consumer gives up in the process 
importance for the operation of electricity markets  
it is estimated that a 5  lowering of demand would have resulted in a 50  price reduction during the peak hours of the
in 20002001  with consumers facing peak pricing and reducing their demand  the market should become more resilient to intentional withdrawal of offers from the supply side 
residential and commercial electricity use often vary drastically during the day  and demand response attempts to reduce the variability based on pricing signals  there are three underlying tenets to these programs 
unused electrical production facilities represent a less efficient use of capital  little revenue is earned when not operating  
electric systems and grids typically scale total potential production to meet projected peak demand  with sufficient spare capacity to deal with unanticipated events  
by  smoothing  demand to reduce peaks  less investment in operational reserve will be required  and existing facilities will operate more frequently 
in addition  significant peaks may only occur rarely  such as two or three times per year  requiring significant capital investments to meet infrequent events 
us energy policy act regarding demand response  
the
has mandated the
to submit to the
 a report that identifies and quantifies the national benefits of demand response and makes a recommendation on achieving specific levels of such benefits by january 1  2007   such a report was published in february 2006 
the report estimates that in 2004 potential demand response capability equaled about 20,500 megawatts     3  of total u s  peak demand  while actual delivered peak demand reduction was about 9,000 mw  1.3  of peak   leaving ample margin for improvement  it is further estimated that load management capability has fallen by 32  since 1996  factors affecting this trend include fewer utilities offering load management services  declining enrollment in existing programs  the changing role and responsibility of utilities  and changing supply demand balance 
to encourage the use and implementation of demand response in the united states  the
 ferc  issued order no  745 in march 2011  which requires a certain level of compensation for providers of economic demand response that participate in wholesale power markets  the order is highly controversial and has been opposed by a number of energy economists  including professor
at  s   professor hogan asserts that the order overcompensates providers of demand response  thereby encouraging the curtailment of electricity whose economic value exceeds the cost of producing it  professor hogan further asserts that order no  745 is anticompetitive and amounts to an application of regulatory authority to enforce a buyers cartel  several affected parties  including the state of california  have filed suit in federal court challenging the legality of order 745  a debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in  
on may 23  2014  the
vacated order 745 in its entirety  on may 4  2015  the
agreed to review the dc circuit s ruling  addressing two questions 
whether the federal energy regulatory commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the federal power act  16 u  s  c  791a et seq   to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates 
whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the federal energy regulatory commission is arbitrary and capricious 
on january 25  2016  the united states supreme court in a 6-2 decision in
concluded that the federal energy regulatory commission acted within its authority to ensure  just and reasonable  rates in the wholesale energy market 
demand reduction and the use of diesel generators in the uk national grid  
as of december 2009 uk national grid had 2369mw contracted to provide demand response  known as   the demand side provides 839mw  35   from 89 sites  of this 839mw approximately 750mw is back-up generation with the remaining being load reduction  a paper based on extensive half-hourly demand profiles and observed electricity demand shifting for different commercial and industrial buildings in the uk shows that only a small minority engaged in load shifting and demand turn-down  while the majority of demand response is provided by stand-by generators
