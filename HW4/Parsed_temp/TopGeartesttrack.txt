the top gear test track is used by the bbc automotive television programme top gear  it is located at dunsfold aerodrome in surrey  united kingdom  the track was designed by lotus cars as a testing facility for the colin chapman-run company  with many of its formula one cars tested there  it is used to test both cars and drivers seen on the programme  mainly in power laps and star in a reasonably priced car 
for the 23rd series of top gear the track was expanded with a rallycross section for the new  star in a rallycross car  segment

layout edit 
the track is on a former royal canadian air force airbase constructed during the second world war and later used by british aerospace as a manufacturing and test facility  the track s main route  marked by painted lines and simple structures such as stacks of tyres  was designed by test drivers from lotus  1  2  the layout of the track is designed to put the car through various conditions  ranging from provoking understeer to testing brake balance and tyres  the track is approximately 1.75 miles  2.82km  long  it is considered to be an equaliser for cars since  according to richard hammond  both 060 miles per hour  096.6km h  times and top speed are totally meaningless  1  the track also incorporates a drag strip  although this is not used for timed segments  it does feature in some challenges and other features on the show 
the course starts on the perimeter road outside the top gear studio  the first bend is a fast right-left kink named  crooner curves    willson bend  is the first proper turn on the track and the first corner usually seen when the stig is lapping a car  3   chicago   a long right-hand around a tyre wall onto the main runway  was designed by lotus as a steady state corner  designed to highlight understeer or oversteer of the chassis  next is  hammerhead   a left-then-right corner  which again highlights understeer and oversteer  the track comes to a right-hand curve  then the course turns right through the flat-out section called the  follow through   after the left hand  bentley bend  named after the person who first  discovered  jeremy clarkson and former top gear presenter  jon bentley  but commonly referred to simply as  the tyres   the course comes to  bacharach bend   which  after the first series  has been referred to as the  penultimate corner  or the  second-to-last corner  and is often regarded as one of the most challenging on the course  the final turn before the finish line is  gambon  in honour of sir michael gambon  who completed the turn on two wheels in episode 8 of series 1  prior to this  the corner was known as  carpenters corner   4 
usage edit 
the track is used routinely for the star in a reasonably-priced car and power laps segments on top gear  it also serves myriad roles in other portions of the programme  especially in testing cars and in challenges  when testing cars  they are often driven around the airfield by the presenters  afterwards  they are taken around the test track by the stig to set a lap time  occasionally  drag races and speed tests are held on the runway 
cars acquired during challenges must often post lap times  driven by either one of the presenters or the stig  around the track against either a target time or a time set by the stig in another vehicle  during many challenges  the track is used in more unorthodox fashions  for instance  serving as a makeshift motorway lane during a challenge testing tailgating prowess with vans 
power laps edit 
top gear test track
power laps is a segment of the programme in which the stig completes a lap around the track in a reviewed car to compare its performance to previous contenders 
to be eligible to appear on the power lap times board  a vehicle must be a road-legal production car and must have sufficient ride height to clear a standard speed bump  referred to by the presenters as a sleeping policeman   5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  although occasionally vehicles that cannot appear on the list are still timed  whenever a non-qualifying vehicle is raced  the time is compared to the official power laps but then removed from the board  for example - the ferrari fxx owned by michael schumacher  1 10.7  was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres 
all laps are timed with the car s manufacturer-provided adjustable settings configured for maximum performance  all adjustable suspensions are set at their most efficient  all gear shift maps are at their most aggressive  and driving aids such as traction control are deactivated  lap times do not offer complete comparisons between the cars  mainly because wet or otherwise poor weather conditions  see time deductions below  can negatively affect lap times

due to the size of the list  only the top 20 are shown  see list of top gear test track power lap times for the full list 
the second most powerful production car ever featured on top gear  the 1001 ps  987bhp  736kw  bugatti veyron  was taken around the track by the stig in series 12  episode 4  after 3 years of waiting  however  it disappointed the team by only managing fifth place on the power board  currently 16th   an unexpectedly low position ultimately attributed to the car s kerb weight of 1,888kg  4,162lb   more than any of the four faster cars  15  in series 15 episode 5 however  the stig took the 1,200 ps super sport version around the track in 1 16.8  thus setting a new lap record 
for the 1 17.6 lap  the koenigsegg ccx  written as  koeniggggsenisseggsegnignigsegigisegccx2 with the top gear wing  on a much-longer magnetic strip  because none of the presenters were able to spell koenigsegg  was fitted with an optional rear spoiler to provide downforce after the stig spun the unmodified version off the track  the stig allegedly recommended this modification  correctly predicting that the car would then be the fastest ever round the track  16  although koenigsegg stated that the improvement was due to other adjustments  17 
lap times of non-qualifying vehicles edit 
a  non-qualifying  vehicle is one that does not meet the presenters  requirements to remain on the board  that is  one that is not a  road car   which according to top gear means being  available to buy  fully road-legal  lights  indicators  registration  profile tyres  etc    and street-worthy  i e  able to negotiate a speed bump   5

1 22.6  westfield xtr2 6 
the caparo  radical  and westfield are road-legal in the uk but are unable to clear a speed bump  according to caparo  the car driven by top gear was a prototype that didn t feature the adjustable ride height found on the production model  because the stig set his time in the non-adjustable prototype and the production version has not been driven around the track  the caparo s time remains ineligible for the power lap board 
non-top gear laps edit 
occasionally attempts at the power lap record are made without the support of the bbc  the following laps of dunsfold were recorded  filmed and promoted independently of the top gear television programme

ultima claim that their motive for running a non-televised lap was that they felt that the gtr was being specifically ignored by the producers of top gear  27  why dunlop  injection chose to run a lap of the dunsfold circuit is not stated  although it is noticeable that the slower  official  caterham run was limited by cold tyres 
celebrity laps edit 
star in a reasonably priced car  series 1-22  edit 
star in a reasonably priced car was a recurring segment on top gear  during most programmes  a celebrity  usually  but not exclusively of british fame  is interviewed by jeremy clarkson  discussion is normally amusing  and focuses on car-related matters  such as the celebrity s car history  then clarkson and the studio audience watch the guest s fastest lap on the top gear test track  after which clarkson puts the celebrity s time on the time board 
suzuki liana  20022005  edit 
top gear s suzuki liana
for the first seven series the car driven for lap times was a suzuki liana  when first introduced  the car was worth 9995  28  the car used is stock except for a roll cage and racing seats added as safety measures  each guest practises with the stig before making several attempts to complete the test track in the fastest time  the guest does not learn their time until the interview  practice laps  crashes and the drivers  facial expressions are also shown during the segment 
the two slowest laps on the liana celebrity list are held by terry wogan and richard whiteley  both of whom were beaten by billy baxter  a bosnian war veteran who is completely blind  he guided the liana through the track under direction from clarkson in the passenger seat in a time of 2 minutes 2 seconds  which was 1.4 seconds quicker than terry wogan  and 4 seconds faster than richard whiteley 
the fastest non-professional driver was ellen macarthur  unlike most contenders she made no comments to the camera during her lap  she completed the lap in 1 minute 46.7 seconds  beating jimmy carr by 0.2 seconds  the current fastest professional driver in the liana is daniel ricciardo with 1 42.2 
the liana endured considerable abuse from the stars while undertaking their laps  in one incident  actor michael gambon clipped the final corner  taking the car onto two wheels  it was done in such a spectacular fashion that the corner was named  gambon corner   when lionel richie drove the liana  one of the front wheels fell off  invoking clarkson to coin the term  pulling a lionel   trevor eve also lost a wheel  the former british transport minister stephen ladyman added further injury to the liana by denting the boot when he lost control during practice and slid backwards into a tyre wall  david soul destroyed the gearbox of two lianas during his time on the show due to his rough driving style  patrick kielty broke the liana s front suspension during series 4 when he drove on the grass  christopher eccleston was the only celebrity to use a liana with an automatic transmission  because a hesitant eccleston admitted he was  only qualified to drive an automatic   to accommodate his needs  top gear succeeded in borrowing an automatic liana  of which only 40 existed in the uk  as a reference to his role in doctor who  the automatic liana was shown materialising onto the racing track  with a tardis materialisation sound effect played over it 
the liana has also been modified on several occasions  david soul s liana featured a red police light and a white stripe in reference to his starsky and hutch role  johnny vegas was provided with l-plates as he had not passed his driving test at the time  when justin hawkins came on the show  the liana he drove had flame decals pasted on it  actor sanjeev bhaskar had an ornate tissue box placed in the back  an homage to indian drivers 
in its service  the liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit  went through 400 tyres  its brakes were changed 100 times  and it required six new clutches  two new hubs  driveshafts  wishbones  struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror  29 
in july 2005  formula one driver damon hill appeared on the show for the first time as the star  this was kept a surprise to the audience and the viewing public  and when nigel mansell came on the show  it was covered up in magazines and on the internet by saying that the star in a reasonably priced car would be alan titchmarsh  since mansell s appearance the liana has remained in use as a vehicle reserved for formula 1 drivers 
for some of the laps more than one person has been present in the car  this was the case for clarkson s run when he had both hammond and jason dawe in the car  trinny and susannah were both in the car for each other s runs  denise van outen was in the car when johnny vaughan did his lap  van outen never did a lap driving the car  clarkson was also present as a navigator for billy baxter s laps

chevrolet lacetti  20062009  edit 
starting with the eighth series the liana was replaced by a chevrolet lacetti and a new blank scoreboard  the format was changed so that each star would have five practice laps  and then a final timed lap  with no allowance being given for mishaps 
as a starter for the new car and format  an open day was held for any celebrity who wanted to take part  seven stars recorded times that day  james hewitt  who jeremy and richard referred to as the  well spoken man  after failing to recognise him   comedians alan davies and jimmy carr  rock stars rick wakeman and justin hawkins  footballer les ferdinand  and actor trevor eve who topped the time at 1 minute 47.0 seconds  jimmy carr  who held second place in the liana behind ellen macarthur  spun off while doing his timed lap and got the second to one slowest time ever around the track at 2 minutes  8.91 seconds 
on 28 january 2007  jamie oliver posted a time of 1 47.70 in melted snow and standing water  given the rivalry oliver felt towards fellow celebrity chef  and then-lapboard leader  gordon ramsay  oliver asked that the 4-second allowance normally granted for wet laps be used to put him at the top of the leaderboard  just for a day  
actress billie piper posted a time of 1 48.3 but was deemed by the stig to have failed to complete a lap properly  as she failed to negotiate some corners  the stig suggested a three-second time penalty  but after clarkson consulted the audience  it was decided to let the time stand  which her doctor who co-star  david tennant  tried to overturn on 23 december 2007 show  at the end of the following series  clarkson remarked that if tennant had worn a see through top  like piper for her interview   he  would have been faster than simon cowell  
in the 11 november 2007 episode  simon cowell retook his status as the holder of the fastest lap with a time of 1 45.90  according to clarkson  the cameramen said they had never seen such consistency in the practice laps  32  however  cowell was knocked off the top spot in series 11 by jay kay  who now holds the fastest time in the lacetti  although clarkson selected the fastest of jay kay s times rather than the last run  which was slower than cowell s time  seemingly due to a dislike of cowell  he claimed earlier in the episode that cowell had been at the top of the leaderboard for too long   had this not happened  cowell would have been knocked off the top by grand designs host kevin mccloud 
clarkson has referred to the part of the board with times of 1 51 and over as the  thespian zone  due to the propensity for classically trained actors to post slow times 
series 11 featured a slight change to the format  with two  stars  per episode instead of the previous one  although there had been a couple of editions in previous series  with more than one guest   each of the pair are professionally associated with their fellow guest  usually both either act in or present the same tv show  unlike previous episodes where two stars have appeared  the stars drove individual laps without the other present in the car 
on 28 march 2010  richard hammond attended the demolition of the two 550ft chimneys at lafarge cement s northfleet works  33  on the first episode of series 15  it was shown that the lacetti was partially crushed by placing it in the path of one of the falling chimneys

f1 drivers edit 
all formula one drivers are put into their own list with regard to lap times because of their exceptional skill level  when the liana was pulled out from retirement to allow jenson button to make a time  clarkson noted that the liana would be pulled out for use by formula 1 drivers in the future 
the original  black  stig and the first  white  stig have done laps around the track in the suzuki liana  both had their times removed from the leaderboard upon their departure 
the first stig was perry mccarthy  who once test drove for the williams f1 team  and drove for the ill-fated andrea moda formula one team  36  the second stig was ben collins  in the first episode of series 13 the stig was  revealed  to be michael schumacher  although this was a joke in the vein of the rest of his appearance on the show 
on 6 july 2011  sebastian vettel managed to top the board with a time of 1 44.0  vettel s lap was the first time someone taking a  formula one drivers  line through the first corner was able to top the stig s time  as rubens barrichello took the tighter line  clarkson also mentioned on this episode that the current stig has yet to do a lap of the track in the liana  therefore there is currently no time on the board for the stig 
on 17 february 2013  lewis hamilton returned to do a dry lap and lowered the f1 drivers record by 1.1s to 1 42.9  this was in the wake of his move to mercedes amg for the 2013 season 
on 8 february 2015  daniel ricciardo topped the board with a lap time of 1 42.2  ricciardo took the tighter line through the first corner  claiming that it covered less distance

  a b  series 1 episode 3   top gear  series 1  episode 3  3 november 2002  bbc two  jeremy clarkson   we said you could only take a car on that track if it s road legal

  a b  series 5 episode 1   top gear  series 5  episode 8  19 december 2004  bbc two  jeremy clarkson   the thing is though  this is only for cars with ashtrays and noses that you can get over the    uh  speed bumps  it s only for road cars  
   series 5 episode 9   top gear  series 5  episode 9  26 december 2004  bbc two  jeremy clarkson   you can use it on the road because    the test that we have for our power board   cause only road cars can go on this  is whether they can get over a speed bump  
  a b  series 6 episode 1   top gear  series 6  episode 6  3 july 2005  bbc two  jeremy clarkson   you can t buy this car so it has no place on our board   james may   but he s right though  those are the rules

   series 10 episode 9   top gear  series 10  episode 9  9 december 2007  bbc two  jeremy clarkson   now because this has a hydraulic lifting nose  which we can see here  it is able to get over speed bumps and that means it is a road car and that means it can go on our board

   series 16 episode 3   top gear  series 16  episode 3  6 february 2011  bbc two  jeremy clarkson   not the volvo obviously because this board is for production cars only
