the green paradox  identified by german economist hans-werner sinn  is the observation that an environmental policy that becomes greener with the passage of time acts like an announced expropriation for the owners of fossil fuel resources  inducing them to accelerate resource extraction and hence to accelerate global warming

main line of reasoning edit 
the green paradoxs line of reasoning starts by recognizing a fundamental  unavoidable fact  every carbon atom in the gas  coal or oil extracted from the ground to be used as fuel ends up in the atmosphere  in particular if high efficiency combustion processes ensure that no part of it ends up as soot  about a quarter of the emitted carbon will stay in the atmosphere practically forever  contributing to the greenhouse effect that causes global warming  1  2  3 
apart from afforestation  only two things can mitigate the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere  either less carbon is extracted from the ground  or it is injected back underground after harvesting its energy 
environmental policy efforts  however  in particular european ones  go in neither of these two directions  aiming instead at the promotion of alternative  co2-free energy sources and a more efficient use of energy  in other words  they only address the demand side of the carbon market  neglecting the supply side  despite considerable investment  the efforts to curtail demand have not entirely had the effect hoped for 
the reason behind this  according to sinn  is that green policies  by heralding a gradual tightening of policy over the coming decades  exert a stronger downward pressure on future prices than on current ones  decreasing thus the rate of capital appreciation of the fossil fuel deposits  the owners of these resources regard this development with concern and react by increasing extraction volumes  converting the proceeds into investments in the capital markets  which offer higher yields  that is the green paradox  environmental policy slated to become greener over time acts as an announced expropriation that provokes owners to react by accelerating the rate of extraction of their fossil fuel stocks  4  5  thus accelerating climate change 
countries that do not partake of the efforts to curb demand have a double advantage  they burn the carbon set free by the green countries  leakage effect  and they also burn the additional carbon extracted as a reaction to the announced and expected price cuts resulting from the gradual greening of environmental policies  green paradox   6  7 
sinn writes in his abstract that    demand reduction strategies  simply depress the world price of carbon and induce the environmental sinners to consume what the kyoto countries have economized on  even worse  if suppliers feel threatened by a gradual greening of economic policies in the kyoto countries that would damage their future prices  they will extract their stocks more rapidly  thus accelerating global warming   8 
sinn emphasizes that a condition for the green paradox is that the resource be scarce in the sense that its price will always be higher than the unit extraction and exploration costs combined  he points out that this condition is likely to be satisfied as backstop technologies will at best offer a perfect substitute for electricity  but not for fossil fuels  the prices of coal and crude oil are currently many times higher than the corresponding exploration and extraction costs combined 
practicable solutions edit 
an effective climate policy must perforce focus on the hitherto neglected supply side of the carbon market in addition to the demand side  the ways proposed as practicable by sinn include levying a withholding tax on the capital gains on the financial investments of fossil fuel resource owners  or the establishment of a seamless global emissions trading system that would effectively put a cap on worldwide fossil fuel consumption  thereby achieving the desired reduction in carbon extraction rates 
a suggestion for a solution might also be to pay suppliers for the destruction of fossil fuels  or transform them into raw material  not fuel   thus making sure that on the demand side the independancy for fossil fuels still pays off  while there is reduction in carbon extraction 
works on the subject edit 
hans-werner sinns ideas on the green paradox have been presented in detail in a number of scientific articles  9  10  his 2007 thnen lecture 11  at the annual meeting of the verein fr socialpolitik  his 2007 presidential address to the international institute of public finance in warwick  two working papers  12  13  and a german-language book  das grne paradoxon  2008   14  they build on his earlier studies on supply reactions of the owners of natural resources to announced price changes  15  16
