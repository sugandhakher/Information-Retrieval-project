m  giganteus edit 
main article  miscanthus giganteus
the sterile hybrid between m  sinensis and m  sacchariflorus  miscanthus giganteus  has been trialed as a biofuel in europe since the early 1980s  it can grow to heights of more than 3.5 m in one growth season  its dry weight annual yield can reach 25 tonnes per hectare  10 tonnes per acre   8  it is sometimes called  elephant grass   so is thus confused with the african grass pennisetum purpureum  also called that 
the rapid growth  low mineral content  and high biomass yield of miscanthus make it a favorite choice as a biofuel  9  miscanthus can be used as input for ethanol production  often outperforming corn and other alternatives in terms of biomass and gallons of ethanol produced  additionally  after harvest  it can be burned to produce heat and steam for power turbines  in addition to the amount of co2 emissions from burning the crop  any fossil fuels that might have been used in planting  fertilizing  harvesting  and processing the crop  as well as in transporting the biofuel to the point of use  must also be considered when evaluating its carbon load  its advantage  though  is that it is not usually consumed by humans  making it a more available crop for ethanol and biofuel  than  say  corn and sugarcane  when mixed 50 -50  with coal  miscanthus biomass can be used in some current coal-burning power plants without modifications 
m  sinensis edit 
winter miscanthus  an ornamental grass  growing in southern ontario  canada
main article  miscanthus sinensis
m  sinensis is cultivated as an ornamental plant  in japan  where it is known as susuki     it is considered an iconic plant of late summer and early autumn  it is mentioned in man ysh  viii 1538  as one of the seven autumn flowers  aki no nana kusa     it is used for the eighth month in hanafuda playing cards  it is decorated with bush clover for the mid-autumn festival  miscanthus has also excellent fiber properties for papermaking
