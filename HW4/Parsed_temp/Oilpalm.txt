description edit 
mature palms are single-stemmed  and can grow well over 20m  66ft  tall  the leaves are pinnate  and reach between 35m  1016ft  long  the flowers are produced in dense clusters  each individual flower is small  with three sepals and three petals 
the palm fruit is reddish  about the size of a large plum  and grows in large bunches  each fruit is made up of an oily  fleshy outer layer  the pericarp   with a single seed  the palm kernel   also rich in oil 
species edit 
the two species  e  guineensis and e  oleifera can produce fertile hybrids  the genome of e  guineensis has been sequenced  which has important implications for breeding improved strains of the crop plants  4 
commercial palm oil cultivation edit 
main article  palm oil
since palm oil contains more saturated fats than oils made from canola  corn  linseed  soybeans  safflower  and sunflowers  it can withstand extreme deep-frying heat and resists oxidation  5  it contains no trans fat  and its use in food has increased as food-labelling laws have changed to specify trans fat content  oil from elaeis guineensis is also used as biofuel 
human use of oil palms may date back about 5,000 years in coastal west africa  palm oil was also discovered in the late 19th century by archaeologists in a tomb at abydos dating back to 3000 bce  6  it is thought that arab traders brought the oil palm to egypt  7 
elaeis guineensis is now extensively cultivated in tropical countries outside africa  particularly malaysia and indonesia which together produce most of the world supply  palm oil plantations are under increasing scrutiny for social and environmental harm  particularly because rainforests with high biodiversity are destroyed  greenhouse gas output is increased  and because people are displaced by unscrupulous palm-oil enterprises  especially in indonesia  there is also growing pressure for palm oil producers to prove that they are not harming rare animals in the cultivation process  8
