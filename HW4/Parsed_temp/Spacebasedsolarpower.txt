nasa suntower concept 
space-based solar power  sbsp  is the concept of collecting solar power in space  using an  sps   that is  a  solar-power satellite  or a  satellite power system   for use on earth  it has been in research since the early 1970s  1  2 
sbsp would differ from current solar collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on earth s surface  some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing atmosphere and night time in space 
part of the solar energy  5560   is lost on its way through the atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption  space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere  avoiding these losses  and the downtime  and cosine losses  for fixed flat-plate collectors  due to the earth s rotation 
besides the cost of implementing such a system  sbsp also introduces several new hurdles  primarily the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to earth s surface for use  since wires extending from earth s surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology  sbsp designs generally include the use of some manner of wireless power transmission  the collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board  powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter  and focus its beam toward a collector  rectenna  on earth s surface  radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become concerns for sbsp 
sbsp is considered a form of sustainable or green energy  renewable energy  and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals  it is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion  such as peak oil  
sbsp is being actively pursued by japan and china  in 2008 japan passed its basic space law which established space solar power as a national goal 3  and jaxa has a roadmap to commercial sbsp  in 2015 the china academy for space technology  cast  briefed their roadmap at the international space development conference  isdc  where they showcased their road map to a 1 gw commercial system in 2050 and unveiled a video and description of their design  a proposal for the united states to lead in space solar power has recently received high level attention after it won the d3  diplomacy  development  defense  competition sponsored by the secretary of defense  secretary of state  and usaid director  4  as of may 21  2015  there was an active petition on change org and a second active petition at whitehouse website

history edit 
a laser pilot beam guides the microwave power transmission to a rectenna 
the national space society maintains an extensive space solar power library of all major historical documents and studies associated with space solar power  and major news articles 
in 1941  science fiction writer isaac asimov published the science fiction short story  reason   in which a space station transmits energy collected from the sun to various planets using microwave beams  the sbsp concept  originally known as satellite solar-power system  ssps   was first described in november 1968  5  in 1973 peter glaser was granted u s  patent number 3,781,647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances  e g  from an sps to earth s surface  using microwaves from a very large antenna  up to one square kilometer  on the satellite to a much larger one  now known as a rectenna  on the ground  6 
glaser then was a vice president at arthur d  little  inc  nasa signed a contract with adl to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974  they found that  while the concept had several major problems chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research  7 
between 1978 and 1986  the congress authorized the department of energy  doe  and nasa to jointly investigate the concept  they organized the satellite power system concept development and evaluation program  8  9  the study remains the most extensive performed to date  budget  50 million   10  several reports were published investigating the engineering feasibility of such an engineering project  they include

discontinuation edit 
the project was not continued with the change in administrations after the 1980 us federal elections  the office of technology assessment concluded that  too little is currently known about the technical  economic  and environmental aspects of sps to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment  in addition  without further research an sps demonstration or systems-engineering verification program would be a high-risk venture   28 
in 1997 nasa conducted its  fresh look  study to examine the modern state of sbsp feasibility  in assessing  what has changed  since the doe study  nasa asserted that the  us national space policy now calls for nasa to make significant investments in technology  not a particular vehicle  to drive the costs of eto  earth to orbit  transportation down dramatically  this is  of course  an absolute requirement of space solar power   29 
conversely  dr  pete worden claimed that space-based solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the arizona desert  with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit  dr  worden referred to possible solutions as speculative  and that would not be available for decades at the earliest  30 
on nov 2  2012  china proposed space collaboration with india that mentioned sbsp          may be space-based solar power initiative so that both india and china can work for long term association with proper funding along with other willing space faring nations to bring space solar power to earth   31

main article  space solar power exploratory research and technology program
sert sandwich concept nasa
in 1999  nasa s space solar power exploratory research and technology program  sert  was initiated for the following purposes 
perform design studies of selected flight demonstration concepts 
evaluate studies of the general feasibility  design  and requirements 
create conceptual designs of subsystems that make use of advanced ssp technologies to benefit future space or terrestrial applications 
formulate a preliminary plan of action for the u s   working with international partners  to undertake an aggressive technology initiative 
construct technology development and demonstration roadmaps for critical space solar power  ssp  elements 
sert went about developing a solar power satellite  sps  concept for a future gigawatt space power system  to provide electrical power by converting the sun s energy and beaming it to earth s surface  and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies  sert proposed an inflatable photovoltaic gossamer structure with concentrator lenses or solar heat engines to convert sunlight into electricity  the program looked both at systems in sun-synchronous orbit and geosynchronous orbit  some of sert s conclusions 
the increasing global energy demand is likely to continue for many decades resulting in new power plants of all sizes being built 
the environmental impact of those plants and their impact on world energy supplies and geopolitical relationships can be problematic 
renewable energy is a compelling approach  both philosophically and in engineering terms 
many renewable energy sources are limited in their ability to affordably provide the base load power required for global industrial development and prosperity  because of inherent land and water requirements 
based on their concept definition study  space solar power concepts may be ready to reenter the discussion 
solar power satellites should no longer be envisioned as requiring unimaginably large initial investments in fixed infrastructure before the emplacement of productive power plants can begin 
space solar power systems appear to possess many significant environmental advantages when compared to alternative approaches 
the economic viability of space solar power systems depends on many factors and the successful development of various new technologies  not least of which is the availability of much lower cost access to space than has been available   however  the same can be said of many other advanced power technologies options 
space solar power may well emerge as a serious candidate among the options for meeting the energy demands of the 21st century  space solar power satellite technology development at the glenn research centeran overview  james e  dudenhoefer and patrick j  george  nasa glenn research center  cleveland  ohio 
launch costs in the range of  100 200 per kilogram of payload to low earth orbit are needed if sps are to be economically viable  10 
japan aerospace exploration agency edit 
the may 2014 ieee spectrum magazine carried a lengthy article  it s always sunny in space  by dr  susumu sasaki  32  the article stated   it s been the subject of many previous studies and the stuff of sci-fi for decades  but space-based solar power could at last become a realityand within 25 years  according to a proposal from researchers at the tokyo-based japan aerospace exploration agency  jaxa   
jaxa announced on 12 march 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity  this is the standard plan for this type of power  33  34  on 12 march 2015 mitsubishi heavy industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts  kw  of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters  m  away  35 
challenges edit 
potential edit 
the sbsp concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the earth s surface for the collection of solar power 
its always solar noon in space and full sun 
collecting surfaces could receive much more intense sunlight  owing to the lack of obstructions such as atmospheric gasses  clouds  dust and other weather events  consequently  the intensity in orbit is approximately 144  of the maximum attainable intensity on earth s surface  citation needed 
a satellite could be illuminated over 99  of the time  and be in earth s shadow a maximum of only 72 minutes per night at the spring and fall equinoxes at local midnight  36  orbiting satellites can be exposed to a consistently high degree of solar radiation  generally for 24 hours per day  whereas the average earth surface solar panels currently collect power for an average of 29  per day  37 
power could be relatively quickly redirected directly to areas that need it most  a collecting satellite could possibly direct power on demand to different surface locations based on geographical baseload or peak load power needs  typical contracts would be for baseload  continuous power  since peaking power is ephemeral  citation needed 
elimination of plant and wildlife interference 
with very large scale implementations  especially at lower altitudes  it potentially can reduce incoming solar radiation reaching earth s surface  this would be desirable for counteracting the effects of global warming 
drawbacks edit 
the sbsp concept also has a number of problems 
the large cost of launching a satellite into space
inaccessibility  maintenance of an earth-based solar panel is relatively simple  but construction and maintenance on a solar panel in space would typically be done telerobotically  in addition to cost  astronauts working in geo orbit are exposed to unacceptably high radiation dangers and risk and cost about one thousand times more than the same task done telerobotically 
the space environment is hostile  panels suffer about 8 times the degradation they would on earth  except at orbits that are protected by the magnetosphere   38 
space debris is a major hazard to large objects in space  and all large structures such as sbsp systems have been mentioned as potential sources of orbital debris  39 
the broadcast frequency of the microwave downlink  if used  would require isolating the sbsp systems away from other satellites  geo space is already well used and it is considered unlikely the itu would allow an sps to be launched  40 
the large size and corresponding cost of the receiving station on the ground  citation needed 
energy losses during several phases of conversion from  photon to electron to photon back to electron   as elon musk has stated  41 
design edit 
artist s concept of a solar disk on top of a leo to geo electrically powered space tug 
space-based solar power essentially consists of three elements  2 
collecting solar energy in space with reflectors or inflatable mirrors onto solar cells
wireless power transmission to earth via microwave or laser
receiving power on earth via a rectenna  a microwave antenna
the space-based portion will not need to support itself against gravity  other than relatively weak tidal stresses   it needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather  but will have to cope with space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares  two basic methods of conversion have been studied  photovoltaic  pv  and solar dynamic  sd   most analyses of sbsp have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity  solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler  the use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt  wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the earth s surface  using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies 
there is an annual international sunsat design competition hosted by ohio university 
microwave power transmission edit 
william c  brown demonstrated in 1964  during walter cronkite s cbs news program  a microwave-powered model helicopter that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam  between 1969 and 1975  bill brown was technical director of a jpl raytheon program that beamed 30 kw of power over a distance of 1 mile  1.6km  at 84  efficiency  42 
microwave power transmission of tens of kilowatts has been well proven by existing tests at goldstone in california  1975  42  43  44  and grand bassin on reunion island  1997   45 
comparison of laser and microwave power transmission  nasa diagram
more recently  microwave power transmission has been demonstrated  in conjunction with solar energy capture  between a mountain top in maui and the island of hawaii  92 miles away   by a team under john c  mankins  46  47  technological challenges in terms of array layout  single radiation element design  and overall efficiency  as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research  as it is demonstrated by the special session on  analysis of electromagnetic wireless systems for solar power transmission  to be held in the 2010 ieee symposium on antennas and propagation  48  in 2013  a useful overview was published  covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground  it includes an introduction to sps  current research and future prospects  49  moreover  a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the proceedings of the ieee  50 
laser power beaming edit 
laser power beaming was envisioned by some at nasa as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space  in the 1980s  researchers at nasa worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming  focusing primarily on the development of a solar-powered laser  in 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from earth to space  in 1991 the selene project  space laser energy  had begun  which included the study of laser power beaming for supplying power to a lunar base  the selene program was a two-year research effort  but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high  and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration  51 
in 1988 the use of an earth-based laser to power an electric thruster for space propulsion was proposed by grant logan  with technical details worked out in 1989  he proposed using diamond solar cells operating at 600 degrees to convert ultraviolet laser light 
orbital location edit 
the main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant  and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler  another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit  other space-based power stations have much longer start-up times before they are producing nearly continuous power  a collection of leo  low earth orbit  space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to geo  geostationary orbit  space-based solar power  52 
earth-based receiver edit 
the earth-based rectenna would likely consist of many short dipole antennas connected via diodes  microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85  efficiency  53  with a conventional microwave antenna  the reception efficiency is better  but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater  rectennas would likely be several kilometers across 
in space applications edit 
a laser sbsp could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the moon or mars  saving on mass costs to land the power source  a spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means  in a 2012 report presented to nasa on space solar power  the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind space solar power could be for solar electric propulsion systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions  54  55  56 
launch costs edit 
one problem for the sbsp concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched  reusable launch systems are predicted to provide lower launch costs to low earth orbit  leo   57  58  as of november 2013 update   one company  spacex  is two years along on a privately funded multi-year development program for a reusable rocket launching system with the stated intention to commercialize  fully and rapidly reusable  launch technology  59  60  61  spacex has completed eight test flights of their low-altitude booster return prototype  grasshopper  62  and one test flight of a high-altitude high-velocity booster return test vehicle  with a second booster return test flight planned for early 2014  63  64 
much of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately  which raises the possibility that high efficiency  but slower  engines could move sps material from leo to geo at an acceptable cost  examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion  power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required  optical aperture  sizes are very large  for example  the 1978 nasa sps study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna  and a 10km diameter receiving rectenna  for a microwave beam at 2.45ghz  these sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths  although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets  because of the thinned array curse  it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites  the large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an sps will necessarily be high  small sps systems will be possible  but uneconomic 
to give an idea of the scale of the problem  assuming a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt  without considering the mass of the supporting structure  antenna  or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors  a 4 gw power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons  all of which would  in current circumstances  be launched from the earth  very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg kw  65  meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 gw capacity station  this would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle  hllv  launches to send the material to low earth orbit  where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays  which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to  slowly  reach geo  geostationary orbit   with an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based hllvs of  500 million to  800 million  and launch costs for alternative hllvs at  78 million  total launch costs would range between  11 billion  low cost hllv  low weight panels  and  320 billion   expensive  hllv  heavier panels   citation needed  to these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions  if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production  for comparison  the direct cost of a new coal 66  or nuclear power plant ranges from  3 billion to  6 billion per gw  not including the full cost to the environment from co2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel  respectively   another example is the apollo missions to the moon cost a grand total of  24 billion  1970s  dollars   taking inflation into account  would cost  140 billion today  more expensive than the construction of the international space station 
however  in 2013 based on recent innovations  electric space  space-based solar power technologies   applications suggested a new way to reduce costs by replacing smaller satellites and in lower orbits  67 
building from space edit 
from lunar materials launched in orbit edit 
gerard o neill  noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s  proposed building the sps s in orbit with materials from the moon  68  launch costs from the moon are potentially much lower than from earth  due to the lower gravity and lack of atmospheric drag  this 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of nasa s space shuttle  this approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish mass drivers on the moon  69  nevertheless  on 30 april 1979  the final report   lunar resources utilization for space construction   by general dynamics  convair division  under nasa contract nas9-15560  concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty solar power satellites of 10gw capacity each  70 
in 1980  when it became obvious nasa s launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic  o neill et al  published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs  71  this 1980s sps concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially self-replicating systems on the lunar surface under remote control of workers stationed on earth  the high net energy gain of this proposal derives from the moon s much shallower gravitational well 
having a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of sps being built  the low cost per pound of lunar materials in o neill s vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites  advanced techniques for launching from the moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials  some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the lunar space elevator  first described by jerome pearson  72  it would require establishing silicon mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the moon  citation needed 
on the moon edit 
david criswell suggests the moon is the optimum location for solar power stations  and promotes lunar solar power  73  74  the main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials  using in-situ resource utilization  with a teleoperated mobile factory and crane to assemble the microwave reflectors  and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells  75  which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to sbsp designs  power relay satellites orbiting around earth and the moon reflecting the microwave beam are also part of the project  a demo project of 1 gw starts at  50 billion  76  the shimizu corporation use combination of lasers and microwave for the lunar ring concept  along with power relay satellites  77  78 
from an asteroid edit 
asteroid mining has also been seriously considered  a nasa design study 79  evaluated a 10,000 ton mining vehicle  to be assembled in orbit  that would return a 500,000 ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit  only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload  the rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine  which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload  assuming that 100  of the returned asteroid was useful  and that the asteroid miner itself couldn t be reused  that represents nearly a 95  reduction in launch costs  however  the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids  thus far  we have only estimates of their composition  80  one proposal is to capture the asteroid apophis into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 gw each or the larger asteroid 1999 an10 which is 50x the size of apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-gigawatt solar power satellites 81

counter arguments edit 
safety edit 
the use of microwave transmission of power has been the most controversial issue in considering any sps design  at the earth s surface  a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center  of 23mw cm2  less than 1/4 the solar irradiation constant   and an intensity of less than 1mw cm2 outside the rectenna fenceline  the receiver s perimeter   82  these compare with current united states occupational safety and health act  osha  workplace exposure limits for microwaves  which are 10mw cm2  83  - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for federal osha enforcement purposes  citation needed  a beam of this intensity is therefore at its center  of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels  even for long term or indefinite exposure  outside the receiver  it is far less than the osha long-term levels 84  over 95  of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna  the remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world  85  it is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna  outside the rectenna  microwave intensities rapidly decrease  so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected  86 
exposure to the beam is able to be minimized in other ways  on the ground  physical access is controllable  e g   via fencing   and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell  i e   a faraday cage   which will intercept the microwaves  other aircraft  balloons  ultralight  etc   can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces  as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace  the microwave beam intensity at ground level in the center of the beam would be designed and physically built into the system  simply  the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels  even in principle 
in addition  a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife  particularly birds  experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations  87  suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore  88  89  but this presents serious problems  including corrosion  mechanical stresses  and biological contamination 
a commonly proposed approach to ensuring fail-safe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective phased array antenna rectenna  a  pilot  microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna  there  circuits in each of the antenna s subarrays compare the pilot beam s phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal  this forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity  if the pilot beam is lost for any reason  if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna  for example  the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused  86  such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter  the long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied  but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect

non-typical configurations and architectural considerations edit 
the typical reference system-of-systems involves a significant number  several thousand multi-gigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of earth s energy requirements  of individual satellites in geo  the typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 1-10 gw range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltics  pv  as the energy collector   conversion  the most typical transmission designs are in the 110ghz  2.45 or 5.8ghz  rf band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere  materials for the satellites are sourced from  and manufactured on earth and expected to be transported to leo via re-usable rocket launch  and transported between leo and geo via chemical or electrical propulsion  in summary  the architecture choices are 
location   geo
energy collection   pv
satellite   monolithic structure
transmission   rf
materials   manufacturing   earth
installation   rlvs to leo  chemical to geo
there are several interesting design variants from the reference system 
alternate energy collection location  while geo is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to earth  simplified pointing and tracking  very small time in occultation  and scalability to meet all global demand several times over  other locations have been proposed 
sun earth l1  robert kennedy iii  ken roy   david fields have proposed a variant of the l1 sunshade called  dyson dot s  where a multi-terrawatt primary collector would beam energy back to a series of leo sun-synchronous receiver satellites  the much farther distance to earth requires a correspondingly larger transmission aperture 
lunar surface  dr  david criswell has proposed using the lunar surface itself as the collection medium  beaming power to the ground via a series of microwave reflectors in earth orbit  the chief advantage of this approach would be the ability to manufacture the solar collectors in-situ without the energy cost and complexity of launch  disadvantages include the much longer distance  requiring larger transmission systems  the required  overbuild  to deal with the lunar night  and the difficulty of sufficient manufacturing and pointing of reflector satellites 
meo  meo systems have been proposed for in-space utilities and beam-power propulsion infrastructures  for example  see royce jones  paper 
highly elliptical orbits  molniya  tundra  or quazi zenith orbits have been proposed as early locations for niche markets  requiring less energy to access and providing good persistence  for example  see kevin reed s qgso proposal  slide 25  
sun-sync leo  in this near polar orbit  the satellites precess at a rate that allows them to always face the sun as they rotate around earth  this is an easy to access orbit requiring far less energy  and its proximity to earth requires smaller  and therefore less massive  transmitting apertures  however disadvantages to this approach include having to constantly shift receiving stations  or storing energy for a burst transmission  this orbit is already crowded and has significant space debris 
equatorial leo  japan s sps 2000 proposed an early demonstrator in equatorial leo in which multiple equatorial participating nations could receive some power 
earth s surface  dr  narayan komerath has proposed a space power grid where excess energy from an existing grid or power plant on one side of the planet can be passed up to orbit  across to another satellite and down to receivers 
energy collection  the most typical designs for solar power satellites include photovoltaics  these may be planar  and usually passively cooled   concentrated  and perhaps actively cooled   however  there are multiple interesting variants 
solar thermal  proponents of solar thermal have proposed using concentrated heating to cause a state change in a fluid to extract energy via rotating machinery followed by cooling in radiators  advantages of this method might include overall system mass  disputed   non-degradation due to solar-wind damage  and radiation tolerance  one recent thermal solar power satellite design by keith henson has been visualized here 
solar pumped laser  japan has pursued a solar-pumped laser  where sunlight directly excites the lasing medium used to create the coherent beam to earth 
fusion decay  this version of a power-satellite is not  solar   rather  the vacuum of space is seen as a  feature not a bug  for traditional fusion  per dr  paul werbos  after fusion even neutral particles decay to charged particles which in a sufficiently large volume would allow direct conversion to current 
solar wind loop  also called a dyson-haroop satellite  here the satellite makes use not of the photons from the sun but rather the charged particles in the solar wind which via electro-magnetic coupling generate a current in a large loop 
direct mirrors  early concepts for direct mirror re-direction of light to planet earth suffered from the problem that rays coming from the sun are not parallel but are expanding from a disk and so the size of the spot on the earth is quite large  dr  lewis fraas has explored an array of parbolic mirrors to augment existing solar arrays 
alternate satellite architecture  the typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss  one or more collectors  one or more transmitters  and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors  the entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized  alternative designs include 
swarms of smaller satellites  some designs propose swarms of free-flying smaller satellites  this is the case with several laser designs  and appears to be the case with caltech s flying carpets  for rf designs  an engineering constraint is the sparse array problem 
free floating components  solaren has proposed an alternative to the monolithic structure where the primary reflector and transmission reflector are free-flying 
spin stabilization  nasa explored a spin-stabilized thin film concept 
photonic laser thruster  plt  stabilized structure  dr  young bae has proposed that photon pressure may substitute for compressive members in large structures 
transmission  the most typical design for energy transmission is via an rf antenna at below 10ghz to a rectenna on the ground  controversy exists between the benefits of klystrons  gyrotrons  magnetrons and solid state  alternate transmission approaches include 
laser  lasers offer the advantage of much lower cost and mass to first power  however there is controversy regarding benefits of efficiency  lasers allow for much smaller transmitting and receiving apertures  however  a highly concentrated beam has eye-safety  fire safety  and weaponization concerns  proponents believe they have answers to all these concerns  a laser-based approach must also find alternate ways of coping with precipitation 
atmospheric waveguide  some have proposed it may be possible to use a short pulse laser to create an atmospheric waveguide through which concentrated microwaves could flow  3  116 
scalar  some have even speculated it may be possible to transmit power through scalar waves 
materials and manufacturing  typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on earth  and use earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant  variants include 
lunar materials  designs exist for solar power satellites that source  99  of materials from lunar regolith with very small inputs of  vitamins  from other locations  using materials from the moon is attractive because launch from the moon is in theory far less complicated than from earth  there is no atmosphere  and so components do not need to be packed tightly in an aeroshell and survive vibration  pressure and temperature loads  launch may be via a magnetic mass driver and the requirement to use propellant for launch entirely  launch from the moon the geo also requires far less energy than from earth s much deeper gravity well  building all the solar power satellites to fully supply all the required energy for the entire planet requires less than one millionth of the mass of the moon 
self-replication on the moon  nasa explored a self-replicating factory on the moon in 1980  more recently  justin lewis-webber proposed a method of speciated manufacture of core elements based upon john mankins sps-alpha design 
asteroidal materials  some asteroids are thought to have even lower delta-v to recover materials than the moon  and some particular materials of interest such as metals may be more concentrated or easier to access 
in-space in-situ manufacturing  with the advent of in-space additive manufacturing  concepts such as spiderfab might allow mass launch of raw materials for local extrusion 
method of installation   transportation of material to energy collection location  in the reference designs  component material is launched via well-understood chemical rockets  usually fully reusable launch systems  to leo  after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to geo  the desired characteristics for this system is very high mass-flow at low total cost  alternate concepts include 
lunar chemical launch  ula has recently showcased a concept for a fully re-usable chemical lander xeus to move materials from the lunar surface to llo or geo 
lunar mass driver  launch of materials from the lunar surface using a system similar to an aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult  an unexplored compact alternative would be the slingatron 
lunar space elevator  an equatorial or near-equatorial cable extends to and through the lagrange point  this is claimed by proponents to be lower in mass than a traditional mass driver 
space elevator  a ribbon of pure carbon nanotubes extends from its center of gravity in geostationary orbit  allowing climbers to climb up to geo  problems with this include the material challenge of creating a ribbon of such length with adequate strength  management of collisions with satellites and space debris  and lightning 
meo skyhook  as part of an afrl study  roger lenard proposed a meo skyhook  it appears that a gravity gradient-stabilized tether with its center of mass in meo can be constructed of available materials  the bottom of the skyhook is close to the atmosphere in a  non-keplerian orbit   a re-usable rocket can launch to match altitude and speed with the bottom of the tether which is in a non-keplerian orbit  travelling much slower than typical orbital speed   the payload is transferred and it climbs the cable  the cable itself is kept from de-orbiting via electric propusion and or electromagnetic effects 
maglev launch   startram  john powell has a concept for a very high mass-flow system  in a first-gen system  built into a mountain  accelerates a payload through an evacuated maglev track  a small on-board rocket circulizes the payload 
beamed energy launch  kevin parkin and escape dynamics both have concepts for ground-based irradiation of a mono-propellant launch vehicle using rf energy  the rf energy is absorbed and directly heats the propellant not unlike in nerva-style nuclear-thermal  lasermotive has a concept for a laser-based approach 
in fiction edit 
space stations transmitting solar power have appeared in science-fiction works like isaac asimov s  reason   1941   that centers around the troubles caused by the robots operating the station  asimov s short story  the last question  also features the use of sbsp to provide limitless energy for use on earth  ben bova s thriller powersat involves a billionaire bent on creating a solar powersat while others try to sabotage it 
in the video game sid meier s alpha centauri  the player can construct a city improvement called an  orbital power transmitter  which  while expensive  provides energy to all other cities  constructing many of these results in huge bonuses to energy production for all cities the player owns  in the novel  skyfall   1976  by harry harrison an attempt to launch the core of powersat from cape canaveral ends in disaster when the launch vehicle fails trapping the payload in a decaying orbit  several simcity games have featured space-microwave power plants as buildable options for municipal energy  along with  unrealistic  disaster scenarios where the beam strays off the collector and sets fire to nearby areas  in the manga and anime mobile suit gundam 00  an orbital ring containing multiple solar collectors and microwave transmitters  along with power stations and space elevators for carrying power back down to earth s surface  are the primary source of electricity for the earth in the 24th century 
various aerospace companies have also showcased imaginative future solar power satellites in their corporate vision videos  including the boeing you just wait  lockheed martin s the next 100 years  and united launch alliance cis-lunar 1000
