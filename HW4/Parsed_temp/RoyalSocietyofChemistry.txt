the society is organised around 9 divisions  based on subject areas  and local sections  both in the united kingdom and overseas  divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas 
analytical division for analytical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the society for analytical chemistry  12 subject groups 
dalton division  named after john dalton  for inorganic chemistry  6 subject groups 
education division for chemical education  4 subject groups 
faraday division  named after michael faraday  for physical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the faraday society  14 subject groups 
organic division for organic chemistry  6 subject groups

website
www rsc org
the london offices of the society are in burlington house  piccadilly  events are hosted here for the public  rsc member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the rsc s public engagement website  the reaction  the free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music 
the events have attracted notable science writers such as philip ball  antony john williams  and john emsley to give public lectures  most of these are available as archived video streams via the rsc s reaction website  22 
history edit 
although opened as the chemistry centre in 2010  the building has been occupied by the royal society of chemistry since 1857  at which time it was known as the chemical society   the heart of the chemistry centre is the rsc s library and information centre which itself dates back to 1842  over the years  the library for the rsc has received many gifts from notable fellows including michael faraday  the library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available  in november 2014  the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply  royal society of chemistry at burlington house  and the name  chemistry centre  dropped 
library and information centre edit 
the society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects  including online access for members  housed at the chemistry centre at burlington house  it is part of the chemistry centre and is a resource for rsc members  although the public are also welcome 
benevolent fund edit 
the staircase at the royal society of chemistry  burlington house  designed by the partnership of robert richardson banks and charles barry  jr 
the royal society of chemistry s benevolent fund supports the members and their families during difficult times  through advice and guidance  financial support and volunteer support  23  it dates back to 1920 when the institute of chemistry  later the royal institute of chemistry  established it as a memorial to its members who died in the first world war  it had an aim  to help necessitous persons who are  or have been  fellows or associates of the institute  their wives or children  and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased fellows and associates  through voluntary contributions from members  the benevolent fund s ethos of  members helping members  stems from the institute of chemistry s council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed  24 
in 1960  the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system  where members were asked to visit applicants  beneficiaries  elderly and housebound members in their area  each local section was also appointed a fund representative  25 
a major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003-2004  forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years  it underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to royal society of chemistry members and their families  26 
the benevolent fund committee  formed of volunteer members of the royal society of chemistry  oversees the benevolent fund and meet every three months  27 
prizes and awards edit 
main article  list of royal society of chemistry medals and awards
the rsc awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry  in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemist s career  28 
medals are awarded centrally by the rsc and by the divisions of the organisation  there are also awards that are administered by rsc interest groups 
the centrally awarded medals include the harrison-meldola memorial prizes which are awarded to a british chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry 29  and the corday-morgan medals which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry  including computer simulation   30  the tilden prize  previously known as the tilden lecture  consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry 
previous winners of the harrison-meldola prize  known as the meldola medal and prize prior to its merger in 2008 with the edward harrison prize  include christopher kelk ingold  1921  1922   cyril norman hinshelwood  1923   r h  stokes  1946   d h  williams  1966   and j  evans  1978

the faraday division annually awards the marlow award for contributions to physical chemistry or chemical physics by members of the faraday division under the age of 32  31  recent recipients include andrew orr-ewing   1999   jonathan a  jones   2000   helen fielding  2001   jonathan essex  2002   daren caruana  2003   jonathan reid  2004   julie macpherson  2005   fred manby  2006   and alessandro troisi  2007  
coat of arms edit 
the rsc has its own coat of arms  two forms exist  the full coat of arms has lion and unicorn bearers  and the latin motto  pro scientia et humanitate   for the sake of knowledge and for the benefit of mankind   the smaller version uses just the central shield  which is similar to that in the royal institute of chemistry s arms

other resources edit 
the interactive lab primer is a site developed to provide tips to a variety of chemical experimentation skills  32  the site covers basic lab safety tips  demonstrates primary lab techniques  introduces a couple common lab apparatus in lab  and provides other references 
the society s chemspider is a database of chemicals and chemical properties 
the society operates a blue plaque scheme   landmarks of chemistry   erecting plaques at places associated with notable chemical events or people  33  recent plaques are hexagonal
