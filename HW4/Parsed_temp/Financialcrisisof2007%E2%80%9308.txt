the financial crisis of 20072008  also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis  is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the great depression of the 1930s  1  2  3  4 
the precipitating factor was a high default rate in the subprime home mortgage sector  the expansion of this sector had been encouraged by the community reinvestment act  cra   a us federal law first passed in 1977 and subsequently revised  which was designed to help poorer american inner-city dwellers get mortgage loans  many of these subprime  high risk  loans were then bundled and sold  finally accruing to quasi-government agencies  fannie mae and freddie mac   the implicit guarantee by the us federal government created a moral hazard and contributed to a glut of risky lending  many of these loans were also bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities  which could be sold on as  ostensibly  low-risk securities  because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages  and the associated risks  on in this way  they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria  encouraged by regulators   and some developed aggressive lending practices  the accumulation and subsequent default of these mortgages led to the crisis 
the crisis threatened the collapse of large financial institutions  which was prevented by the bailout of banks by national governments  but stock markets still dropped worldwide  in many areas  the housing market also suffered  resulting in evictions  foreclosures and prolonged unemployment  the crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses  declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of u s  dollars  and a downturn in economic activity leading to the great recession of 20082012 and contributing to the european sovereign-debt crisis  5  6  the active phase of the crisis  which manifested as a liquidity crisis  can be dated from august 9  2007  when bnp paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing  a complete evaporation of liquidity   7 
the bursting of the u s  housing bubble  which had peaked in 2004  8  caused the values of securities tied to u s  real estate pricing to plummet  damaging financial institutions globally  9  10  the financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of policies that encouraged home ownership  providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers  overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate  questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers  compensation structures that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation  and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making  11  12  13  14  questions regarding bank solvency  declines in credit availability and damaged investor confidence affected global stock markets  where securities suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009  economies worldwide slowed during this period  as credit tightened and international trade declined  15  governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus  monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts  16  in the u s   congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 
many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested  with varying weight assigned by experts  17  the u s  senate s levincoburn report concluded that the crisis was the result of  high risk  complex financial products  undisclosed conflicts of interest  the failure of regulators  the credit rating agencies  and the market itself to rein in the excesses of wall street   18  the financial crisis inquiry commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by  widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision    dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions    a combination of excessive borrowing  risky investments  and lack of transparency  by financial institutions  ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that  added to the uncertainty and panic   a  systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics    collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline   deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives  especially credit default swaps  and  the failures of credit rating agencies  to correctly price risk  19  the 1999 repeal of the glass-steagall act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the united states  20  critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products  and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets  21  research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads  22 
in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis palliative monetary and fiscal policies were adopted to lessen the shock to the economy  23  the doddfrank regulatory reforms were enacted in the u s  to lessen the chance of a recurrence  24  and the basel iii capital and liquidity standards were adopted by countries around the world  25

background edit 
main article  causes of the great recession
the immediate cause or trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the u s a   united states of america  housing bubble  which peaked in 2004  8  already-rising default rates on  subprime  and adjustable-rate mortgages  arm  began to increase quickly thereafter  as banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners  housing prices began to rise 
easy availability of credit in the u s   fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the russian debt crisis and asian financial crisis of the 19971998 period  led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debt-financed consumer spending  lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble  loans of various types  e g   mortgage  credit card  and auto  were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load  26  27  28 
as part of the housing and credit booms  the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities  mbs  and collateralized debt obligations  cdo   which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices  greatly increased  10  such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the u s  housing market  as housing prices declined  major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime mbs reported significant losses  29 
falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan  providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosure  clarification needed  the ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the u s  and only reduced to historical levels in early 2014 30  drained significant wealth from consumers  losing up to  4.2 trillion 31  in wealth from home equity  defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy  total losses are estimated in the trillions of u s  dollars globally  29 
share in gdp of u s  financial sector since 1860 32 
while the housing and credit bubbles were building  a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile  a process called financialization  u s  government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business  which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions  thus  policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds  also known as the shadow banking system  some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial  depository  banks in providing credit to the u s  economy  but they were not subject to the same regulations  33 
these institutions  as well as certain regulated banks  had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or mbs losses  34  these losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend  slowing economic activity  concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the commercial paper markets  which are integral to funding business operations  governments also bailed out key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs  assuming significant additional financial commitments 
the u s  financial crisis inquiry commission reported its findings in january 2011  it concluded that  the crisis was avoidable and was caused by  widespread failures in financial regulation  including the federal reserves failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages  dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk  an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and wall street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis  key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis  lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw  and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels   35  36 
subprime lending edit 
main article  subprime mortgage crisis
during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share  and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited  mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers  10  in the view of some analysts  the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises  gses  policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003  however  as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power  mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated  10  the worst loans were originated in 20042007  the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses 
u s  subprime lending expanded dramatically 20042006
as well as easy credit conditions  there is evidence that competitive pressures contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis  major u s  investment banks and gses like fannie mae played an important role in the expansion of lending  with gses eventually relaxing their standards to try to catch up with the private banks  37  38 
a contrarian view is that fannie mae and freddie mac led the way to relaxed underwriting standards  starting in 1995  by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems  by designing the no-downpayment products issued by lenders  by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers  and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as countrywide  39  40 
depending on how subprime mortgages are defined  they remained below 10  of all mortgage originations until 2004  when they spiked to nearly 20  and remained there through the 20052006 peak of the united states housing bubble  41 
the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission  written by the six democratic appointees  the minority report  written by 3 of the 4 republican appointees  studies by federal reserve economists  and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis  10  although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis  they contend that gse loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks  and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios  10 
in his dissent to the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission  american enterprise institute fellow peter j  wallison 42  stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the u s  department of housing and urban development  hud  in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac  later  based upon information in the sec s december 2011 securities fraud case against 6 ex-executives of fannie and freddie  peter wallison and edward pinto estimated that  in 2008  fannie and freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over  2 trillion  43 
in the early and mid-2000s  the bush administration called numerous times 44  for investigation into the safety and soundness of the gses and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages  on september 10  2003  the house financial services committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight  ofheo  that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities  45  the hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of fannie mae and freddie mac  as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked ofheo for their attempt at regulation  46  some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the u s  financial system that went unheeded  47 
a 2000 united states department of the treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that  467billion of mortgage lending was made by community reinvestment act  cra -covered lenders into low and mid level income  lmi  borrowers and neighborhoods  representing 10  of all u s  mortgage lending during the period  the majority of these were prime loans  sub-prime loans made by cra-covered institutions constituted a 3  market share of lmi loans in 1998  48  but in the run-up to the crisis  fully 25  of all sub-prime lending occurred at cra-covered institutions and another 25  of sub-prime loans had some connection with cra  49  furthermore  most sub-prime loans were not made to the lmi borrowers targeted by the cra  especially in the years 20052006 leading up to the crisis  nor did it find any evidence that lending under the cra rules increased delinquency rates or that the cra indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending 
to other analysts the delay between cra rule changes  in 1995  and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising  and does not exonerate the cra  they contend that there were two  connected causes to the crisis  the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the federal reserve after the terrorist attack on september 11  2001  both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place  50  critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive  totaling  4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007  51  they also argue that the federal reserves classification of cra loans as prime is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans  3 percentage points over average  equal subprime loans  52 
others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude  in an article in portfolio magazine  michael lewis spoke with one trader who noted that  there werent enough americans with  bad  credit taking out  bad loans  to satisfy investors  appetite for the end product   essentially  investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made  far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans  using derivatives called credit default swaps  collateralized debt obligations and synthetic cdos  53 
as of march 2011 the fdic has had to pay out  9 billion to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions  54  the congressional budget office estimated  in june 2011  that the bailout to fannie mae and freddie mac exceeds  300 billion  calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time   55 
economist paul krugman argued in january 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that fannie mae  freddie mac  cra  or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis  in other words  bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes  56 
countering krugman  peter j  wallison wrote   it is not true that every bubbleeven a large bubblehas the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates   wallison notes that other developed countries had  large bubbles during the 19972007 period  but  the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the 19972007  bubble  deflated   according to wallison  the reason the u s  residential housing bubble  as opposed to other types of bubbles  led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans  generally with low or no downpayments  57 
krugman s contention  that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that u s  housing policy was not the cause of the crisis  is challenged by additional analysis  after researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis  xudong an and anthony b  sanders reported  in december 2010    we find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in cmbs  commercial mortgage-backed securities  loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis   58  other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate  business journalist kimberly amadeo reports   the first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006  three years later  commercial real estate started feeling the effects  59  denice a  gierach  a real estate attorney and cpa  wrote 
   most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy  in other words  the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad  it was the economy  60 
growth of the housing bubble edit 
main article  united states housing bubble
a graph showing the median and average sales prices of new homes sold in the united states between 1963 and 2008  not adjusted for inflation  61 
between 1998 and 2006  the price of the typical american house increased by 124   62  during the two decades ending in 2001  the national median home price ranged from 2.9 to 3.1 times median household income  this ratio rose to 4.0 in 2004  and 4.6 in 2006  63  this housing bubble resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates  or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation 
in a peabody award winning program  npr correspondents argued that a  giant pool of money   represented by  70trillion in worldwide fixed income investments  sought higher yields than those offered by u s  treasury bonds early in the decade  this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007  yet the supply of relatively safe  income generating investments had not grown as fast  investment banks on wall street answered this demand with products such as the mortgage-backed security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies  64 
in effect  wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the u s   with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain  from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them  by approximately 2003  the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted  and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards  64 
the collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending  extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees  this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority  those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies  securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested  65  66 
by september 2008  average u s  housing prices had declined by over 20  from their mid-2006 peak  67  68  as prices declined  borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default  during 2007  lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3million properties  a 79  increase over 2006  69  this increased to 2.3million in 2008  an 81  increase vs  2007  70  by august 2008  9.2  of all u s  mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure  71  by september 2009  this had risen to 14.4   72 
easy credit conditions edit 
lower interest rates encouraged borrowing  from 2000 to 2003  the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5  to 1.0   73  this was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the september 2001 terrorist attacks  as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation  74  as early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the fed  needs to create a housing bubble to replace the nasdaq bubble   75  moreover  empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis  76 
u s  current account deficit 
additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by the high and rising u s  current account deficit  which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006  federal reserve chairman ben bernanke explained how trade deficits required the u s  to borrow money from abroad  in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates  77 
bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004  the u s  current account deficit increased by  650billion  from 1.5  to 5.8  of gdp  financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad  much of it from countries running trade surpluses  these were mainly the emerging economies in asia and oil-exporting nations  the balance of payments identity requires that a country  such as the u s   running a current account deficit also have a capital account  investment  surplus of the same amount  hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds  capital  flowed into the u s  to finance its imports 
all of this created demand for various types of financial assets  raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates  foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates  as high as 40  in china  or because of high oil prices  ben bernanke has referred to this as a  saving glut   78 
a flood of funds  capital or liquidity  reached the u s  financial markets  foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis  u s  households  on the other hand  used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets  financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgage-backed securities 
the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july 2004 and july 2006  79  this contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable-rate mortgage  arm  rates  making arm interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners  80  this may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble  as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates  and it became riskier to speculate in housing  81  82  u s  housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst  83  84 
weak and fraudulent underwriting practices edit 
testimony given to the financial crisis inquiry commission by richard m  bowen iii on events during his tenure as the business chief underwriter for correspondent lending in the consumer lending group for citigroup  where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters  suggests that by the final years of the u s  housing bubble  20062007   the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic  his testimony stated that by 2006  60  of mortgages purchased by citi from some 1,600 mortgage companies were  defective   were not underwritten to policy  or did not contain all policy-required documents   this  despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible  certified via representations and warrantees  that its mortgage originations met citi s standards  moreover  during 2007   defective mortgages  from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to citi s standards  increased    to over 80  of production   85 
in separate testimony to financial crisis inquiry commission  officers of clayton holdingsthe largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the united states and europetestified that clayton s review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from january 2006 to june 2007 revealed that scarcely 54  of the loans met their originators underwriting standards  the analysis  conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks  including 7  too big to fail  banks  additionally showed that 28  of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer  clayton s analysis further showed that 39  of these loans  i e  those not meeting any issuer s minimal underwriting standards  were subsequently securitized and sold to investors  86  87 
there is strong evidence that the gses  due to their large size and market power  were far more effective at policing underwriting by originators and forcing underwriters to repurchase defective loans  by contrast  private securitizers have been far less aggressive and less effective in recovering losses from originators on behalf of investors  10 
predatory lending edit 
predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders  enticing borrowers to enter into  unsafe  or  unsound  secured loans for inappropriate purposes  88  a classic bait-and-switch method was used by countrywide financial  advertising low interest rates for home refinancing  such loans were written into extensively detailed contracts  and swapped for more expensive loan products on the day of closing  whereas the advertisement might state that 1  or 1.5  interest would be charged  the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage  arm  in which the interest charged would be greater than the amount of interest paid  this created negative amortization  which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated 
countrywide  sued by california attorney general jerry brown for  unfair business practices  and  false advertising  was making high cost mortgages  to homeowners with weak credit  adjustable rate mortgages  arms  that allowed homeowners to make interest-only payments   89  when housing prices decreased  homeowners in arms then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments  since their home equity had disappeared  this caused countrywide s financial condition to deteriorate  ultimately resulting in a decision by the office of thrift supervision to seize the lender 
former employees from ameriquest  which was united states  leading wholesale lender  90  described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to wall street banks eager to make fast profits  90  there is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis  90 
deregulation edit 
further information  government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis
a 2012 oecd study 91  suggest that bank regulation based on the basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis  in other cases  laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system  key examples include 
jimmy carter s depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of 1980  didmca  phased out a number of restrictions on banks  financial practices  broadened their lending powers  allowed credit unions and savings and loans to offer checkable deposits  and raised the deposit insurance limit from  40,000 to  100,000  thereby potentially lessening depositor scrutiny of lenders  risk management policies   92 
in october 1982  u s  president ronald reagan signed into law the garnst  germain depository institutions act  which provided for adjustable-rate mortgage loans  began the process of banking deregulation  and contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s early 1990s  93 
in november 1999  u s  president bill clinton signed into law the grammleachbliley act  which repealed provisions of the glass-steagall act that prohibit a bank holding company from owning other financial companies  the repeal effectively removed the separation that previously existed between wall street investment banks and depository banks  most analysts say that this repeal directly contributed to the severity of the financial crisis of 20072010  94  however  there is perspective that repeal made little difference because the institutions that were greatly affected did not fall under the jurisdiction of the act itself  95 
in 2004  the u s  securities and exchange commission relaxed the net capital rule  which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on  fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages  the sec has conceded that self-regulation of investment banks contributed to the crisis  96  97 
financial institutions in the shadow banking system are not subject to the same regulation as depository banks  allowing them to assume additional debt obligations relative to their financial cushion or capital base  98  this was the case despite the long-term capital management debacle in 1998  where a highly leveraged shadow institution failed with systemic implications 
regulators and accounting standard-setters allowed depository banks such as citigroup to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities off-balance sheet into complex legal entities called structured investment vehicles  masking the weakness of the capital base of the firm or degree of leverage or risk taken  one news agency estimated that the top four u s  banks will have to return between  500billion and  1trillion to their balance sheets during 2009  99  this increased uncertainty during the crisis regarding the financial position of the major banks  100  off-balance sheet entities were also used by enron as part of the scandal that brought down that company in 2001  101 
as early as 1997  federal reserve chairman alan greenspan fought to keep the derivatives market unregulated  102  with the advice of the president s working group on financial markets  103  the u s  congress and president bill clinton allowed the self-regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market when they enacted the commodity futures modernization act of 2000  derivatives such as credit default swaps  cds  can be used to hedge or speculate against particular credit risks without necessarily owning the underlying debt instruments  the volume of cds outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008  with estimates of the debt covered by cds contracts  as of november 2008  ranging from us 33 to  47trillion  total over-the-counter  otc  derivative notional value rose to  683trillion by june 2008  104  warren buffett famously referred to derivatives as  financial weapons of mass destruction  in early 2003  105  106 
increased debt burden or overleveraging edit 
leverage ratios of investment banks increased significantly between 2003 and 2007 
prior to the crisis  financial institutions became highly leveraged  increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses  much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives  which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels  12  these instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy  and contributed to the need for government bailouts  12 
household debt relative to disposable income and gdp 
u s  households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or overleveraged during the years preceding the crisis  107  this increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn  108  key statistics include 
free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from  627billion in 2001 to  1,428billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built  a total of nearly  5trillion over the period  contributing to economic growth worldwide  109  110  111  u s  home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46  during the 1990s to 73  during 2008  reaching  10.5trillion  112 
usa household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127  at the end of 2007  versus 77  in 1990  107  in 1981  u s  private debt was 123  of gdp  by the third quarter of 2008  it was 290   113 
from 2004 to 2007  the top five u s  investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage  see diagram   which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock  changes in capital requirements  intended to keep u s  banks competitive with their european counterparts  allowed lower risk weightings for aaa securities  the shift from first-loss tranches to aaa tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage  114  these five institutions reported over  4.1trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007  about 30  of usa nominal gdp for 2007  lehman brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated  bear stearns and merrill lynch were sold at fire-sale prices  and goldman sachs and morgan stanley became commercial banks  subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation  with the exception of lehman  these companies required or received government support  115  lehman reported that it had been in talks with bank of america and barclays for the company s possible sale  however  both barclays and bank of america ultimately declined to purchase the entire company  116 
fannie mae and freddie mac  two u s  government-sponsored enterprises  owned or guaranteed nearly  5trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into conservatorship by the u s  government in september 2008  117  118 
these seven entities were highly leveraged and had  9trillion in debt or guarantee obligations  yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks  98  119 
behavior that may be optimal for an individual  e g   saving more during adverse economic conditions  can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior  as ultimately one person s consumption is another person s income  too many consumers attempting to save  or pay down debt  simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession  economist hyman minsky also described a  paradox of deleveraging  as financial institutions that have too much leverage  debt relative to equity  cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets  108 
during april 2009  u s  federal reserve vice-chair janet yellen discussed these paradoxes   once this massive credit crunch hit  it didnt take long before we were in a recession  the recession  in turn  deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell  and credit losses of financial institutions surged  indeed  we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year  a process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy  consumers are pulling back on purchases  especially on durable goods  to build their savings  businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash  and  financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm  once again  minsky understood this dynamic  he spoke of the paradox of deleveraging  in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firmsand indeed essential to return the economy to a normal statenevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole   108 
financial innovation and complexity edit 
imf diagram of cdo and rmbs
the term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives  such as offsetting a particular risk exposure  such as the default of a borrower  or to assist with obtaining financing  examples pertinent to this crisis included  the adjustable-rate mortgage  the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage-backed securities  mbs  or collateralized debt obligations  cdo  for sale to investors  a type of securitization  and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps  cds   the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis  these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions 
cdo issuance grew from an estimated  20 billion in q1 2004 to its peak of over  180 billion by q1 2007  then declined back under  20 billion by q1 2008  further  the credit quality of cdo s declined from 2000 to 2007  as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5  to 36  of cdo assets  120  as described in the section on subprime lending  the cds and portfolio of cds called synthetic cdo enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding  provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found  for example  buying a cds to insure a cdo ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the cdo  when those cdo s became worthless  121 
diagram of cmlti 2006  nc2
this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity  it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage  including mortgage brokers  specialized originators  the securitizers and their due diligence firms  managing agents and trading desks  and finally investors  insurances and providers of repo funding   with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information  including fico scores on creditworthiness  appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations  and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks   instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts  misjudgments and finally market collapse  122 
martin wolf further wrote in june 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations  such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks  stating      an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade  the off-balance-sheet vehicles  the derivatives and the  shadow banking system  itself  was to find a way round regulation   123 
incorrect pricing of risk edit 
a protester on wall street in the wake of the aig bonus payments controversy is interviewed by news media 
the pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk  which may be measured by interest rates or fees  several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks  risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis  enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have  and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward  readily understandable format  10  12 
for a variety of reasons  market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system  21  for example  the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system  banks estimated that  450bn of cdo were sold between  late 2005 to the middle of 2007   among the  102bn of those that had been liquidated  jpmorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for  high quality  cdos was approximately 32cents on the dollar  while the recovery rate for mezzanine cdo was approximately five cents for every dollar  124 
another example relates to aig  which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps  the basic cds transaction involved aig receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party a in the event party b defaulted  however  aig did not have the financial strength to support its many cds commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in september 2008  u s  taxpayers provided over  180billion in government support to aig during 2008 and early 2009  through which the money flowed to various counterparties to cds transactions  including many large global financial institutions  125  126 
the financial crisis inquiry commission  fcic  made the major government study of the crisis  it concluded in january 2011 
the commission concludes aig failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral  setting aside capital reserves  or hedging its exposure  a profound failure in corporate governance  particularly its risk management practices  aig s failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter  otc  derivatives  including credit default swaps  which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products  including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of aig s failure  127  128  129 
the limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood  130  131  this formula assumed that the price of cds was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage-backed securities  because it was highly tractable  it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of cdo and cds investors  issuers  and rating agencies  131  according to one wired com article 
then the model fell apart  cracks started appearing early on  when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of li s formula hadn t expected  the cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008when ruptures in the financial system s foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril    li s gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees  131 
as financial assets became more and more complex  and harder and harder to value  investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators  who came to rely on them  accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be  132  george soros commented that  the super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves  similarly  the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products  it was a shocking abdication of responsibility   133 
moreover  a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients  combined with a global glut in investment capital  led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets  professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management  there is  therefore  an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation  as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline  asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients  many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced  under-yielding  investments  to the detriment of their clients  in order to maintain their assets under management  this choice was supported by a  plausible deniability  of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early  vintages  of subprime loans was so low  134 
despite the dominance of the above formula  there are documented attempts of the financial industry  occurring before the crisis  to address the formula limitations  specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events  135  the volume  credit correlation  life after copulas   published in 2007 by world scientific  summarizes a 2006 conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations  see also the article by donnelly and embrechts 136  and the book by brigo  pallavicini and torresetti  that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in 2006  137 
mortgage risks were underestimated by every institution in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years  limitations of default and prepayment models  the heart of pricing models  led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators  securitizers  broker-dealers  rating-agencies  insurance underwriters and investors   138  139 
boom and collapse of the shadow banking system edit 
securitization markets were impaired during the crisis
there is strong evidence that the riskiest  worst performing mortgages were funded through the  shadow banking system  and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their own underwriting standards and originate riskier loans  10 
in a june 2008 speech  president and ceo of the new york federal reserve bank timothy geithnerwho in 2009 became secretary of the united states treasuryplaced significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a  run  on the entities in the  parallel  banking system  also called the shadow banking system  these entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system  but were not subject to the same regulatory controls  further  these entities were vulnerable because of maturity mismatch  meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term  illiquid and risky assets  this meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging  selling their long-term assets at depressed prices  he described the significance of these entities 
in early 2007  asset-backed commercial paper conduits  in structured investment vehicles  in auction-rate preferred securities  tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes  had a combined asset size of roughly  2.2trillion  assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to  2.5trillion  assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly  1.8trillion  the combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled  4trillion  in comparison  the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the united states at that point were just over  6trillion  and total assets of the entire banking system were about  10trillion  the combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles  33 
paul krugman  laureate of the nobel prize in economics  described the run on the shadow banking system as the  core of what happened  to cause the crisis  he referred to this lack of controls as  malign neglect  and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity  98 
the securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008  more than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds  140  according to the brookings institution  the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009   it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume   the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are  likely to vanish forever  having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions   141 
commodities boom edit 
main article  2000s commodities boom
rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble  the price of oil nearly tripled from  50 to  147 from early 2007 to 2008  before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008  142  experts debate the causes  with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities  some to monetary policy  143  and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world  leading to long positions taken on those markets  such as chinese increasing presence in africa  an increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline  which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries  as wealth flows to oil-producing states  144  a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified  145  the destabilizing effects of this price variance has been proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis 
global copper prices
copper prices increased at the same time as the oil prices  copper traded at about  2,500 per ton from 1990 until 1999  when it fell to about  1,600  the price slump lasted until 2004 which saw a price surge that had copper reaching  7,040 per ton in 2008  146 
nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s  then the price of nickel declined from around  51,000  36,700 per metric ton in may 2007 to about  11,550 8,300 per metric ton in january 2009  prices were only just starting to recover as of january 2010  but most of australia s nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then  147  as the price for high grade nickel sulphate ore recovered in 2010  so did the australian nickel mining industry  148 
coincidentally with these price fluctuations  long-only commodity index funds became popular  by one estimate investment increased from  90billion in 2006 to  200billion at the end of 2007  while commodity prices increased 71   which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble  149  the empirical research has been mixed  149 
systemic crisis edit 
another analysis  different from the mainstream explanation  is that the financial crisis is merely a symptom of another  deeper crisis  which is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself  150 
ravi batra s theory is that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes  he has also suggested that a  demand gap  related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments  151  152 
john bellamy foster  a political economy analyst and editor of the monthly review  believes that the decrease in gdp growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing market saturation  153 
john c  bogle wrote during 2005 that a series of unresolved challenges face capitalism that have contributed to past financial crises and have not been sufficiently addressed 
corporate america went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long    they failed to  keep an eye on these geniuses  to whom they had entrusted the responsibility of the management of america s great corporations 
echoing the central thesis of james burnham s 1941 seminal book  the managerial revolution  bogle cites particular issues  including  154  155 
that  manager s capitalism  has replaced  owner s capitalism   meaning management runs the firm for its benefit rather than for the shareholders  a variation on the principalagent problem 
the burgeoning executive compensation 
the management of earnings  mainly a focus on share price rather than the creation of genuine value  and
the failure of gatekeepers  including auditors  boards of directors  wall street analysts  and career politicians 
an analysis conducted by mark roeder  a former executive at the swiss-based ubs bank  suggested that large-scale momentum  or the big mo  played a pivotal role  in the 200809 global financial crisis  roeder suggested that  recent technological advances  such as computer-driven trading programs  together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets  has magnified the momentum effect  this has made the financial sector inherently unstable   156 
robert reich has attributed the current economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the united states  particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80  of the workforce  his claim is that this stagnation forced the population to borrow in order to meet the cost of living  157 
feminist economists ailsa mckay and margunn bjrnholt argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession  and call for a reshaping of both the economy  economic theory and the economics profession  they argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics andecological economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible  sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet  158 
role of economic forecasting edit 
the former governor of the reserve bank of india raghuram rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the international monetary fund in 2005  at a celebration honouring alan greenspan  who was about to retire as chairman of the us federal reserve  rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector  159  in that paper   has financial development made the world riskier    rajan  argued that disaster might loom   160  rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to  take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but  in return  offer generous compensation the rest of the time  these risks are known as tail risks  but perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise  financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised  
the financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except raghuram rajan  who instead spoke of the great moderation  a number of heterodox economists predicted the crisis  with varying arguments  dirk bezemer in his research 161  credits  with supporting argument and estimates of timing  12 economists with predicting the crisis  dean baker  us   wynne godley  uk   fred harrison  uk   michael hudson  us   eric janszen  us   steve keen  australia   jakob brchner madsen   jens kjaer srensen  denmark   kurt richebcher  us   nouriel roubini  us   peter schiff  us   and robert shiller  us   examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given  162  163  164  not surprisingly  the austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial  manufactured laxity in monetary supply  165  a perspective that even former fed chair alan greenspan in congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to  166 
a cover story in businessweek magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the great depression of the 1930s  167  the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania s online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis  168  popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis  for example  an article in the new york times informs that economist nouriel roubini warned of such crisis as early as september 2006  and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions  169  according to the guardian  roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession  while the new york times labelled him  dr  doom   170 
shiller  an expert in housing markets  wrote an article a year before the collapse of lehman brothers in which he predicted that a slowing u s  housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst  leading to financial collapse  171  schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse  172 
within mainstream financial economics  most believe that financial crises are simply unpredictable  173  following eugene fama s efficient-market hypothesis and the related random-walk hypothesis  which state respectively that markets contain all information about possible future movements  and that the movements of financial prices are random and unpredictable  recent research casts doubt on the accuracy of  early warning  systems of potential crises  which must also predict their timing  174 
stock trader and financial risk engineer nassim nicholas taleb  author of the 2007 book the black swan  spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of bad risk models and reliance on forecasting  and their reliance on bad models  and framed the problem as part of  robustness and fragility   175  176  he also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis   they didn t listen  so i took their money    177  according to david brooks from the new york times   taleb not only has an explanation for whats happening  he saw it coming   178 
impact on financial markets edit 
u s  stock market edit 
main article  united states bear market of 20072009
the u s  stock market peaked in october 2007  when the dow jones industrial average index exceeded 14,000 points  it then entered a pronounced decline  which accelerated markedly in october 2008  by march 2009  the dow jones average had reached a trough of around 6,600  four years later  it hit an all-time high  it is probable  but debated  that the federal reserve s aggressive policy of quantitative easing spurred the partial recovery in the stock market  179  180  181 
market strategist phil dow believes distinctions exist  between the current market malaise  and the great depression  he says the dow jones average s fall of more than 50  over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7  fall in the great depression  followed by a total drop of 89  over the following 16 months   it s very troubling if you have a mirror image   said dow  182  floyd norris  the chief financial correspondent of the new york times  wrote in a blog entry in march 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the great depression  explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time  the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007  and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the dow  the past two years ranked third  however  183 
financial institutions edit

2007 bank run on northern rock  a uk bank
the first notable event signaling a possible financial crisis occurred in the united kingdom on august 9  2007  when bnp paribas  citing  a complete evaporation of liquidity   blocked withdrawals from three hedge funds  the significance of this event was not immediately recognized but soon led to a panic as investors and savers attempted to liquidate assets deposited in highly leveraged financial institutions  7 
the international monetary fund estimated that large u s  and european banks lost more than  1trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from january 2007 to september 2009  these losses are expected to top  2.8trillion from 2007 to 2010  u s  bank losses were forecast to hit  1trillion and european bank losses will reach  1.6trillion  the international monetary fund  imf  estimated that u s  banks were about 60  through their losses  but british and eurozone banks only 40   184 
one of the first victims was northern rock  a medium-sized british bank  185  the highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the bank of england  this in turn led to investor panic and a bank run 186  in mid-september 2007  calls by liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored  in february 2008  however  the british government  having failed to find a private sector buyer  relented  and the bank was taken into public hands  northern rock s problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions 
indymac edit 
the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern californiabased indymac  a spin-off of countrywide financial  before its failure  indymac bank was the largest savings and loan association in the los angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the united states  187  the failure of indymac bank on july 11  2008  was the fourth largest bank failure in united states history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures  188  and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift  189  indymac bank s parent corporation was indymac bancorp until the fdic seized indymac bank  190  indymac bancorp filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in july 2008  190 
indymac bank was founded as countrywide mortgage investment in 1985 by david s  loeb and angelo mozilo 191  192  as a means of collateralizing countrywide financial loans too big to be sold to freddie mac and fannie mae  in 1997  countrywide spun off indymac as an independent company run by mike perry  who remained its ceo until the downfall of the bank in july 2008  193 
the primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing alt-a loans on a large scale  this strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets  from its inception as a savings association in 2000  indymac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the united states  during 2006  indymac originated over  90 billion of mortgages 
indymacs aggressive growth strategy  use of alt-a and other nontraditional loan products  insufficient underwriting  credit concentrations in residential real estate in the california and florida marketsstates  alongside nevada and arizona  where the housing bubble was most pronouncedand heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a federal home loan bank  fhlb  and from brokered deposits  led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007 
indymac often made loans without verification of the borrowers income or assets  and to borrowers with poor credit histories  appraisals obtained by indymac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well  as an alt-a lender  indymacs business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrowers needs  using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages  option arms   subprime loans  80/20 loans  and other nontraditional products  ultimately  loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments  the thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market  indymac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria  see the comment by ruthann melbourne  chief risk officer  to the regulating agencies  194  195  196 
may 12  2008  in a small note in the  capital  section of its what would become its last 10-q released before receivership  indymac revealed  but did not admit  that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency 
indymac reported that during april 2008  moody s and standard   poor s downgraded the ratings on a significant number of mortgage-backed security  mbs  bonds including  160 million of those issued by indymac and which the bank retained in its mbs portfolio  indymac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the company s risk-based capital ratio as of june 30  2008  had these lowered ratings been in effect at march 31  2008  indymac concluded that the bank s capital ratio would have been 9.27  total risk-based  indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below  well capitalized   minimum 10  risk-based capital ratio  to  adequately capitalized   810  risk-based capital ratio  the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds 
senator charles schumer  d-ny  would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of indymac s total deposits and ask the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  whether it had considered ordering indymac to reduce its reliance on these deposits  197  with  18.9 billion in total deposits reported on march 31  198  senator schumer would have been referring to a little over  7 billion in brokered deposits  while the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly  a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to indymac at  500 million a month  had the regulator disallowed indymac from acquiring new brokered deposits on june 30 
indymac was taking new measures to preserve capital  such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities  dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008  after being cut in half the previous quarter  the company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer  199  200 
indymac reported that the bank s risk-based capital was only  47 million above the minimum required for this 10  mark  but it did not reveal some of that  47 million capital it claimed it had  as of march 31  2008  was fabricated

when home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed  indymac was forced to hold  10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market  its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late june 2008 when account holders withdrew  1.55 billion or about 7.5  of indymac s deposits  201  this run on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from senator charles schumer to the fdic and ots  the letter outlined the senators concerns with indymac  while the run was a contributing factor in the timing of indymacs demise  the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated  194 
on june 26  2008  senator charles schumer  d-ny   a member of the senate banking committee  chairman of congress  joint economic committee and the third-ranking democrat in the senate  202  released several letters he had sent to regulators  which warned that  the possible collapse of big mortgage lender indymac bancorp inc  poses significant financial risks to its borrowers and depositors  and regulators may not be ready to intervene to protect them   some worried depositors began to withdraw money  203 
on july 7  2008  indymac announced on the company blog that it 
had failed to raise capital since its may 12  2008 quarterly earnings report 
had been notified by bank and thrift regulators that indymac bank was no longer deemed  well-capitalized  
indymac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions  halted new loan submissions  and cut 3,800 jobs  204 
on july 11  2008  citing liquidity concerns  the fdic put indymac bank into conservatorship  a bridge bank  indymac federal bank  fsb  was established to assume control of indymac bank s assets  its secured liabilities  and its insured deposit accounts  the fdic announced plans to open indymac federal bank  fsb on july 14  2008  until then  depositors would have access their insured deposits through atms  their existing checks  and their existing debit cards  telephone and internet account access was restored when the bank reopened  205  206  207  the fdic guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to us 100,000  and has declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount  guaranteeing 50  of any amounts in excess of  100,000  189  yet  even with the pending sale of indymac to imb management holdings  an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of indymac are still at a loss of over  270 million  208  209

indymac bancorp filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy on july 31  2008  190 
initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as northern rock and countrywide financial  as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets  over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008  concerns that investment bank bear stearns would collapse in march 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to jp morgan chase  the financial institution crisis hit its peak in september and october 2008  several major institutions either failed  were acquired under duress  or were subject to government takeover  these included lehman brothers  merrill lynch  fannie mae  freddie mac  washington mutual  wachovia  citigroup  and aig  210  on oct  6  2008  three weeks after lehman brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in u s  history  lehman s former ceo found himself before representative henry a  waxman  the california democrat who chaired the house committee on oversight and government reform  fuld said he was a victim of the collapse  blaming a  crisis of confidence  in the markets for dooming his firm  211 
credit markets and the shadow banking system edit 
ted spread and components during 2008
in september 2008  the crisis hit its most critical stage  there was the equivalent of a bank run on the money market funds  which frequently invest in commercial paper issued by corporations to fund their operations and payrolls  withdrawal from money markets were  144.5billion during one week  versus  7.1billion the week prior  this interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover  replace  their short-term debt  the u s  government responded by extending insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee 212  and with federal reserve programs to purchase commercial paper  the ted spread  an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy  spiked up in july 2007  remained volatile for a year  then spiked even higher in september 2008  213  reaching a record 4.65  on october 10  2008 
in a dramatic meeting on september 18  2008  treasury secretary henry paulson and fed chairman ben bernanke met with key legislators to propose a  700billion emergency bailout  bernanke reportedly told them   if we don t do this  we may not have an economy on monday   214  the emergency economic stabilization act  which implemented the troubled asset relief program  tarp   was signed into law on october 3  2008  215 
economist paul krugman and u s  treasury secretary timothy geithner explain the credit crisis via the implosion of the shadow banking system  which had grown to nearly equal the importance of the traditional commercial banking sector as described above  without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgage-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper  investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations  33  98 
this meant that nearly one-third of the u s  lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into june 2009  140  according to the brookings institution  the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009   it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume   the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are  likely to vanish forever  having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions   while traditional banks have raised their lending standards  it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that is the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing  216 
wealth effects edit 
the new york city headquarters of lehman brothers
there is a direct relationship between declines in wealth and declines in consumption and business investment  which along with government spending  represent the economic engine  between june 2007 and november 2008  americans lost an estimated average of more than a quarter of their collective net worth  citation needed  by early november 2008  a broad u s  stock index the s p 500  was down 45  from its 2007 high  housing prices had dropped 20  from their 2006 peak  with futures markets signaling a 3035  potential drop  total home equity in the united states  which was valued at  13trillion at its peak in 2006  had dropped to  8.8trillion by mid-2008 and was still falling in late 2008  total retirement assets  americans  second-largest household asset  dropped by 22   from  10.3trillion in 2006 to  8trillion in mid-2008  during the same period  savings and investment assets  apart from retirement savings  lost  1.2trillion and pension assets lost  1.3trillion  taken together  these losses total a staggering  8.3trillion  210  since peaking in the second quarter of 2007  household wealth is down 14trillion  217 
further  u s  homeowners had extracted significant equity in their homes in the years leading up to the crisis  which they could no longer do once housing prices collapsed  free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from  627billion in 2001 to  1,428billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built  a total of nearly  5trillion over the period  109  110  111  u s  home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46  during the 1990s to 73  during 2008  reaching  10.5trillion  112 
to offset this decline in consumption and lending capacity  the u s  government and u s  federal reserve have committed  13.9trillion  of which  6.8trillion has been invested or spent  as of june 2009  218  in effect  the fed has gone from being the  lender of last resort  to the  lender of only resort  for a significant portion of the economy  in some cases the fed can now be considered the  buyer of last resort  
in november 2008  economist dean baker observed   there is a really good reason for tighter credit  tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today  businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression  this matters for credit decisions  a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt  they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and or have a default placed on their credit record  on the other hand  a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk  in the case of businesses  their creditworthiness depends on their future profits  profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007    while many banks are obviously at the brink  consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid  the problem with the economy is the loss of close to  6trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth  219 
at the heart of the portfolios of many of these institutions were investments whose assets had been derived from bundled home mortgages  exposure to these mortgage-backed securities  or to the credit derivatives used to insure them against failure  caused the collapse or takeover of several key firms such as lehman brothers  aig  merrill lynch  and hbos  220  221  222 
european contagion edit 
the crisis rapidly developed and spread into a global economic shock  resulting in a number of european bank failures  declines in various stock indexes  and large reductions in the market value of equities 223  and commodities  224 
both mbs and cdo were purchased by corporate and institutional investors globally  derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions  moreover  the de-leveraging of financial institutions  as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets  further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade 
world political leaders  national ministers of finance and central bank directors coordinated their efforts to reduce fears  but the crisis continued  225  at the end of october 2008 a currency crisis developed  with investors transferring vast capital resources into stronger currencies such as the yen  the dollar and the swiss franc  leading many emergent economies to seek aid from the international monetary fund  226  227 
effects on the global economy  as of 2009  edit 
main article  great recession
global effects edit 
several commentators have suggested that if the liquidity crisis continues  an extended recession or worse could occur  228  the continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative  229  the financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking shakeout since the savings-and-loan meltdown  230  investment bank ubs stated on october 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession  with recovery unlikely for at least two years  231  three days later ubs economists announced that the  beginning of the end  of the crisis had begun  with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis  capital injection by governments  injection made systemically  interest rate cuts to help borrowers  the united kingdom had started systemic injection  and the world s central banks were now cutting interest rates  ubs emphasized the united states needed to implement systemic injection  ubs further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis  but that in economic terms  the worst is still to come   232  ubs quantified their expected recession durations on october 16  the eurozone s would last two quarters  the united states  would last three quarters  and the united kingdom s would last four quarters  233  the economic crisis in iceland involved all three of the country s major banks  relative to the size of its economy  icelands banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history  234 
at the end of october ubs revised its outlook downwards  the forthcoming recession would be the worst since the early 1980s recession with negative 2009 growth for the u s   eurozone  uk  very limited recovery in 2010  but not as bad as the great depression  235 
the brookings institution reported in june 2009 that u s  consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007   the us economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the u s  consumer as a source of global demand   with a recession in the u s  and the increased savings rate of u s  consumers  declines in growth elsewhere have been dramatic  for the first quarter of 2009  the annualized rate of decline in gdp was 14.4  in germany  15.2  in japan  7.4  in the uk  18  in latvia  236  9.8  in the euro area and 21.5  for mexico  237 
some developing countries that had seen strong economic growth saw significant slowdowns  for example  growth forecasts in cambodia show a fall from more than 10  in 2007 to close to zero in 2009  and kenya may achieve only 34  growth in 2009  down from 7  in 2007  according to the research by the overseas development institute  reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade  commodity prices  investment and remittances sent from migrant workers  which reached a record  251billion in 2007  but have fallen in many countries since   238  this has stark implications and has led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line  be it 300,000 in bangladesh or 230,000 in ghana  238  especially states with a fragile political system have to fear that investors from western states withdraw their money because of the crisis  bruno wenn of the german deg recommends to provide a sound economic policymaking and good governance to attract new investors 239 
the world bank reported in february 2009 that the arab world was far less severely affected by the credit crunch  with generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits  such as remittances  foreign direct investment  fdi  or foreign aid  arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008  this group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks  they entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions  this gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn  the greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices  which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance  steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments  significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks  initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers  240 
u s  economic effects edit 
real gross domestic product edit 
the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the united statesdecreased at an annual rate of approximately 6  in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009  versus activity in the year-ago periods  241  the u s  unemployment rate increased to 10.1  by october 2009  the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate  the average hours per work week declined to 33  the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964  242  243  with the decline of gross domestic product came the decline in innovation  with fewer resources to risk in creative destruction  the number of patent applications flat-lined  compared to the previous 5 years of exponential increases in patent application  this stagnation correlates to the similar drop in gdp during the same time period  244 
distribution of wealth in the us edit 
u s  inequality from 1913 to 2008 
typical american families did not fare as well  nor did those  wealthy-but-not wealthiest  families just beneath the pyramid s top  on the other hand  half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis  the federal reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009  and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all americans declined in that period  77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth  while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease  245  246  247 
official economic projections edit 
on november 3  2008  the european commission at brussels predicted for 2009 an extremely weak growth of gdp  by 0.1   for the countries of the eurozone  france  germany  italy  belgium etc   and even negative number for the uk  1.0    ireland and spain  on november 6  the imf at washington  d c   launched numbers predicting a worldwide recession by 0.3  for 2009  averaged over the developed economies  on the same day  the bank of england and the european central bank  respectively  reduced their interest rates from 4.5  down to 3   and from 3.75  down to 3.25   as a consequence  starting from november 2008  several countries launched large  help packages  for their economies 
the u s  federal reserve open market committee release in june 2009 stated 
   the pace of economic contraction is slowing  conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months  household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses  lower housing wealth  and tight credit  businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales  although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time  the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions  fiscal and monetary stimulus  and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability  248  economic projections from the federal reserve and reserve bank presidents include a return to typical growth levels  gdp  of 2.53  in 2010  an unemployment plateau in 2009 and 2010 around 10  with moderation in 2011  and inflation that remains at typical levels around 12   249 
government responses edit 
emergency and short-term responses edit 
main article  subprime mortgage crisis responses
the u s  federal reserve and central banks around the world took steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral  in which lower wages and higher unemployment lead to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption  in addition  governments enacted large fiscal stimulus packages  by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis  the u s  federal reserve s new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma  broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity  and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity  250 
this credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse  the response of the federal reserve  the european central bank  the bank of england and other central banks was immediate and dramatic  during the last quarter of 2008  these central banks purchased us 2.5trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks  this was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market  and the largest monetary policy action  in world history  following a model initiated by the united kingdom bank rescue package  251  252  the governments of european nations and the usa guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems  ultimately purchasing  1.5trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks  210  in october 2010  nobel laureate joseph stiglitz explained how the u s  federal reserve was implementing another monetary policy creating currency as a method to combat the liquidity trap  253  by creating  600 billion and inserting clarification needed  this directly into banks  the federal reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages  however  banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets  banks were also investing in foreign currencies  which stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while china redirects its currency holdings away from the united states  254 
governments have also bailed out a variety of firms as discussed above  incurring large financial obligations  to date  various u s  government agencies have committed or spent trillions of dollars in loans  asset purchases  guarantees  and direct spending  255  significant controversy has accompanied the bailout  leading to the development of a variety of  decision making frameworks   to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis  256 
the u s  executed two stimulus packages  totaling nearly  1trillion during 2008 and 2009  257  other countries also implemented fiscal stimulus plans beginning in 2008 
regulatory proposals and long-term responses edit 
further information  obama financial regulatory reform plan of 2009  regulatory responses to the subprime crisis  and subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate
united states president barack obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in june 2009  the proposals address consumer protection  executive pay  bank financial cushions or capital requirements  expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives  and enhanced authority for the federal reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions  among others  258  259  260  in january 2010  obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading  the proposals were dubbed  the volcker rule   in recognition of paul volcker  who has publicly argued for the proposed changes  261  262 
the u s  senate passed a reform bill in may 2010  following the house which passed a bill in december 2009  these bills must now be reconciled  the new york times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills  which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the obama administration  263  for instance  the volcker rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation  though in the senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades 
european regulators introduced basel iii regulations for banks  264  it increased capital ratios  limits on leverage  narrow definition of capital  to exclude subordinated debt   limit counter-party risk  and new liquidity requirements  265  critics argue that basel iii doesnt address the problem of faulty risk-weightings  major banks suffered losses from aaa-rated created by financial engineering  which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral  that required less capital according to basel ii  lending to aa-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero  thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis  266  johan norberg argues that regulations  basel iii among others  have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments  see european sovereign-debt crisis  and the ecb pursues even more lending as the solution  267 
united states congress response edit 
at least two major reports were produced by congress  the financial crisis inquiry commission report  released january 2011  and a report by the united states senate homeland security permanent subcommittee on investigations entitled wall street and the financial crisis  anatomy of a financial collapse  released april 2011

stabilization edit 
the u s  recession that began in december 2007 ended in june 2009  according to the u s  national bureau of economic research  nber  274  and the financial crisis appears to have ended about the same time  in april 2009 time magazine declared  more quickly than it began  the banking crisis is over   275  the united states financial crisis inquiry commission dates the crisis to 2008  276  277  president barack obama declared on january 27  2010   the markets are now stabilized  and we ve recovered most of the money we spent on the banks   278 
the new york times identifies march 2009 as the  nadir of the crisis  and notes that  most stock markets around the world are at least 75 percent higher than they were then  financial stocks  which led the markets down  have also led them up   nevertheless  the lack of fundamental changes in banking and financial markets  worries many market participants  including the international monetary fund  279 
the distribution of household incomes in the united states has become more unequal during the post-2008 economic recovery  a first for the us but in line with the trend over the last ten economic recoveries since 1949  280  281  income inequality in the united states has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas  282  median household wealth fell 35  in the us  from  106,591 to  68,839 between 2005 and 2011  283

michael lewis published a best-selling non-fiction book about the crisis  entitled the big short  in 2015  it was adapted into a film of the same name  which won the academy award for best adapted screenplay  one point raised is to what extent those outside of the markets themselves  i e   not working for a mainstream investment bank  could forecast the events and be generally less myopic  subsequent to the crisis itself some observers furthermore noted a change in social relations as some group culpability emerged  286 
emerging and developing economies drive global economic growth edit 
advanced economies led global economic growth prior to the financial crisis with  emerging  and  developing  economies lagging behind  the crisis completely overturned this relationship  the international monetary fund found that  advanced  economies accounted for only 31  of global gdp while emerging and developing economies accounted for 69  of global gdp from 2007 to 2014  287  in the tables  the names of emergent economies are shown in boldface type  while the names of developed economies are in roman  regular  type
