mission edit 
the centers mission is to perform plant science research in genetics  breeding and horticulture  and further develop technologies to allow for the economic commercialization and sustainability of energy farms  the center provides a common research platform to foster communication and cooperation among various national and international research institutions and organizations in the biofuel sector  from a global economics  environmental and social perspective  this collaboration will contribute to the development of more productive energy farms capable of supplying large quantities of plant-based  non-food  oils to replace the use of fossil fuels  this initiative has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs in the agri-business and alternative energy industries  expand the use of non-productive land  generate local business-to-business opportunities  reduce global dependency on oil reserves  and contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions  1 
current research edit 
the center is focused on developing high-yielding commercial varieties of jatropha curcas through interdisciplinary research cooperation across multiple scientific disciplines  2  the center has a goal of improving yields 300 percent and reducing inputs by 30 percent within 10 years
