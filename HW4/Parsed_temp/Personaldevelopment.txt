aristotle and the western tradition edit 
the greek philosopher aristotle  384 bce  322 bce  influenced theories which   of personal development in the west  in his nicomachean ethics  aristotle defined personal development as a category of phronesis or practical wisdom  where the practice of virtues  arte  leads to eudaimonia  9  commonly translated as  happiness  but more accurately understood as  human flourishing  or  living well   10  aristotle continues to influence the western concept of personal development to this day update   particularly in the economics of human development 11  and in positive psychology  12 
confucius and the east asian tradition edit 
in chinese tradition  confucius  around 551 bce  479 bce  founded an ongoing philosophy  his ideas continue to influence family values  education and management in china and east asia  in his great learning confucius wrote 
the ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom  first ordered well their own states  wishing to order well their states  they first regulated their families  wishing to regulate their families  they first cultivated their persons  wishing to cultivate their persons  they first rectified their hearts  wishing to rectify their hearts  they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts  wishing to be sincere in their thoughts  they first extended to the utmost their knowledge  such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things  13 
contexts edit 
psychology edit 
psychology became linked to personal development starting when   with alfred adler  18701937  and carl jung  18751961  
adler refused to limit psychology to analysis  making the important point that aspirations look forward and do not limit themselves to unconscious drives or to childhood experiences  14  he also originated the concepts of lifestyle  1929he defined  lifestyle  as an individual s characteristic approach to life  in facing problems  and of self image  citation needed  a concept that influenced management under the heading of work-life balance  clarification needed 
carl gustav jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of individuation  which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the self  15 
daniel levinson  19201994  developed jung s early concept of  life stages  and included a sociological perspective  levinson proposed that personal development come under the influencethroughout lifeof aspirations  which he called  the dream  
whatever the nature of his dream  a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out  it makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the dream  or opposed to it  if the dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die  and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose  16 
levinson s model of seven life-stages has been considerably modified by whom   due to sociological changes which   in the lifecycle  17 
research on success in reaching goals  as undertaken by albert bandura  born 1925   suggested that self-efficacy 18  best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results  according to bandura self-confidence functions as a powerful predictor of success because  19 
it makes you expect to succeed
it allows you take risks and set challenging goals
it helps you keep trying if at first you don t succeed
it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough
in 1998 martin seligman won election to a one-year term as president of the american psychological association and proposed a new focus  on healthy individuals citation needed  rather than on pathology  he created the  positive psychology  current 
we have discovered that there is a set of human strengths that are the most likely buffers against mental illness  courage  optimism  interpersonal skill  work ethic  hope  honesty and perseverance  much of the task of prevention will be to create a science of human strength whose mission will be to foster these virtues in young people  20 
higher education edit 
personal development has been at the heart of education in the west citation needed  in the form of the greek philosophers  which   and in the east citation needed  with confucius  some people which   emphasize personal development as a part of higher education  wilhelm von humboldt  who founded the university of berlin  since 1949  humboldt university of berlin  in 1810  made a statement interpretable by whom   as referring to personal development   if there is one thing more than another which absolutely requires free activity on the part of the individual  it is precisely education  whose object it is to develop the individual  21 
during the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on american campuses 22  led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students  arthur chickering defined seven vectors of personal development 23  for young adults during their undergraduate years 
developing competence
managing emotions
achieving autonomy and interdependence
developing mature interpersonal relationships
establishing identity
developing purpose
developing integrity
in the uk  personal development took a central place in university policy citation needed  in 1997 when the dearing report 24  declared that universities should go beyond academic teaching to provide students with personal development  citation needed  in 2001 a quality assessment agency for uk universities produced guidelines 25  for universities to enhance personal development as 
  a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning  performance and   or achievement and to plan for their personal  educational and career development 
  objectives related explicitly to student development  to improve the capacity of students to understand what and how they are learning  and to review  plan and take responsibility for their own learning
in the 1990s  business schools began to set up specific personal-development programs for leadership and career orientation and in 1998 the european foundation for management development set up the equis accreditation system which specified that personal development must form part of the learning process through internships  working on team projects and going abroad for work or exchange programs  citation needed 
the first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a partnership between metizo  26  a personal-development consulting firm  and the euromed management school 27  in marseilles  students must not only complete assignments but also demonstrate self-awareness and achievement of personal-development competencies 
as an academic department personal development has become when   a specific discipline  usually associated with business schools  28  as an area of research  personal development draws on links to other academic disciplines 
education for questions of learning and assessment
psychology for motivation and personality
sociology for identity and social networks
economics for human capital and economic value
philosophy for ethics and self-reflection
the workplace edit 
abraham maslow  19081970   proposed a hierarchy of needs with self actualization at the top  defined as  29 
 the desire to become more and more what one is  to become everything that one is capable of becoming 
since maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people self-actualizehe estimated one percent 30 his hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard self-actualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid  while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employees  citation needed 
as organizations and labor markets became more global  responsibility for development shifted from the company to the individual  clarification needed  in 1999 management thinker peter drucker wrote in the harvard business review 
we live in an age of unprecedented opportunity  if you ve got ambition and smarts  you can rise to the top of your chosen profession  regardless of where you started out  but with opportunity comes responsibility  companies today aren t managing their employees  careers  knowledge workers must  effectively  be their own chief executive officers  it s up to you to carve out your place  to know when to change course  and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years  31 
management professors sumantra ghoshal of the london business school and christopher bartlett of the harvard business school wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract  32  on the one hand the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value   market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative  creativity and skills of all employees  
on the other hand  employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and      embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development  
the 1997 publication of ghoshal s and bartlett s individualized corporation corresponded to a change in career development from a system of predefined paths defined by companies  to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilities  citation needed  another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that women s careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men  the 2007 study of women s careers by sylvia ann hewlett off-ramps and on-ramps 33  had a major impact on the way companies view careers  citation needed  further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by herminia ibarra in her working identity on the relationship with career change and identity change  34  indicating that priorities of work and lifestyle continually develop through life 
personal development programs in companies fall into two categories  the provision of employee benefits and the fostering of development strategies 
employee benefits have the purpose of improving satisfaction  motivation and loyalty  citation needed  employee surveys may help organizations find out personal-development needs  preferences and problems  and they use the results to design benefits programs  citation needed  typical programs in this category include 
work-life balance
time management
stress management
health programs
counseling
many such programs resemble programs that some employees might conceivably pay for themselves outside work  yoga  sports  martial arts  money-management  positive psychology  nlp  etc  citation needed 
as an investment  personal development programs have the goal of increasing human capital or improving productivity  innovation or quality  proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organization s strategic development goals  employees gain access to these investment-oriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee  usually defined in a talent management architecture including populations such as new hires  perceived high-potential employees  perceived key employees  sales staff  research staff and perceived future leaders  citation needed  organizations may also offer other  non-investment-oriented  programs to many or even all employees  typical programs which   focus on career-development  personal effectiveness  teamwork  and competency-development  personal development also forms an element in management tools such as personal development planning  assessing one s level of ability using a competency grid  or getting feedback from a 360 questionnaire filled in by colleagues at different levels in the organization 
criticism edit 
scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect  in 2005  steve salerno portrayed the american self-help movementhe uses the acronym sham  the self-help and actualization movementnot only as ineffective in achieving its goals  but also as socially harmful   salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back whether the program worked for them or not   citation needed  others similarly point out that with self-help books  supply increases the demand   the more people read them  the more they think they need them   more like an addiction than an alliance   citation needed  self-help writers have been described as working  in the area of the ideological  the imagined  the narrativized    although a veneer of scientism permeates the ir  work  there is also an underlying armature of moralizing   35
