renewable energy in portugal was the source for 25.7  of energy consumption in 2013   1  in 2014  63  of portugal s electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources   2  in 2015  50.4  of power produced in portugal came from renewable sources  the decrease from the year before was caused by lower productivity in the hydroelectric sector because of a dry year  3 
in 2001  the portuguese government launched a new energy policy instrument  the e4 programme  energy efficiency and endogenous energies   consisting of a set of multiple  diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent  integrated approach to energy supply and demand  by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy  endogenous  sources  the programme sought to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the countrys social fabric  while preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions  especially the carbon dioxide  4 
while from 2002-2007 the main priorities were focused on the introduction of natural gas  aiming at progressively replacing oil and coal in the energy balance  and liberalization of the energy market  by opening this former state-owned sector to competition and private investment   the emphasis shifted for the next 5 years was on energy efficiency  supply and demand sides  and use of endogenous  renewable  energy  4 
during february 2016  an equivalent to 95  of electricity consumed in portugal was produced by renewable sources such as biomass  hydropower  wind power and solar power  a total of 4139 gwh was produced by these sources  5  in may 2016  all of portugal s electricity was produced renewably for a period of over four days  a landmark achievement for a modern european country  6

hydro power edit 
alto lindoso dam  serving the largest hydroelectric power station in the country
the largest hydroelectric power station is at the alto lindoso dam  with a capacity of 630 mw  portugal has about 100 small hydro systems  with a capacity of 256 mw  which produce 815 gwh year  7 
wind power edit 
main article  wind power in portugal
from march 2007 to december 2010  wind power nameplate capacity grew from 1,874 to 3,937 mw in  excluding madeira and azores  portugal  the major wind turbine manufacturers in the portuguese market are enercon  vestas and gamesa  8 
the 240 mw alto minho wind farm in the viana do castelo district became fully operational in november  2008  9  at the time of completion it was europe s largest on-shore wind farm  10 
other major wind farms which are operating  or under construction  include  arada-montemuro wind farm  112 mw   gardunha wind farm  106 mw   pinhal interior wind farm  144 mw  and ventominho wind farm  240 mw  
portugal combines wind and hydropower by using nighttime winds to pump water uphill and sending the water back through generators to produce power the next day  the so-called pumped-storage hydroelectricity  11 
solar power edit 
serpa solar power plant
main article  solar power in portugal
a large photovoltaic power project  the serpa solar power plant  was completed in portugal  one of europe s sunniest areas  12  the 11 megawatt plant covered 150 acres  0.61km2  and employs 52,000 pv panels  the panels are raised 2 metres off the ground allowing grazing to continue  the plant provides enough energy for 8,000 homes and saves an estimated 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year  13  14 
not far from there  moura photovoltaic power station is under construction  with more than 376,000 solar modules  it will have an installed capacity of 62mwp when finished  the first stage of construction is scheduled for completion in 2008  a solar panel factory is also being built in the city of moura  where there are plans to build a research lab  citation needed 
geothermal power edit 
main article  geothermal power in portugal
portugal s main investment for the use of this type of energy is in the azores  small scale use of this energy source began in the 1980s in chaves and s  pedro do sul  continental portugal providing 3 mwt 
in the azores the use of geothermal energy is widespread  with production in 8 of the 9 islands  collectively producing some 235.5 mwt  in 2003  25  of the electricity consumed in so miguel was produced by geothermal energy  1 
wave power edit
