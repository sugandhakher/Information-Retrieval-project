solar energy is radiant light and heat from the sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating  photovoltaics  solar thermal energy  solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis  1  2 
it is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power  active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems  concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy  passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun  selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties  and designing spaces that naturally circulate air 
the large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity  the united nations development programme in its 2000 world energy assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,57549,837 exajoules  ej   this is several times larger than the total world energy consumption  which was 559.8ej in 2012  3  4 
in 2011  the international energy agency said that  the development of affordable  inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits  it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous  inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource  enhance sustainability  reduce pollution  lower the costs of mitigating global warming  and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise  these advantages are global  hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments  they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared   1

further information  solar radiation
about half the incoming solar energy reaches the earth s surface 
average insolation  the theoretical area of the small black dots is sufficient to supply the world s total energy needs of 18 tw with solar power 
the earth receives 174,000terawatts  tw  of incoming solar radiation  insolation  at the upper atmosphere  5  approximately 30  is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds  oceans and land masses  the spectrum of solar light at the earth s surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet  6  most of the world s population live in areas with insolation levels of 150-300 watts m  or 3.5-7.0 kwh m per day 
solar radiation is absorbed by the earth s land surface  oceans  which cover about 71  of the globe  and atmosphere  warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises  causing atmospheric circulation or convection  when the air reaches a high altitude  where the temperature is low  water vapor condenses into clouds  which rain onto the earth s surface  completing the water cycle  the latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection  producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind  cyclones and anti-cyclones  7  sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14c  8  by photosynthesis  green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy  which produces food  wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived  9 
the total solar energy absorbed by earth s atmosphere  oceans and land masses is approximately 3,850,000exajoules  ej  per year  10  in 2002  this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year  11  12  photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000ej per year in biomass  13  the amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the earth s non-renewable resources of coal  oil  natural gas  and mined uranium combined  14

the potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography  time variation  cloud cover  and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire 
geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation  however  the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator  4  time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the earth for solar panels to absorb  this limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day  cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells 
in addition  land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels  roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells  as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way  other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established  4 
solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture  convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world  mostly depending on distance from the equator  although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends  all renewable energies  other than geothermal power and tidal power  derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the sun 
active solar techniques use photovoltaics  concentrated solar power  solar thermal collectors  pumps  and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs  passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties  designing spaces that naturally circulate air  and referencing the position of a building to the sun  active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies  while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies  19 
in 2000  the united nations development programme  un department of economic and social affairs  and world energy council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation  cloud cover  and the land that is usable by humans  the estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,57549,837ej per year  see table below   4

early commercial adaptation
1917 patent drawing of shuman s solar collector
in 1897  frank shuman  a u s  inventor  engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether  which has a lower boiling point than water  and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine  in 1908 shuman formed the sun power company with the intent of building larger solar power plants  he  along with his technical advisor a s e  ackermann and british physicist sir charles vernon boys  21  developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes  increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether  shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water  enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 
shuman built the worlds first solar thermal power station in maadi  egypt  between 1912 and 1913  his plant used parabolic troughs to power a 4552 kilowatts  6070hp  engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres  4,800impgal  5,800usgal  of water per minute from the nile river to adjacent cotton fields  although the outbreak of world war i and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy  shumans vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy  22  in 1916 shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy s utilization  saying 
we have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun

solar water heaters facing the sun to maximize gain
solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water  in low geographical latitudes  below 40degrees  from 60 to 70  of the domestic hot water use with temperatures up to 60c can be provided by solar heating systems  24  the most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors  44   and glazed flat plate collectors  34   generally used for domestic hot water  and unglazed plastic collectors  21   used mainly to heat swimming pools  25 
as of 2007  the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately 154 thermal gigawatt  gwth   26  china is the world leader in their deployment with 70gwth installed as of 2006 and a long-term goal of 210gwth by 2020  27  israel and cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90  of homes using them  28  in the united states  canada  and australia  heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18gwth as of 2005  19 
heating  cooling and ventilation
main articles  solar heating  thermal mass  solar chimney  and solar air conditioning
in the united states  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  hvac  systems account for 30   4.65ej yr  of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50   10.1ej yr  of the energy used in residential buildings  29  30  solar heating  cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy 
mit s solar house  1  built in 1939 in the u s   used seasonal thermal energy storage for year-round heating 
thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heatheat from the sun in the case of solar energy  common thermal mass materials include stone  cement and water  historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night  however  they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well  the size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate  daylighting and shading conditions  when properly incorporated  thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment  31 
a solar chimney  or thermal chimney  in this context  is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building  as the chimney warms  the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building  performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials 32  in a way that mimics greenhouses 
deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling  when planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere  their leaves provide shade during the summer  while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter  33  since bare  leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation  there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating  34  in climates with significant heating loads  deciduous trees should not be planted on the equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability  they can  however  be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain  35 
cooking
main article  solar cooker
parabolic dish produces steam for cooking  in auroville  india
solar cookers use sunlight for cooking  drying and pasteurization  they can be grouped into three broad categories  box cookers  panel cookers and reflector cookers  36  the simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by horace de saussure in 1767  37  a basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid  it can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90150c  194302f   38  panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers  reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries  dish  trough  fresnel mirrors  to focus light on a cooking container  these cookers reach temperatures of 315c  599f  and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the sun  39 
process heat
main articles  solar pond  salt evaporation pond  and solar furnace
solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish  trough and scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications  the first commercial system was the solar total energy project  step  in shenandoah  georgia  usa where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50  of the process heating  air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory  this grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400kw of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401kw steam and 468kw chilled water  and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage  40  evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation  the use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy  modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams  41  clothes lines  clotheshorses  and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas  in some states of the united states legislation protects the  right to dry  clothes  42  unglazed transpired collectors  utc  are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air  utcs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22c  40f  and deliver outlet temperatures of 4560c  113140f   43  the short payback period of transpired collectors  3 to 12years  makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems  43  as of 2003  over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres  380,000sqft  had been installed worldwide  including an 860m2  9,300sqft  collector in costa rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300m2  14,000sqft  collector in coimbatore  india  used for drying marigolds  44

solar water disinfection in indonesia
solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable  the first recorded instance of this was by 16th-century arab alchemists  45  a large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the chilean mining town of las salinas  46  the plant  which had solar collection area of 4,700m2  51,000sqft   could produce up to 22,700l  5,000impgal  6,000usgal  per day and operate for 40years  46  individual still designs include single-slope  double-slope  or greenhouse type   vertical  conical  inverted absorber  multi-wick  and multiple effect  these stills can operate in passive  active  or hybrid modes  double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes  while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications  45 
solar water disinfection  sodis  involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate  pet  bottles to sunlight for several hours  47  exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions  48  it is recommended by the world health organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage  49  over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water  48 
solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity  a further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis  although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable  50  51 
electricity production
main article  solar power
some of the world s largest solar power stations  ivanpah  csp  and topaz  pv 
solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity  either directly using photovoltaics  pv   or indirectly using concentrated solar power  csp   csp systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  pv converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect 
solar power is anticipated to become the world s largest source of electricity by 2050  with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption  respectively  52 
commercial csp plants were first developed in the 1980s  since 1985 the eventually 354 mw segs csp installation  in the mojave desert of california  is the largest solar power plant in the world  other large csp plants include the 150 mw solnova solar power station and the 100 mw andasol solar power station  both in spain  the 250 mw agua caliente solar project  in the united states  and the 221 mw charanka solar park in india  are the worlds largest photovoltaic plants  solar projects exceeding 1 gw are being developed  but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kw  which are connected to the grid using net metering and or a feed-in tariff  53  in 2013 solar generated less than 1  of the world s total grid electricity  54

worldwide growth of pv capacity grouped by region in mw  20062014 
in the last two decades  photovoltaics  pv   also known as solar pv  has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source  a solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect  the first solar cell was constructed by charles fritts in the 1880s  55  in 1931 a german engineer  dr bruno lange  developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide  56  although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1  of incident light into electricity  both ernst werner von siemens and james clerk maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery  57  following the work of russell ohl in the 1940s  researchers gerald pearson  calvin fuller and daryl chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954  58  these early solar cells cost 286usd watt and reached efficiencies of 4.56   59  by 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20   and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40   60 
concentrated solar power
see also  concentrated solar power
concentrating solar power  csp  systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  the concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant  a wide range of concentrating technologies exists  the most developed are the parabolic trough  the concentrating linear fresnel reflector  the stirling dish and the solar power tower  various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light  in all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight  and is then used for power generation or energy storage  61 
architecture and urban planning
main articles  passive solar building design and urban heat island
darmstadt university of technology  germany  won the 2007 solar decathlon in washington  d c  with this passive house designed for humid and hot subtropical climate  62 
sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history  63  advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the greeks and chinese  who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth  64 
the common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the sun  compact proportion  a low surface area to volume ratio   selective shading  overhangs  and thermal mass  63  when these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range  socrates  megaron house is a classic example of passive solar design  63  the most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting  heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package  65  active solar equipment such as pumps  fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance 
urban heat islands  uhi  are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment  the higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete  which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment  a straightforward method of counteracting the uhi effect is to paint buildings and roads white  and to plant trees in the area  using these methods  a hypothetical  cool communities  program in los angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3c at an estimated cost of us 1billion  giving estimated total annual benefits of us 530million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings  66 
agriculture and horticulture
greenhouses like these in the westland municipality of the netherlands grow vegetables  fruits and flowers 
agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants  techniques such as timed planting cycles  tailored row orientation  staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields  67  68  while sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource  the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture  during the short growing seasons of the little ice age  french and english farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy  these walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm  early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south  but over time  sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight  in 1699  nicolas fatio de duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the sun  69  applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water  drying crops  brooding chicks and drying chicken manure  44  70  more recently the technology has been embraced by vintners  who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses  71 
greenhouses convert solar light to heat  enabling year-round production and the growth  in enclosed environments  of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate  primitive greenhouses were first used during roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the roman emperor tiberius  72  the first modern greenhouses were built in europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad  73  greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today  and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers

development of a solar-powered car has been an engineering goal since the 1980s  the world solar challenge is a biannual solar-powered car race  where teams from universities and enterprises compete over 3,021 kilometres  1,877mi  across central australia from darwin to adelaide  in 1987  when it was founded  the winner s average speed was 67 kilometres per hour  42mph  and by 2007 the winner s average speed had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour  56.46mph   74  the north american solar challenge and the planned south african solar challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles  75  76 
some vehicles use solar panels for auxiliary power  such as for air conditioning  to keep the interior cool  thus reducing fuel consumption  77  78 
in 1975  the first practical solar boat was constructed in england  79  by 1995  passenger boats incorporating pv panels began appearing and are now used extensively  80  in 1996  kenichi horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the pacific ocean  and the sun21 catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of the atlantic ocean in the winter of 20062007  81  there were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010  82

solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions  these processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels  solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical  88  a variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis  89  the multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels  such as methanol  from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging  a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons  though use of water as the source of electrons  as plants do  requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen  90  some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050
the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system  91  another vision involves all human structures covering the earth s surface  i e   roads  vehicles and buildings  doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants  92 
hydrogen production technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s  aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells  several thermochemical processes have also been explored  one such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures  2,3002,600c or 4,2004,700f   93  another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods  94  thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production  the solzinc process under development at the weizmann institute of science uses a 1mw solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide  zno  at temperatures above 1,200c  2,200f   this initial reaction produces pure zinc  which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen  95

phase change materials such as paraffin wax and glauber s salt are another thermal storage medium  these materials are inexpensive  readily available  and can deliver domestically useful temperatures  approximately 64c or 147f   the  dover house   in dover  massachusetts  was the first to use a glauber s salt heating system  in 1948  98  solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts  salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost  have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems  the solar two project used this method of energy storage  allowing it to store 1.44 terajoules  400,000kwh  in its 68 m storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99   99 
off-grid pv systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity  with grid-tied systems  excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid  while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls  net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid  this is handled by  rolling back  the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes  if the net electricity use is below zero  the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month  100  other approaches involve the use of two meters  to measure electricity consumed vs  electricity produced  this is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter  most standard meters accurately measure in both directions  making a second meter unnecessary 
pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one  the energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water  with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator  101

main article  deployment of solar power to energy grids
see also  cost of electricity by source
beginning with the surge in coal use which accompanied the industrial revolution  energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels  the early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce  however  development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury in the face of the increasing availability  economy  and utility of coal and petroleum  102 
the 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies  103  104  deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the federal photovoltaic utilization program in the u s  and the sunshine program in japan  other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the u s   seri  now nrel   japan  nedo   and germany  fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise   105 
commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the united states in the 1890s  106  these systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels  107  as with photovoltaics  solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices  development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20  since 1999  26  although generally underestimated  solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154gw as of 2007  26 
the international energy agency has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces  1 
the development of affordable  inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits  it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous  inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource  enhance sustainability  reduce pollution  lower the costs of mitigating climate change  and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise  these advantages are global  hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments  they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared  1 
in 2011  a report by the international energy agency found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics  solar hot water and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the worlds energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting climate change  the energy from the sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters   the strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications  from small scale to big scale   108 
we have proved     that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun 
frank shuman  new york times  2 july 1916 23 
iso standards
the international organization for standardization has established several standards relating to solar energy equipment  for example  iso 9050 relates to glass in building while iso 10217 relates to the materials used in solar water heaters
