planetary management is intentional global-scale management of earth s biological  chemical and physical processes and cycles  water  carbon  nitrogen  sulfur  phosphorus  and others   planetary management also includes managing humanitys influence on planetary-scale processes  1  effective planetary management aims to prevent destabilisation of earth s climate  protect biodiversity and maintain or improve human well-being  more specifically  it aims to benefit society and the global economy  and safeguard the ecosystem services upon which humanity depends  global climate  freshwater supply  food  energy  clean air  fertile soil  pollinators  and so on 
because of the sheer complexity and enormous scope of the task  it remains to be seen whether planetary management is a feasible paradigm for maintaining global sustainability  the concept currently has defenders and critics on both sides  environmentalist david w  orr questions whether such a task can be accomplished with human help and technology or without first examining the underlying human causes  2  while geographer vaclav smil acknowledges that  the idea of planetary management may seem preposterous to many  but at this time in history there is no rational alternative   3

background edit 
the term has been around in science fiction novels since the 1970s  citation needed  in 2004  the international geosphere-biosphere programme published global change and the earth system  a planet under pressure  4  the publications executive summary concluded  an overall  comprehensive  internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the earth system is required  it stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment  in 2009  the planetary boundaries concept was published in the science journal nature  the paper identifies nine boundaries in the earth system  remaining within these nine boundaries  the authors suggest  may safeguard the current equilibrium 
in 2007  france called for unep to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization  the united nations environment organization  the rationale was that uneps status as a programme  rather than an organization in the tradition of the world health organization or the world meteorological organization  weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of earth  the call was backed by 46 countries  notably  the top five emitters of greenhouse gases failed to support the call  5
