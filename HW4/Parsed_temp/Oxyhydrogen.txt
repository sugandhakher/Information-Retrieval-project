nineteenth-century electrolytic cell for producing oxyhydrogen 
oxyhydrogen is a mixture of hydrogen  h2  and oxygen  o2  gases  this gaseous mixture is used for torches to process refractory materials and was the first 1  gaseous mixture used for welding  theoretically  a ratio of 2 1 hydrogen oxygen is enough to achieve maximum efficiency  in practice a ratio 4 1 or 5 1 is needed to avoid an oxidizing flame  2 
this mixture may also be referred to as knallgas  scandinavian and german knallgas   bang-gas    although some authors define knallgas to be a generic term for the mixture of fuel with the precise amount of oxygen required for complete combustion  thus 2 1 oxyhydrogen would be called  hydrogen-knallgas   3 
brown s gas 4  and hho are fringe science terms for a 2 1 mixture of oxyhydrogen obtained under certain special conditions  its proponents claim that it has special properties

properties edit 
oxyhydrogen will combust when brought to its autoignition temperature  for the stoichiometric mixture  2 1 hydrogen oxygen  at normal atmospheric pressure  autoignition occurs at about 570c  1065f   5  dead link  the minimum energy required to ignite such a mixture with a spark is about 20 microjoules  5  dead link  at standard temperature and pressure  oxyhydrogen can burn when it is between about 4  and 95  hydrogen by volume  5  dead link 
when ignited  the gas mixture converts to water vapor and releases energy  which sustains the reaction  241.8 kj of energy  lhv  for every mole of h2 burned  the amount of heat energy released is independent of the mode of combustion  but the temperature of the flame varies  6  the maximum temperature of about 2,800c  5,100f  is achieved with an exact stoichiometric mixture  about 700c  1,300f  hotter than a hydrogen flame in air  7  8  9  when either of the gases are mixed in excess of this ratio  or when mixed with an inert gas like nitrogen  the heat must spread throughout a greater quantity of matter and the temperature will be lower  6 
production edit 
a pure stoichiometric mixture may be obtained by water electrolysis  which uses an electric current to dissociate the water molecules 
electrolysis  2 h2o  2 h2   o2
combustion  2 h2   o2  2 h2o
william nicholson was the first to decompose water in this manner in 1800  in theory  the input energy of a closed system will always equal the output energy  as the first law of thermodynamics states  however  in practice no systems are perfectly closed  and the energy required to generate the oxyhydrogen will always exceed the energy released by combusting it  even at maximum practical efficiency  as the second law of thermodynamics implies   see electrolysis of water efficiency  
applications edit 
limelights used an oxyhydrogen flame as a high-temperature heat source
lighting edit 
many forms of oxyhydrogen lamps have been described  such as the limelight  which used an oxyhydrogen flame to heat a piece of lime to white hot incandescence  10  because of the explosiveness of the oxyhydrogen  limelights have been replaced by electric lighting 
oxyhydrogen blowpipe edit 
nineteenth-century bellows-operated oxy-hydrogen blowpipe  including two different types of flashback arrestor
the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe was developed by english mineralogist edward daniel clarke and american chemist robert hare in the early nineteenth century  it produced a flame hot enough to melt such refractory materials as platinum  porcelain  fire brick  and corundum  and was a valuable tool in several fields of science  11  it is used in the verneuil process to produce synthetic corundum  citation needed 
oxyhydrogen torch edit 
an oxyhydrogen torch is an oxy-gas torch  which burns hydrogen  the fuel  with oxygen  the oxidizer   it is used for cutting and welding  12  metals  glass  and thermoplastics  10 
due to competition from the acetylene-fueled cutting torch and from arc welding  the oxyhydrogen torch is seldom used today  but it remains the preferred cutting tool in some niche applicationssee oxy-fuel welding and cutting 
oxyhydrogen was once used in working platinum because at the time such a torch was the only device that could attain the temperature required to melt the metal 1,768.3c  3,214.9f   6  these techniques have been superseded by the electric arc furnace 
brown s gas
 edit 
 brown s gas  is oxyhydrogen with a 2 1 molar ratio of h2 and o2 gases  the same proportion as in water  it is named after yull brown  who claimed that it could be used as a fuel for the internal combustion engine  4  13  it s also called  hho gas  after the claims of fringe physicist 14  ruggero santilli  who claims that his hho gas  produced by a special apparatus  is  a new form of water   with new properties  based on his fringe theory of  magnecules   13 
many other pseudoscientific claims have been made about brown s gas s pretended ability to neutralize radioactive waste  help plants to germinate  etc  13 
oxyhydrogen is often mentioned in conjunction with vehicles that claim to use water as a fuel  the most common and decisive counter-argument against producing this gas on board to use as a fuel or fuel additive is that more energy is needed to split water molecules than is recouped by burning the resulting gas  4  15  additionally  the volume of gas that can be produced for on-demand consumption through electrolysis is very small in comparison to the volume consumed by an internal combustion engine  16 
an article in popular mechanics reported that brown s gas does not increase the fuel economy in automobiles  17 
 water-fueled  cars should not be confused with hydrogen-fueled cars  where the hydrogen is produced elsewhere and used as fuel or where it is used as fuel enhancement
