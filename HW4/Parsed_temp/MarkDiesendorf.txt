biography edit 
diesendorf is the son of the engineer walter diesendorf and the poet margaret diesendorf  his phd research was focused on applied mathematics and theoretical physics applied to the solar interior  his early postdoctoral research was diverse  including the analysis of ground and satellite data on vlf emissions  mechanisms of insect smell and vision  and biological catalysts  from 1975 to 1985 he worked in the csiro division of mathematics  the australian national research organisation  on topics such as the integration of wind power into electricity grids  1  he became a principal research scientist and leader of the applied mathematics group in csiro  2  he left csiro in 1985 after the organisation had terminated all research on renewable energy  from 1996 to 2001 he was professor of environmental science and founding director of the institute for sustainable futures at uts and then director of a company sustainability centre pty ltd 
from 2004 to 2016  diesendorf has been a senior lecturer and then associate professor and deputy director of the institute of environmental studies at the university of nsw  now called unsw australia  in 2015 ies was abolished by the university and diesendorf retired  nominally  in mid-2016 to become honorary associate professor at unsw  he continues to teach  as a guest lecturer   research and consult in the interdisciplinary fields of sustainable energy  sustainable urban transport  theory of sustainability  ecological economics  and practical processes by which government  business and other organisations can achieve ecologically sustainable and socially just development  3

much of his recent and current research is on climate mitigation  especially transitioning electricity supply systems to 100  renewable energy  to this end he is involved with colleagues in the centre for energy   environmental markets at unsw in scenario development  computer simulation modelling and energy policy  previously dr diesendorf was one of the leading proponents calling for the ethical  scientific debate over public water fluoridation  4  on this issue diesendorf has authored several papers  including a major 1986 article entitled  the mystery of declining tooth decay  in the journal nature  examining the need for a scientific re-evaluation of fluoridation  and has highlighted some of the contrary evidence  1  5
