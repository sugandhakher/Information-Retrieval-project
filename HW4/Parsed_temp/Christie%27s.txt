history edit 
founding edit 
in a peep at christies  1796   james gillray caricatured actress elizabeth farren and huntsman lord derby examining paintings appropriate to their tastes and heights 
the official company literature states that founder james christie conducted the first sale in london  england  on 5 december 1766  4  and the earliest auction catalogue the company retains is from december 1766  however  other sources note that james christie rented auction rooms from 1762  and newspaper advertisements of christie s sales dating from 1759 have also been traced  5  christie s soon established a reputation as a leading auction house  and took advantage of london s new found status as the major centre of the international art trade after the french revolution  from 1859  the company was called christie  manson   woods  in 1958  it established its first overseas office  by placing a representative in rome  the first overseas salesroom opened in geneva  where christie s holds jewellery auctions 
19731999 edit 
the microcosm of london  1808   an engraving of christie s auction room
christie s was a public company  listed on the london stock exchange from 1973 to 1999  in 1974  jo floyd was appointed chairman of christie s  he served as chairman of christie s international p l c  from 1976 to 1988  until handing over to lord carrington  and later was a non-executive member of the board of directors until 1992  6  the auction house s subsidiary christie s international inc  held its first sale in the united states in 1977  13 years later than sotheby s  christie s growth was slow but steady since 1989  when it had 42 percent of the auction market  7  in 1990  the company reversed a longstanding policy and guaranteed a minimum price for a collection of artworks in its may auctions  8  in 1996  the auction house s sales eclipsed sotheby s for the first time since 1954  9  however  its profits did not grow at the same pace  10  from 1993 through 1997  christie s annual pretax profits were about  60 million  whereas sotheby s annual pretax profits were about  265 million for those years  11 
in 1993  christie s paid  10.9 million for the london gallery spink   sons  which specialised in oriental art and british paintings  the gallery was run as a separate entity from the auction house  the company bought leger gallery for  3.3 million in 1996  and merged it with spink to become spink-leger  12  spink-leger was closed in 2002  to make itself competitive with sotheby s in real estate  christie s bought great estates in 1995  then the largest network of independent real estate brokers in north america  changing its name to christie s great estates inc  7 
1998 takeover edit 
in december 1997  under the chairmanship of lord hindlip  christie s put itself on the auction block  but after two months of negotiations with the consortium-led investment firm sbc warburg dillon read it did not attract a bid high enough to accept  11  in may 1998  franois pinault s holding company  groupe artmis s a   first bought 29.1 percent of the company for  243.2 million  and subsequently purchased the rest of it in a deal that valued the entire company at  1.2 billion  10  the company has since not been reporting profits  though it gives sale totals twice a year  its policy  in line with u k  accounting standards  is to convert non-u k  results using an average exchange rate weighted daily by sales throughout the year  13  in 2002  christie s france held its first auction in paris  14 
like sotheby s  christie s became increasingly involved in high-profile private transactions  in 2006  christie s offered a reported  21 million guarantee to the donald judd foundation and displayed the artist s works for five weeks in an exhibition that later won an aica award for  best installation in an alternative space   15  in 2007 the auction house brokered a  68 million deal that transferred thomas eakins s the gross clinic  1875  from the jefferson medical college at the thomas jefferson university in philadelphia to joint ownership by the philadelphia museum of art and the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts  16  that same year  haunch of venison  a contemporary art gallery which since 2002 had successfully conducted back-room sales of secondary-market works by major artists such as francis bacon  andy warhol  and damien hirst from its locations in london and zrich  17  became a subsidiary of christie s international plc  18  under the original deal  the gallery was meant to be the channel for all of christie s private-client business as well as the focus of its primary trade  19  also  the auction house originally announced that haunch employees could not bid at auction because of conflicts of interest or issues of market manipulation  but later abandoned this rule  20  while christie s eventually retained the brand name and repositioned haunch as purely a primary-focused gallery  any secondary-market activities were taken over by the auction house s post-war and contemporary department  21  today  the gallery continues to operate as an independent company in london and new york  and again handles all of its secondary market activities itself  22 
on 28 december 2008  the sunday times reported that pinault s debts left him  considering  the sale of christie s and that a number of  private equity groups  were thought to be interested in its acquisition  23  in january 2009  christie s was reported to employ 2,100 people worldwide  though an unspecified number of staff and consultants were soon to be cut due to a worldwide downturn in the art market  24  later news reports said that 300 jobs would be cut  25  with sales for premier impressionist  modern  and contemporary artworks tallying only  us248.8 million in comparison to  us739 million just a year before  a second round of job cuts began after may 2009 when the auction house was still reported to employ 1,900 people worldwide  26  one of the auction house s  rainmakers  in the sale of impressionist and modern art  guy bennett  resigned from the auction house just prior to the beginning of the summer 2009 sales season  27  although the economic downturn has encouraged some collectors to sell art  others are unwilling to sell in a market which may yield only bargain prices  25 
today edit 
christie s chinese preview exhibition
frenchwoman madame patricia barbizet was appointed chief executive officer of christies in 2014  the first female ceo of the company  28  as of 2012  impressionist works  which dominated the market during the 1980s boom  have been replaced by contemporary art as christie s top category  asian art was the third most-lucrative area  13  with income from classic auctioneering falling  treaty sales made 413.4 million   665 million  in the first half of 2012  an increase of 53  on the same period last year  they now represent more than 18  of turnover  29  the company has promoted curated events  centred on a theme rather than an art classification or time period  30
