us eia monthly capacity factors 2011-2013
the net capacity factor of a power plant is the ratio of its actual output over a period of time  to its potential output if it were possible for it to operate at full nameplate capacity continuously over the same period of time  to calculate the capacity factor  take the total amount of energy the plant produced during a period of time and divide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity  capacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of fuel that is used and the design of the plant  the capacity factor should not be confused with the availability factor  capacity credit  firm capacity  or with efficiency

nuclear power capacity factor
a nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts  mw  might produce 648,000 megawatt-hours  mwh  in a 30-day month  the number of megawatt-hours that would have been produced had the plant been operating at full capacity can be determined by multiplying the plant s maximum capacity by the number of hours in the time period  1,000mw 30days 24hours day is 720,000mwh  the capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual output with the maximum possible output  in this case  the capacity factor is 0.9  90    1

palo verde nuclear generating station is the largest nuclear plant in the us with a nameplate capacity of 3,942 mw between its three reactors  with an annual generation of 31,200,000 mwh in 2010  2  the capacity factor was 90.4

each of palo verdes three reactors is refueled every 18 months  with one refueling every spring and fall  in 2014  a refueling was completed in a record 28 days  3 
wind farm edit 
the danish wind farm horns rev 2  the world s largest in 2009  4  comprises 91 siemens swt-2.3-93 wind turbines each of 2.3 mw  with a nominal total capacity of 209 mw 
in 2012  the wind farm generated 956 gwh of electricity  5  the capacity factor for this wind farm was 52.1

onshore wind farms can reach capacity factors of over 60   for example the 44 mw eolo plant in nicaragua had a net generation of 232.132 mwh in 2015  equivalent to a capacity factor of 60.2   6 
note that capacity factor is not constrained by the betz limit so capacities higher that 59.2  are possible  this is because capacity measures actual production relative to possible production by the turbine  as opposed to production vs  energy available in the wind 
hydroelectric dam edit 
large rivers or large reservoirs in wet mountainous areas are ideal water supplies for hydropower  in western canada the peace and columbia rivers support capacity factors averaging 85  of a 10,000mw capacity in the mild  rainy oceanic climate  7 
 8  as of 2010  three gorges dam is the largest power generating station in the world by nameplate capacity  in 2009  not yet fully complete  it had 26 main generator units  700mw and two auxiliary generator units  50mw for a total installed capacity of 18,300mw  total generation in 2009 was 79.47twh  for a capacity factor of just under 50

reasons for reduced capacity factor edit

there are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100   the first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance  this accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants  base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output  geothermal plants  nuclear plants  coal-fired plants and bioenergy plants that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants 
the second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100  is that output is curtailed or intentionally left idle because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical  this accounts for most of the unused capacity of peaking power plants  peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day  their electricity is relatively expensive  however  it is only relatively expensive if determining the cost per unit of electricity be dividing total costs of production and operation by the power produced  its electricity may be  relatively expensive   but the cost to construct and operate and maintain the plant may be a fraction of those of a mainline powerplant  clearly a peaking powerplant is not constructed to cheaply produce electricity  it is constructed to increase the efficiency and therefore reduce the costs of the utility as a whole  if the alternative to  expensive  peaking power is selling no power during periods of excessive demand that create blackouts or damage to equipment and facilities during brownouts  the peaking power becomes very cheap very quickly 
many other power plants operate only at certain times of the day or times of the year because of variation in loads and electricity prices  if a plant is only needed during the day  for example  even if it operates at full power output from 8 am to 8 pm every day all year long  it would only have a 50  capacity factor  e g  that assertion falls apart if the power plant was designed and constructed for that exact purpose  if a powerplant is designed  intended and constructed or even later simply allocated and used to produce electrictity 12 hours per day  its capacity factor is 100  rather than 50   put another way  does any person consider themselves lazy 66  of the time simply because they only work 8 hours of a 24-hour day 
a third reason is that a plant may not have the fuel available to operate all of the time  this can apply to fossil generating stations with restricted fuels supplies  but most notably applies to intermittent renewable resources  when the sun isn t shining  solar pv cannot produce electricity  when the wind is not blowing  wind turbines cannot produce electricity  solar pv and wind turbines have a capacity factor limited by the availability of their  fuel   sunshine and wind respectively  again  the flawed concept of  capacity factor  equates inactivity directly to inefficiency  while wind turbines don t produce power when there is no wind  they re also not being subjected to the wear and tear that come with operation  and calm periods allow maintenance and repairs to be performed without removing the unit from service when it could be operating 
a hydroelectricity plant may have a capacity factor lower than 100  due to scarcity of water  however  its output may also simply be regulated to match the current power need  conserving its stored water for later usage  a hydroelectricity plant may also be designed for reverse usage so it can pump water up in its reservoir in situations with a power surplus  in both cases the use of the hydroelectricity plant to stabilize the grid reduces its capacity factor 
hydroelectricity may have a higher capacity factor with respect to the turbine size since in some case the amount of stored water fluctuates to account for intermittent availability of water  given the nearly impossible task of actually designing and constructing a hydroelectric facility to deliver the precise waterflow required to operate the generators at nameplate capacity  applying the already dubious  capacity factor  to hydroelectric powerplants borders on absurdity 
in many cases  hydroelectric power production is a secondary function of the dam and reservoir and it is used only to produce and sell power to produce revenue used to offset the costs of operating and maintaining the dam and reservoir  some dams and reservoirs were primarily built for flood control or irrigation and are operated to perform those functions as required with electricity production occurring only when it is economically feasible and profitable to do so 
even an apparently  full  reservoir may not be sufficient to power a hydroelectric powerplant to its rated output  typically hydroelectric plants are rated using a specific  head  determined to be the minimum water leve required to produce 100  capacity  however  the temperature and density of the water determine the kinetic energy it will produce as it travels from inlet to generator turbine  additional factors such as fouling of the spillway or piping  wear and damage of the turbine rotor and backpressure downstream from the turbine can also reduce capacity even with ideal  head  available 
further  since inflow into reservoirs is constantly changing and variable as are various other conditions affecting the amount of time required for water to  transit  the reservoir and hydroelectric plant  designing and building a hydroelectric plant capable of perfectly matching generating capacity to water availability is impossible 
reservoirs are constantly although perhaps imperceptibly rising and falling with resulting changes in generating capacity  and in reservoir powerplant systems where a constant head can be maintained  it is invariable maintained by allowing excess water to exit the reservoir through spillways that bypass the generators  in such installation  water released to bypass is wasted entirely for purposes of generating electricity even when bypassing it increases the efficiency and capacity of the powerplant itself 
other reasons that a power plant may not have a capacity factor of 100  include restrictions or limitations on air permits and limitations on transmission that force the plant to curtail output 
by far the biggest reality affecting  capacity factor  is the need to perform periodic maintenance on components and systems within the powerplant and to replace or repair components when they fail or reach the end of their designed service life  because electricity is readily available with the flip of switch all around us  it is easy for some people to forget that powerplants are mechanical devices and systems and eventually they wear out  this reality makes the entire concept of  capacity factor  even more questionable given that the closer to its supposedly ideal  capacity factor  of 100  a powerplant is operated  the more maintenance and repair it will require  as such  a 100   capacity factor  is now only imposssible to achieve  it would be undesirable to do so if it were possible 
running a powerplant at 100   capacity factor  until something catastrophically fails or wear prevents safe or efficient operation would be analogous to driving your car at its maximum speed as long as possible as often as possible in order to wear it out as quickly as possible and maximize ownership costs as much as possible  but while a mechanic can install a new engine in your car in a few days  major repairs and maintenance tasks in powerplants can require shutdown for weeks  months and even years in some cases 
load following power plants edit 
load following power plants  also called intermediate power plants  are in between these extremes in terms of capacity factor  efficiency and cost per unit of electricity  they produce most of their electricity during the day  when prices and demand are highest  however  the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight 
capacity factor and renewable energy edit 
us eia monthly capacity factors for renewables  2011-2013
when it comes to several renewable energy sources such as solar power  wind power and hydroelectricity  there is a fourth reason for unused capacity  the plant may be capable of producing electricity  but its  fuel   wind  sunlight or water  may not be available  a hydroelectric plant s production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for fish downstream  however  solar  wind and hydroelectric plants do have high availability factors  so when they have fuel available  they are almost always able to produce electricity  10 
when hydroelectric plants have water available  they are also useful for load following  because of their high dispatchability  a typical hydroelectric plant s operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes 
wind farms are variable  due to the natural variability of the wind  for a wind farm  the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind  transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor  typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45   though current 110 meter towers can have up to 55  capacity factor  and future 140 meter towers are expected to have up to 65  capacity factor  11 
solar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth  seasonal changes  and because of cloud cover  according to  12  the sacramento municipal utility district observed a 15  capacity factor in 2005  however  according to the solarpaces programme of the international energy agency  iea   solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands  such as spain or the south-western united states  13  although in some locations solar pv does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is reduced  14  15  solarpaces states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of solar thermal power  csp  stations can be extended to become dispatchable  load following   13  the iea csp technology roadmap  2010  suggests that  in the sunniest countries  csp can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by 2020  and of base-load power by 2025 to 2030   16  a dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power  17 
geothermal has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources  and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day  7 days a week  while the carrier medium for geothermal electricity  water  must be properly managed  the source of geothermal energy  the earth s heat  will be available for the foreseeable future  18  geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth
