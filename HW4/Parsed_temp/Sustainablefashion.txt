origin and purpose edit 
sustainable fashion is part of the larger trend of sustainable design where a product is created and produced with consideration to the environmental and social impact it may have throughout its total life span  including its  carbon footprint   according to the may 2007 vogue  sustainable fashion  does not appear to be a short-term trend but one that could last multiple seasons  the very word season being up for grabs in a climate-affected world   1 
while environmentalism used to manifest itself in the fashion world through a donation of percentage of sales of a product to a charitable cause  fashion designers are now re-introducing eco-conscious methods at the source through the use of environmentally friendly materials and socially responsible methods of production 
according to earth pledge  a non-profit organization committed to promoting and supporting sustainable development   at least 8,000 chemicals are used to turn raw materials into textiles and 25  of the world s pesticides are used to grow non-organic cotton  this causes irreversible damage to people and the environment  and still two thirds of a garment s carbon footprint will occur after it is purchased   2 
with the average american throwing away nearly 70 pounds of clothing per year  3  the fashion industry is the second largest cause of pollution worldwide  4 
slow fashion edit 
see also  slow movement  culture  fashion
unlike fast fashion  slow fashion production ensures quality manufacturing to lengthen the life of the garment  developing a garment with a cultural and emotional connection is also pertinent to the purpose behind slow fashion  consumers will keep an article of clothing longer than one season if they feel emotionally or culturally connected to the article of clothing  5  a taxation is in early stages of development in order to deter fashion companies from purchasing or producing materials that are not made with recycled  chemical-free or re-purposed materials  6  utilizing materials already made will reduce the industry s carbon footprint  6 
materials edit 
there are many factors when considering the sustainability of a material  the renewability and source of a fiber  the process of how a raw fiber is turned into a textile  the working conditions of the people producing the materials  and the material s total carbon footprint 
natural fibers edit 
natural fibers are fibers which are found in nature and are not petroleum-based  natural fibres can be categorized into two main groups  cellulose or plant fiber and protein or animal fiber  uses of these fibers can be anything from buttons to eyewear like sunglasses  7 
cellulose edit 
cotton is one of the most widely grown and chemical-intensive crops in the world  8  conventionally grown cotton uses approximately 25  of the world s insecticides and more than 10  of the world s pesticides  9  other cellulose fibers include  jute  flax  hemp  ramie  abaca  bamboo  used for viscose   soy  corn  banana  pineapple  beechwood  used for rayon  
protein edit 
natural protein fibers include  wool  silk  angora  camel  alpaca  llama  vicuna  cashmere  and mohair 
manufactured edit 
fibers manufactured from natural materials include  lyocell and polylactic acid  pla  
recycled fibers edit 
recycled or reclaimed fibers are made from scraps of fabrics collected from clothing factories  which are processed back into short fibers for spinning into a new yarn  there are only a few facilities globally that are able to process the clippings  citation needed  variations range from a blend of recycled cotton fibers with added repet yarns for strength to recycled cotton fibres with virgin acrylic fibers which are added for color consistency and strength 
upcycled fibers edit 
upcycled fibers are made from materials that are not originally used to make fibers  or they were thrown away being considered trash from origin  this includes fibers made of plastic and gillnets  an example of the use of this type of fiber can be seen in the shoe adidas made with parley for the oceans  10 
another example is fish leather made from fish skins that are a by-product of the food industry  11  fish leather tanning is less harmful on the environment due to no hair-removal being required  leading to less solid waste and organic pollutants in the wastewater from the process  citation needed  also  no poisonous  explosive hydrogen sulfide gas is released in the process  12 
designers edit

controversy edit 
though all cotton has a large carbon footprint for its cultivation and production  organic cotton is considered a more sustainable choice for fabric  as it is completely free of destructive toxic pesticides and chemical fertilizers  many designers have begun experimenting with bamboo fiber  which absorbs greenhouse gases during its life cycle and grows quickly and plentifully without pesticides  39  even with this  bamboo fabric can cause environmental harm in production due to the chemicals used to create a soft viscose from hard bamboo  40  some believe that stalk fibres and particularly hemp is one of the best choice for eco fabrics due to its ease of growth  though it remains illegal to grow in some countries  citation needed  these facts regarding production of new materials make recycled  reclaimed  surplus  and vintage fabric arguably the most sustainable choice  as the raw material requires no agriculture and no manufacturing to produce  citation needed
