a carbon diet refers to reducing the impact on climate change by reducing greenhouse gas  principally co2  production 
individuals and businesses produce carbon dioxide from daily activities such as driving  heating  and the consumption of products and services  to reduce the effects of climate change  we could reduce our carbon output by going on a carbon diet 
there are references to the use of the term carbon diet in several publications 
the term  carbon diet  is used in the book gore  a political life 1 
 and many scientists and economists maintain that the costs of adapting to any change are both easier to achieve politically and more efficacious scientifically than trying to avoid the problem through a crash carbon diet  
deborah jones from the globe   mail newspaper writes  it s week two of my family s  carbon diet  -- a globe and mail assignment to see how my family of four adults can cut its greenhouse-gas emissions to match the provincial goal of a 33-per-cent reduction     2 
this differs from a low carbon diet which refers to making choices about eating that reduce greenhouse gas emissions
