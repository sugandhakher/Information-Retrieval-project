velomobile  the most efficient means of passenger transportation
energy efficiency in transportation is  strictly speaking  useful output  kilometers  miles  etc   divided by total energy input  kilowatt-hour  amount of gasoline  etc    this is more precisely known as fuel economy  symbol fe   and may be measured in units of km l or mi gal  mpg   1  2 
energy efficiency in transportation is often  and confusingly  described in terms of fuel consumption  symbol fc   fuel consumption is the reciprocal of fuel economy 2  and is occasionally known as energy intensity  3  it equals fuel  energy  divided by distance  and is often measured in units of liters per 100 kilometers  l 100km   joules per kilometer  j km   gallon-equivalent per 100 miles  gale 100mi   or kilowatt-hours per distance  kw-hr km or kw-hr mi  
the energy efficiency in transportation varies by mode of transportation  listed below   different types of transportation range from some hundred kilojoules per kilometre  kj km  for a bicycle to tens of megajoules per kilometer  mj km  for a helicopter

units of measurement edit 
both fuel economy and fuel consumption are often given on a per-vehicle basis  more refined units of measurement exist  such as fuel consumption per passenger or fuel consumption per mass of cargo 
energy efficiency is expressed in terms of fuel economy  2 
distance per vehicle per unit fuel volume  e g   km l or miles per gallon  us or imperial  
distance per vehicle per unit fuel mass  e g   km kg  4 
distance per vehicle per unit energy  e g   miles per gallon equivalent  mpg-e  
energy intensity  reciprocal efficiency  3  is expressed terms of fuel consumption  2 
volume of fuel  or total energy  consumed per unit distance per vehicle  e g  l 100km or mj 100km 
volume of fuel  or total energy  consumed per unit distance per passenger  e g   l  100passengerkm  
volume of fuel  or total energy  consumed per unit distance per unit mass of cargo transported  e g   l 100kgkm or mj tkm 
electricity used per vehicle per unit distance  e g   kwh 100km 
transportation types edit 
for freight transport  rail and ship transport are generally much more efficient than trucking  and air freight is much less efficient  5  6 
walking edit 
nordic walkers
a 68kg  150lb  person walking at 4km h  2.5mph  requires approximately 210 kilocalories  880kj  of food energy per hour  which is equivalent to 4.55km mj  7  1usgal  3.8l  of gasoline contains about 114,000 british thermal units  120mj  8  of energy  so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon  0.65l 100km  
velomobile edit 
main article  velomobile
velomobiles seem to have the highest energy efficiency in personal transportation  at a speed of 50km h  31mph  the waw manufacturer claims they need only 0.5kwh of food energy per 100km to transport the passenger  which is around 15  20   of a normal bicycle  and 150  2   of an average fossil fuel or electric car  this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon  2000km l  0.05l 100km   9  other sources give a figure of 13.4  29.5   of the energy use of a normal bicycle  10 
bicycling edit 
a chinese flying pigeon bicycle
a relatively light and slow vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain  the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport  compared with walking  a 64kg  140lb  cyclist riding at 16km h  10mph  requires about half the food energy per unit distance  43kcal mi  27kcal km or 3.1kwh  11mj  per 100km  7  this converts to about 732mpg-us  0.321l 100km  879mpg-imp   11  this figure depends on the speed and mass of the rider  greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance 
a motorized bicycle allows human power and the assistance of a 49cm3  3.0cuin  engine  giving a range of 160to 200mpg-us  1.51.2l 100km  190240mpg-imp   citation needed  electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0kwh  3.6mj  per 100km  citation needed  while maintaining speeds in excess of 30km h  19mph   citation needed  these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70  of the work  with around 3.6mj  1.0kwh  per 100km coming from the motor 
human power edit 
to be thorough  a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing  transporting and packaging of fuel  food or fossil fuel   the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste  and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle  this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment  while automobiles  for example  require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans  in addition  any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity  in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40 
automobiles edit

bugatti veyron
automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres  l 100km   but in some countries  including the usa  uk and india  it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed  km l or miles per us or imperial gallon   this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel  the oak ridge national laboratory  ornl  states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 british thermal unit  btu  per us gallon  32mj l  compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon  36.4mj l  for diesel  12 
a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy  bio-fuels  electricity and hydrogen  for instance  have significant energy inputs in their production  because of this  the 5070  efficiency of hydrogen production has to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency  13 
a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle  as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases  however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger  we can compare  for instance  the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area 14  to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58  15 
finally  vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself  this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span  in other words  vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not  and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem  compare  for example  walking  which requires no special equipment at all  and an automobile  produced in and shipped from another country  and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again  and used for a limited number of years 
driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15   16  17 
example consumption figures edit 
two american solar cars in canada
solar cars use no fuel  charging the batteries entirely from built-in solar panels  and typically use less than 3kwh per 100miles  67kj km or 1.86kwh 100km   18 
the four passenger gem ner uses 169wh mi  203mpg-e  10.5kwh 100km   19  which equates to 2.6kwh 100km per person when fully occupied  albeit at only 24mph  39km h  
the general motors ev1 was rated in a test with a charging efficiency of 373 wh-ac mile or 23 kwh 100km 20  approximately equivalent to 2.6l 100km  110mpg-imp  90mpg-us  for petroleum-fuelled vehicles 
chevrolet volt in full electric mode uses 36 kilowatt-hours per 100 miles  810kj km  96mpg-e   meaning it may be more energy-efficient than walking for 4 or more passengers 
the daihatsu charade 993cc turbo diesel  19871993  won the most fuel efficient vehicle award for going round the united kingdom consuming an average of 2.82l 100km  100mpg-imp   it was surpassed only recently by the vw lupo 3l which consumes about 2.77l 100km  102mpg-imp   both cars are rare to find on the popular market  the daihatsu had major problems with rust and structural safety which contributes to its rarity and the quite short production run 
the volkswagen polo 1.4 tdi bluemotion and the seat ibiza 1.4 tdi ecomotion  both rated at 3.8l 100km  74mpg-imp  62mpg-us   combined  were the most fuel efficient cars on sale in the uk as of 22 march 2008  21  22  23  needs update

aircraft edit

solar impulse 2  a solar aircraft
a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is drag  which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress 
drag is proportional to the lift required for flight  29  which is equal to the weight of the aircraft  as induced drag increases with weight  mass reduction  with improvements in engine efficiency and reductions in aerodynamic drag  has been a principal source of efficiency gains in aircraft  with a rule-of-thumb being that a 1  weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75  reduction in fuel consumption  29 
flight altitude affects engine efficiency  jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the tropopause  the temperature minimum of the atmosphere  at lower temperatures  the carnot efficiency is higher  29  jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds  but above about mach 0.85 the airframe aerodynamic losses increase faster 
compressibility effects  beginning at transonic speeds of around mach 0.85  shockwaves form increasing drag 
for supersonic flight  it is difficult to achieve a lift to drag ratio greater than 5  and fuel consumption is increased in proportion

passenger airplanes averaged 4.8 l 100km per passenger  1.4 mj passenger-km   49 passenger-miles per gallon  in 1998  citation needed  note that on average 20  of seats are left unoccupied  jet aircraft efficiencies are improving  between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55  overall fuel efficiency gain  if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case   32  most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use  compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s  current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile  33  between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4   concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon  similar to a business jet  but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft  airbus puts the fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l 100km per passenger  78 passenger-miles per us gallon   34 
air france airbus a380-800
the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium  carbon fiber and other composite plastics  expensive materials may be used  if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency  the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction  reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried  this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency  for example  the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials 
airbus has showcased wingtip devices  sharklets or winglets  that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption  35  36  there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380  further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption  37  winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing smooth out the wing-tip vortex  reducing the aircraft s wing drag  and can be retrofitted to any airplane  37 
nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500lb  230kg   blended wing  aircraft  this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift  not just the wings  38  the blended wing body  bwb  concept offers advantages in structural  aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today s more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs  these features translate into greater range  fuel economy  reliability and life cycle savings  as well as lower manufacturing costs  39  40  nasa has created a cruise efficient stol  cestol  concept 
fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research  ifam  have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect  41  aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint 
propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops  but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450mph  700km h   42  this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today  however  the decrease in speed reduces drag  with the current  needs update  high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engine airframe efficiency to reduce emissions  there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb  for instance  airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans  43  nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project  atp   where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds 
related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate

cunard states that rmsqueen elizabeth 2 travels 49.5 feet per imperial gallon of diesel oil  3.32m l or 41.2ft usgal   and that it has a passenger capacity of 1777  47  thus carrying 1777 passengers we can calculate an efficiency of 16.7 passenger miles per imperial gallon  16.9l 100pkm or 13.9pmpgus  
cruise ships edit 
msoasis of the seas has a capacity of 6,296 passengers and a fuel efficiency of 14.4 passenger miles per us gallon  voyager-class cruise ships have a capacity of 3,114 passengers and a fuel efficiency of 12.8 passenger miles per us gallon  48 
emma maersk edit 
emma maersk uses a wrtsil-sulzer rta96-c  which consumes 163g kwh and 13,000kg h  if it carries 13,000 containers then 1kg fuel transports one container for one hour over a distance of 45km  the ship takes 18 days from tanjung  singapore  to rotterdam  netherlands   11 from tanjung to suez  and 7 from suez to rotterdam  49  which is roughly 430 hours  and has 80mw   30mw  18 days at a mean speed of 25 knots  46km h  gives a total distance of 10,800 nautical miles  20,000km  
sailboats edit 
a sailboat  much like a solar car  can locomote without consuming any fuel  a sail boat such as a dinghy using just wind power requires no input energy in terms of fuel  however some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes  in addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion  such as cooking  heating or lighting  the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine  the speed at which it travels  and its displacement  due to the high viscosity of water  with a single passenger  the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car  train  or plane 
trains edit 
trains can be an efficient means of transport for freight and passengers  efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads  and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply  for electrified systems   50  51  and  importantly  end-to-end delivery  where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey 
actual consumption depends on gradients  maximum speeds  loading and stopping patterns  data produced for the european meet project  methodologies for estimating air pollutant emissions  illustrate the different consumption patterns over several track sections  the results show the consumption for a german ice high-speed train varied from around 19to 33kwh km  68119mj km  3153kwh mi   the data also reflects the weight of the train per passenger  for example  tgv double-deck duplex trains use lightweight materials  which keep axle loads down and reduce damage to track and also save energy  52

considering only the energy spent to move the train  and taking as example the urban area of lisbon  train seems to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobile for transportation of passengers  if we consider energy spent per passenger-km  64  considering an automobile which has a consumptions of around 6l 100km  47mpg-imp  39mpg-us  of gasoline  the fact the on average cars in europe have an occupation ratio of around 1.2 passengers per automobile and that one litre of gasoline amounts for about 8826 wh  one gets on average 441wh  1,590kj  per passenger-km  on the other hand  a modern urban train with an average occupation of 20  of total capacity  which has a consumption of about 8.5kwh km  31mj km  13.7kwh mi   one gets 21.5 wh per passenger-km  20 times less than the automobile 
braking losses edit 
stopping is a considerable source of inefficiency  modern electric trains like the shinkansen  the bullet train  use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake  a siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6  of the total energy consumed  the passenger rail  urban and intercity  and scheduled intercity and all charter bus industries technological and operational improvements  final report states that  commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops   and that  we estimate head-end power to be 35 percent  but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent  of total energy consumed by commuter railways   65  having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20  of the energy wasted in braking  weight is a determinant of braking losses

international transport comparisons edit 
uk public transport edit 
rail and bus are generally required to serve  off peak  and rural services  which by their nature have lower loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines  moreover  due to their  walk on  ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers  as a consequence  the overall load factor on uk railways is 35  or 90 people per train  71 
conversely  air services work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are  pre-book  in nature  using yield management overall loads can be raised to around 7090   however  recently intercity train operators have been using similar techniques  with loads reaching typically 71  overall for tgv services in france and a similar figure for the uk s virgin trains services  72

this computer tool devised by the ademe shows the importance of public transportation from an environmental point of view  it highlights the primary energy consumption as well as the co2 emissions due to transportation  however  nothing is said about the production of radioactive waste  moreover  intermodal passenger transport is probably a key to sustainable transport  by allowing people to use less polluting means of transportation
