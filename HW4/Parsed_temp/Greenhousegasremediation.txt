greenhouse gas removal projects are a type of climate engineering that seek to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere  and thus they tackle the root cause of global warming  these techniques either directly remove greenhouse gases  or alternatively seek to influence natural processes to remove greenhouse gases indirectly  the discipline overlaps with carbon capture and storage and carbon sequestration  and some projects listed may not be considered to be geoengineering by all commentators  instead being described as mitigation  1

carbon sequestration edit 
main articles  bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  carbon negative fuel  carbon sequestration  carbon dioxide removal  and carbon dioxide air capture
a wide range of techniques for carbon sequestration exist  these range from ideas to remove co2 from the atmosphere  carbon dioxide air capture   flue gases  carbon capture and storage  and by preventing carbon in biomass from re-entering the atmosphere  such as with bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  
chlorofluorocarbon photochemistry edit 
atmospheric chlorofluorocarbon  cfc  removal is an idea which suggests using lasers to break up cfcs  an important family of greenhouse gases  in the atmosphere  2 
methane removal edit 
methane potentially poses major challenges for remediation  it is around 20 times as powerful a greenhouse gas as co2  3  large quantities may be outgassed from permafrost and clathrates 4  as a result of global warming  notably in the arctic  5 
there are existing climate engineering proposals  6  7  methane is removed by several natural processes  which can be enhanced 
chemical decomposition  reaction with hydroxyl radicals produced from photochemical decomposition of ozone in the stratosphere 
biological decomposition  by methanotrophs in soils and water  8
