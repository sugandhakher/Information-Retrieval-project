process edit 
hydrogenation has three components  the unsaturated substrate  the hydrogen  or hydrogen source  and  invariably  a catalyst  the reduction reaction is carried out at different temperatures and pressures depending upon the substrate and the activity of the catalyst 
related or competing reactions edit 
hydrogenation reactions are accompanied by isomerization of the alkenes from cis to trans  this process is of great interest because hydrogenation technology generates most of the trans fat in foods  see below   a reaction where bonds are broken while hydrogen is added is called hydrogenolysis  a reaction that may occur to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom  oxygen  nitrogen or halogen  bonds  some hydrogenations of polar bonds are accompanied by hydrogenolysis 
hydrogen sources edit 
for hydrogenation  the obvious source of hydrogen is h2 gas itself  which is typically available commercially within the storage medium of a pressurized cylinder  the hydrogenation process often uses greater than 1 atmosphere of h2  usually conveyed from the cylinders and sometimes augmented by  booster pumps   gaseous hydrogen is produced industrially from hydrocarbons by the process known as steam reforming  2  for many applications  hydrogen is transferred from donor molecules such as formic acid  isopropanol  and dihydroanthracene  these hydrogen donors undergo dehydrogenation to  respectively  carbon dioxide  acetone  and anthracene  these processes are called transfer hydrogenations 
substrates edit 
an important characteristic of alkene and alkyne hydrogenations  both the homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed versions  is that hydrogen addition occurs with  syn addition   with hydrogen entering from the least hindered side  3  typical substrates are listed in the table

catalysts edit 
with rare exceptions  h2 is unreactive toward organic compounds in the absence of metal catalysts  the unsaturated substrate is chemisorbed onto the catalyst  with most sites covered by the substrate  in heterogeneous catalysts  hydrogen forms surface hydrides  m-h  from which hydrogens can be transferred to the chemisorbed substrate  platinum  palladium  rhodium  and ruthenium form highly active catalysts  which operate at lower temperatures and lower pressures of h2  non-precious metal catalysts  especially those based on nickel  such as raney nickel and urushibara nickel  have also been developed as economical alternatives  but they are often slower or require higher temperatures  the trade-off is activity  speed of reaction  vs  cost of the catalyst and cost of the apparatus required for use of high pressures  notice that the raney-nickel catalysed hydrogenations require high pressures  6  7 
catalysts are usually classified into two broad classes  homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts  homogeneous catalysts dissolve in the solvent that contains the unsaturated substrate  heterogeneous catalysts are solids that are suspended in the same solvent with the substrate or are treated with gaseous substrate 
homogeneous catalysts edit 
some well known homogeneous catalysts are indicated below  these are coordination complexes that activate both the unsaturated substrate and the h2  most typically  these complexes contain platinum group metals  especially rh and ir 
homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts and their precursors
dichlorotris triphenylphosphine ruthenium ii  is a precatalyst based on ruthenium 
crabtree s catalyst is a highly active catalyst featuring iridium 
rh2cl2 cod 2 is a precursor to many homogeneous catalysts 
 s -ipr-phox is a typical chelating phosphine ligand used in asymmetric hydrogenation 
hydrogenation of propylene with wilkinson s catalyst
homogeneous catalysts are also used in asymmetric synthesis by the hydrogenation of prochiral substrates  an early demonstration of this approach was the rh-catalyzed hydrogenation of enamides as precursors to the drug l-dopa  8  to achieve asymmetric reduction  these catalyst are made chiral by use of chiral diphosphine ligands  9  rhodium catalyzed hydrogenation has also been used in the herbicide production of s-metolachlor  which uses a josiphos type ligand  called xyliphos   10  in principle asymmetric hydrogenation can be catalyzed by chiral heterogeneous catalysts  11  but this approach remains more of a curiosity than a useful technology 
heterogeneous catalysts edit 
heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation are more common industrially  as in homogeneous catalysts  the activity is adjusted through changes in the environment around the metal  i e  the coordination sphere  different faces of a crystalline heterogeneous catalyst display distinct activities  for example  similarly  heterogeneous catalysts are affected by their supports  i e  the material upon with the heterogeneous catalyst is bound 
in many cases  highly empirical modifications involve selective  poisons   thus  a carefully chosen catalyst can be used to hydrogenate some functional groups without affecting others  such as the hydrogenation of alkenes without touching aromatic rings  or the selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes using lindlar s catalyst  for example  when the catalyst palladium is placed on barium sulfate and then treated with quinoline  the resulting catalyst reduces alkynes only as far as alkenes  the lindlar catalyst has been applied to the conversion of phenylacetylene to styrene  12

hydrogenation of an imine using a raney nickel catalyst  a popular heterogeneous catalyst 
partial hydrogenation of a resorcinol derivative using a raney-nickel catalyst 
hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid  14 
transfer hydrogenation edit 
hydrogen also can be extracted   transferred   from  hydrogen-donors  in place of h2 gas  hydrogen donors  which often serve as solvents include hydrazine  dihydronaphthalene  dihydroanthracene  isopropanol  and formic acid  15 
in organic synthesis  transfer hydrogenation is useful for the asymmetric reduction of polar unsaturated substrates  such as ketones  aldehydes  and imines  the hydrogenation of polar substrates such as ketones and aldehydes typically require transfer hydrogenation  at least in homogeneous catalysis  these catalysts are readily generated in chiral forms  which is the basis of asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones 
transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by transition metal complexes proceeds by an  outer sphere mechanism  
electrolytic hydrogenation edit 
polar substrates such as nitriles can be hydrogenated electrochemically  using protic solvents and reducing equivalents as the source of hydrogen  16 
thermodynamics and mechanism edit 
the addition of hydrogen to double or triple bonds in hydrocarbons is a type of redox reaction that can be thermodynamically favorable  for example  the addition of hydrogen to an alkene has a gibbs free energy change of -101 kjmol1  9  however  the reaction rate for most hydrogenation reactions is negligible in the absence of catalysts  hydrogenation is a strongly exothermic reaction  in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids  for example  the heat released is about 25 kcal per mole  105 kj mol   sufficient to raise the temperature of the oil by 1.61.7c per iodine number drop  the mechanism of metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes has been extensively studied  17  first of all isotope labeling using deuterium confirms the regiochemistry of the addition

heterogeneous catalysis edit 
on solids  the accepted mechanism is the horiuti-polanyi mechanism  18  19 
binding of the unsaturated bond  and hydrogen dissociation into atomic hydrogen onto the catalyst
addition of one atom of hydrogen  this step is reversible
addition of the second atom  effectively irreversible under hydrogenating conditions 
in the second step  the metallointermediate formed is a saturated compound that can rotate and then break down  again detaching the alkene from the catalyst  consequently  contact with a hydrogenation catalyst necessarily causes cis-trans-isomerization  because the isomerization is thermodynamically favorable  this is a problem in partial hydrogenation  while in complete hydrogenation the produced trans-alkene is eventually hydrogenated 
for aromatic substrates  the first bond is hardest to hydrogenate because of the free energy penalty for breaking the aromatic system  the product of this is a cyclohexadiene  which is extremely active and cannot be isolated  in conditions reducing enough to break the aromatization  it is immediately reduced to a cyclohexene  the cyclohexene is ordinarily reduced immediately to a fully saturated cyclohexane  but special modifications to the catalysts  such as the use of the anti-solvent water on ruthenium  can preserve some of the cyclohexene  if that is a desired product 
homogeneous catalysis edit 
in many homogeneous hydrogenation processes  20  the metal binds to both components to give an intermediate alkene-metal h 2 complex  the general sequence of reactions is assumed to be as follows or a related sequence of steps 
binding of the hydrogen to give a dihydride complex via oxidative addition  preceding the oxidative addition of h2 is the formation of a dihydrogen complex

the largest scale application of hydrogenation is for the processing of vegetable oils  2  typical vegetable oils are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids  containing more than one carbon-carbon double bond   their partial hydrogenation reduces most but not all  of these carbon-carbon double bonds  the degree of hydrogenation is controlled by restricting the amount of hydrogen  reaction temperature and time  and the catalyst  21 
partial hydrogenation of a typical plant oil to a typical component of margarine  most of the c c double bonds are removed in this process  which elevates the melting point of the product 
hydrogenation converts liquid vegetable oils into solid or semi-solid fats  such as those present in margarine  changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties  such as the melting range  which is why liquid oils become semi-solid  solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product  because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats  are available in a wide range of consistencies  and have other desirable characteristics  such as increased oxidative stability and longer shelf life   they are the predominant fats used as shortening in most commercial baked goods 
a side effect of incomplete hydrogenation having implications for human health is the isomerization of some of the remaining unsaturated carbon bonds  resulting in the trans isomers  which have been implicated in circulatory diseases including heart disease  22  the conversion from cis to trans bonds is favored because the trans configuration has lower energy than the natural cis one  at equilibrium  the trans cis isomer ratio is about 2 1  many countries and regions have introduced mandatory labeling of trans fats on food products and appealed to the industry for voluntary reductions  23  24  25 
petrochemical industry edit 
in petrochemical processes  hydrogenation is used to convert alkenes and aromatics into saturated alkanes  paraffins  and cycloalkanes  naphthenes   which are less toxic and less reactive  relevant to liquid fuels that are stored sometimes for long periods in air  saturated hydrocarbons exhibit superior storage properties  on the other hand  alkene tend to form hydroperoxides  which can form gums that interfere with fuel handing equipment  for example  mineral turpentine is usually hydrogenated  hydrocracking of heavy residues into diesel is another application  in isomerization and catalytic reforming processes  some hydrogen pressure is maintained to hydrogenolyze coke formed on the catalyst and prevent its accumulation 
organic chemistry edit 
hydrogenation is a useful means for converting unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives  substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes  but also aldehydes  imines  and nitriles  which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds  i e  alcohols and amines  thus  alkyl aldehydes  which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene  can be converted to alcohols  e g  1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde  produced from ethene and carbon monoxide  xylitol  a polyol  is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose  an aldehyde  primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles  while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile  for example  isophorone diamine  a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate  is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation reductive amination by ammonia  wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine

history edit 
heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation edit 
the earliest hydrogenation is that of platinum catalyzed addition of hydrogen to oxygen in the dbereiner s lamp  a device commercialized as early as 1823  the french chemist paul sabatier is considered the father of the hydrogenation process  in 1897  building on the earlier work of james boyce  an american chemist working in the manufacture of soap products  he discovered that traces of nickel catalyzed the addition of hydrogen to molecules of gaseous hydrocarbons in what is now known as the sabatier process  for this work  sabatier shared the 1912 nobel prize in chemistry  wilhelm normann was awarded a patent in germany in 1902 and in britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils  which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry  the commercially important haberbosch process  first described in 1905  involves hydrogenation of nitrogen  in the fischertropsch process  reported in 1922 carbon monoxide  which is easily derived from coal  is hydrogenated to liquid fuels 
in 1922  voorhees and adams described an apparatus for performing hydrogenation under pressures above one atmosphere  26  the parr shaker  the first product to allow hydrogenation using elevated pressures and temperatures  was commercialized in 1926 based on voorhees and adams  research and remains in widespread use  in 1924 murray raney developed a finely powdered form of nickel  which is widely used to catalyze hydrogenation reactions such as conversion of nitriles to amines or the production of margarine 
homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation edit 
in the 1930s  calvin discovered that copper ii  complexes oxidized h2  the 1960s witnessed the development of well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal complexes  e g   wilkinson s catalyst  rhcl pph3 3   soon thereafter cationic rh and ir were found catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyls  27  in the 1970s  asymmetric hydrogenation was demonstrated in the synthesis of l-dopa  and the 1990s saw the invention of noyori asymmetric hydrogenation  28  the development of homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the oxo process and zieglernatta polymerization 
metal-free hydrogenation edit 
for most practical purposes  hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst  hydrogenation can  however  proceed from some hydrogen donors without catalysts  illustrative hydrogen donors being diimide and aluminium isopropoxide  the latter illustrated by the meerweinponndorfverley reduction  some metal-free catalytic systems have been investigated in academic research  one such system for reduction of ketones consists of tert-butanol and potassium tert-butoxide and very high temperatures  29  the reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation of benzophenone 
a chemical kinetics study 30  found this reaction is first-order in all three reactants suggesting a cyclic 6-membered transition state 
another system for metal-free hydrogenation is based on the phosphine-borane  compound 1  which has been called a frustrated lewis pair  it reversibly accepts dihydrogen at relatively low temperatures to form the phosphonium borate 2 which can reduce simple hindered imines  31 
the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline has been reported to be catalysed by fullerene  its mono-anion  atmospheric hydrogen and uv light  32 
equipment used for hydrogenation edit 
today s bench chemist has three main choices of hydrogenation equipment 
batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions
batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and or pressure 33 
flow hydrogenation
batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions edit 
the original and still a commonly practised form of hydrogenation in teaching laboratories  this process is usually effected by adding solid catalyst to a round bottom flask of dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using nitrogen or argon gas and sealing the mixture with a penetrable rubber seal  hydrogen gas is then supplied from a h2-filled balloon  the resulting three phase mixture is agitated to promote mixing  hydrogen uptake can be monitored  which can be useful for monitoring progress of a hydrogenation  this is achieved by either using a graduated tube containing a coloured liquid  usually aqueous copper sulfate or with gauges for each reaction vessel 
batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and or pressure edit 
since many hydrogenation reactions such as hydrogenolysis of protecting groups and the reduction of aromatic systems proceed extremely sluggishly at atmospheric temperature and pressure  pressurised systems are popular  in these cases  catalyst is added to a solution of reactant under an inert atmosphere in a pressure vessel  hydrogen is added directly from a cylinder or built in laboratory hydrogen source  and the pressurized slurry is mechanically rocked to provide agitation  or a spinning basket is used  33  heat may also be used  as the pressure compensates for the associated reduction in gas solubility 
flow hydrogenation edit 
flow hydrogenation has become a popular technique at the bench and increasingly the process scale  this technique involves continuously flowing a dilute stream of dissolved reactant over a fixed bed catalyst in the presence of hydrogen  using established hplc technology  this technique allows the application of pressures from atmospheric to 1,450psi  100bar   elevated temperatures may also be used  at the bench scale  systems use a range of pre-packed catalysts which eliminates the need for weighing and filtering pyrophoric catalysts 
industrial reactors edit 
catalytic hydrogenation is done in a tubular plug-flow reactor  pfr  packed with a supported catalyst  the pressures and temperatures are typically high  although this depends on the catalyst  catalyst loading is typically much lower than in laboratory batch hydrogenation  and various promoters are added to the metal  or mixed metals are used  to improve activity  selectivity and catalyst stability  the use of nickel is common despite its low activity  due to its low cost compared to precious metals 
gas liquid induction reactors  hydrogenator  are also used for carrying out catalytic hydrogenation  34
