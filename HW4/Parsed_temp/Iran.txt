medieval period
main articles  muslim conquest of persia and medieval iran
the prolonged byzantine-sassanid wars  most importantly the climactic byzantine-sassanid war of 602-628  as well as the social conflict within the sassanid empire  opened the way for an arab invasion to iran in the 7th century  79  80  initially defeated by the arab rashidun caliphate  iran came under the rule of the arab caliphates of umayyad and abbasid  the prolonged and gradual process of the islamization of iran began following the conquest  under the new arab elite of the rashidun and later the umayyad caliphates  both converted  mawali  and non-converted  dhimmi  iranians were discriminated against  being excluded from the government and military  and having to pay a special tax called jizya  81  82  gunde shapur  home of the academy of gunde shapur which was the most important medical center of the world at the time  survived after the invasion  but became known as an islamic institute thereafter  83 
tomb of hafez  the popular iranian poet whose works are regarded as a pinnacle in persian literature and have left a considerable mark on later western writers  most notably goethe  thoreau and emerson  84  85  86 
in 750  the abbasids overthrew the umayyads  due mainly to the support from the mawali iranians  87  the mawali formed the majority of the rebel army  which was led by the iranian general abu muslim  88  89  90  the arrival of the abbasid caliphs saw a revival of iranian culture and influence  and a move away from the imposed arabic customs  the role of the old arab aristocracy was gradually replaced by an iranian bureaucracy  91 
after two centuries of the arab rule  semi-independent and independent iranian kingdoms such as the tahirids  saffarids  samanids  and buyids began to appear on the fringes of the declining abbasid caliphate  by the samanid era in the 9th and 10th centuries  the efforts of iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified  92 
the blossoming literature  philosophy  medicine  and art of iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the iranian civilization  during the period known as the islamic golden age  93  94  the islamic golden age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries  during which iran was the main theater of the scientific activities  83  after the 10th century  the persian language  alongside arabic  was used for the scientific  philosophical  historical  musical  and medical works  whereas the important iranian writers  such as tusi  avicenna  qotb od din shirazi  and biruni  had major contributions in the scientific writing 
the cultural revival that began in the abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the iranian national identity  and so earlier attempts of arabization never succeeded in iran  the iranian shuubiyah movement became a catalyst for iranians to regain independence in their relations with the arab invaders  95  the most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the persian language attested to the epic poet ferdowsi  now regarded as the most important figure in iranian literature 
turul tower  a 12th-century monument in rey  iran 
the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau  96  turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks  slave-warriors   replacing iranian and arab elements within the army  88  as a result  the mamluks gained a significant political power  in 999  large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids  whose rulers were of mamluk turk origin  and longer subsequently under the turkish seljuk and khwarezmian empires  these turks had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership  96  the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia  while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them  97  98  the result of the adoption and patronage of persian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition 
in 121921 the khwarezmian empire suffered a devastating invasion by the mongol army of genghis khan  according to steven r  ward   mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the iranian plateau  possibly 10 to 15 million people  some historians have estimated that iran s population did not again reach its pre-mongol levels until the mid-20th century   99 
following the fracture of the mongol empire in 1256  hulagu khan  grandson of genghis khan  established the ilkhanate in iran  in 1370  yet another conqueror  timur  followed the example of hulagu  establishing the timurid empire which lasted for another 156 years  in 1387  timur ordered the complete massacre of isfahan  reportedly killing 70,000 citizens  100  the ilkhans and the timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the iranians  choosing to surround themselves with a culture that was distinctively iranian  101

a venetian portrait of ismail i  the founder of the safavid dynasty   the uffizi
by the 1500s  ismail i from ardabil  established the safavid dynasty  with tabriz as the capital  96  beginning with azerbaijan  he subsequently extended his authority over all of the iranian territories  and established an intermittent iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions  reasserting the iranian identity within large parts of the greater iran  102  iran was predominantly sunni  103  but ismail instigated a forced conversion to the shia branch of islam  104  by which the shia islam spread throughout the safavid territories in the caucasus  iran  anatolia  and mesopotamia  as a result  thereof  the modern-day iran is the only official shia nation of the world  with it holding an absolute majority in iran and the republic of azerbaijan  having there the 1st and 2nd highest number of shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world  105  106 
the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between safavid iran and the neighboring ottoman empire  led to numerous ottomanpersian wars  99  the safavid era peaked in the reign of abbas the great  15871629  99  107  surpassing their ottoman archrivals in strength  and making the empire a leading hub in western eurasia for the sciences and arts  the safavid era saw the start of mass integration from caucasian populations into new layers of the society of iran  as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of iran  playing a pivotal role in the history of iran for centuries onwards  following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s  which was caused by the internal conflicts  the continuous wars with the ottomans  and the foreign interference  most notably the russian interference   the safavid rule was ended by the pashtun rebels who besieged isfahan and defeated soltan hosein in 1722

in 1729  nader shah  a chieftain and military genius from khorasan  successfully drove out and conquered the pashtun invaders  he subsequently took back the annexed caucasian territories which were divided among the ottoman and russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in iran  during the reign of nader shah  iran reached its greatest extent since the sassanid empire  reestablishing the iranian hegemony all over the caucasus  as well as other major parts of the west and central asia  and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time  24 
nader shah invaded india and sacked far off delhi by the late 1730s  his territorial expansion  as well as his military successes  went into a decline following the final campaigns in the northern caucasus  the assassination of nader shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil  after which karim khan of the zand dynasty came to power in 1750  bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity  99 
the geopolitical reach of the zand dynasty was limited  compared to its preceding dynasties  many of the iranian territories in the caucasus gained de facto independence and were locally ruled through various caucasian khanates  however  despite the self-ruling  they all remained subjects and vassals to the zand king  108  the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west  109

another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779  out of which aqa mohammad khan emerged  founding the qajar dynasty in 1794  in 1795  following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians  the qajars captured tblisi by the battle of krtsanisi  and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus  reestablishing a short-lived iranian suzerainty over the region  the russo-persian wars of 18041813 and 18261828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for iran in the caucasus  comprising all of transcaucasia and dagestan  which made part of the very concept of iran for centuries  25  and thus substantial gains for the neighboring russian empire 
as a result of the 19th century russo-persian wars  the russians took over the caucasus  and iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region  comprising modern-day dagestan  georgia  armenia  and azerbaijan   which got confirmed per the treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay  26  110  the area to the north of the river aras  among which the contemporary republic of azerbaijan  eastern georgia  dagestan  and armenia  were iranian territory until they were occupied by russia in the course of the 19th century  26  111  112  113  114  115  116

notable minority languages in iran include armenian  georgian  neo-aramaic  and arabic  khuzi arabic is spoken by the arabs in khuzestan  and the wider group of iranian arabs  circassian was also once widely used by the large circassian minority  but  due to assimilation over the many years  no sizable number of circassians speak the language anymore  285  286  287  288

ethnic groups
main article  ethnicities in iran

ethnicities and religions in iran 
other non-governmental estimations regarding the groups other than the persians and azerbaijanis roughly congruate with the world factbook and the library of congress  however  many scholarly and organisational estimations regarding the number of these two groups differ significantly from the mentioned census  according to many of them  the number of ethnic azerbaijanis in iran comprises between 21.630  of the total population  with the majority holding it on 25  c 292 d 293  294  295  296  297  in any case  the largest population of azerbaijanis in the world live in iran
