a department for environment  food and rural affairs energy crops scheme plantation in the united kingdom  energy crops of this sort can be used in conventional power stations or specialised electricity generation units  reducing the amount of fossil fuel-derived carbon dioxide emissions 
an energy crop is a plant grown as a low-cost and low-maintenance harvest used to make biofuels  such as bioethanol  or combusted for its energy content to generate electricity or heat  energy crops are generally categorized as woody or herbaceous plants  many of the latter are grasses  graminaceae  
commercial energy crops are typically densely planted  high-yielding crop species  processed to bio-fuel and burnt to generate power  woody crops such as willow 1  or poplar are widely utilised  as well as temperate grasses such as miscanthus and pennisetum purpureum  both known as elephant grass   2  if carbohydrate content is desired for the production of biogas  whole-crops such as maize  sudan grass  millet  white sweet clover and many others  can be made into silage and then converted into biogas  3 
through genetic modification and application of biotechnology plants can be manipulated to create greater yields  reduce associated costs and require less water  however  high energy yield can be realized with existing cultivars  3  250

types of energy crops edit 
by state edit 
solid biomass edit 
elephant grass  miscanthus sinensis  is an experimental energy crop
 note  the terms biofuel  biomass  and so on  are often used interchangeably  
energy generated by burning plants grown for the purpose  often after the dry matter is pelletized  energy crops are used for firing power plants  either alone or co-fired with other fuels  alternatively they may be used for heat or combined heat and power  chp  production 
to cover the increasing requirements of woody biomass  short rotation coppice  src  were applied to agricultural sites  within this cropping systems fast growing tree species like willows and poplars are planted in growing cycles of three to five years  the cultivation of this cultures is dependent on wet soil conditions and could be an alternative for moist field sieds  however  an influence on local water conditions could not be excluded  this indicates that an establishment should exclude the vicinity to vulnarable wetland ecosystems  4  5 
gas biomass  methane  edit 
anaerobic digesters or biogas plants can be directly supplemented with energy crops once they have been ensiled into silage  the fastest growing sector of german biofarming has been in the area of  renewable energy crops  on nearly 500,000ha  1,200,000 acres  of land  2006   6  energy crops can also be grown to boost gas yields where feedstocks have a low energy content  such as manures and spoiled grain  it is estimated that the energy yield presently of bioenergy crops converted via silage to methane is about 2gwh km2  1.81010btu sqmi   small mixed cropping enterprises with animals can use a portion of their acreage to grow and convert energy crops and sustain the entire farms energy requirements with about 1/5 the acreage  in europe and especially germany  however  this rapid growth has occurred only with substantial government support  as in the german bonus system for renewable energy  similar developments of integrating crop farming and bioenergy production via silage-methane have been almost entirely overlooked in n  america  where political and structural issues and a huge continued push to centralize energy production has overshadowed positive developments  citation needed 
liquid biomass edit 
biodiesel edit 
coconuts sun-dried in kozhikode  kerala for making copra  the dried meat  or kernel  of the coconut  coconut oil extracted from it has made copra an important agricultural commodity for many coconut-producing countries  it also yields coconut cake which is mainly used as feed for livestock 
pure biodiesel  b-100   made from soybeans
european production of biodiesel from energy crops has grown steadily in the last decade  principally focused on rapeseed used for oil and energy  production of oil biodiesel from rape covers more than 12,000km in germany alone  and has doubled in the past 15 years  7  typical yield of oil as pure biodiesel may be is 100,000l km2  68,000usgal sqmi  57,000impgal sqmi  or more  making biodiesel crops economically attractive  provided sustainable crop rotations exist that are nutrient-balanced and preventative of the spread of disease such as clubroot  biodiesel yield of soybeans is significantly lower than that of rape  citation needed

bioethanol edit 
energy crops for biobutanol are grasses  two leading non-food crops for the production of cellulosic bioethanol are switchgrass and giant miscanthus  there has been a preoccupation with cellulosic bioethanol in america as the agricultural structure supporting biomethane is absent in many regions  with no credits or bonus system in place  citation needed  consequently  a lot of private money and investor hopes are being pinned on marketable and patentable innovations in enzyme hydrolysis and the like 
bioethanol also refers to the technology of using principally corn  maize seed  to make ethanol directly through fermentation  a process that under certain field and process conditions can consume as much energy as is the energy value of the ethanol it produces  therefore being non-sustainable  new developments in converting grain stillage  referred to as distillers grain stillage or dgs  into biogas energy looks promising as a means to improve the poor energy ratio of this type of bioethanol process 
by dedication edit 
main article  food vs fuel
dedicated energy crops are non-food energy crops as giant miscanthus  switchgrass  jatropha  fungi  and algae  dedicated energy crops are promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions of the united states  8 
additionally  byproducts  green waste  of food and non-food energy crops can be used to produce various biofuels
