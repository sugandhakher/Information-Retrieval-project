kelvin wake pattern generated by a small boat 
in fluid dynamics  a wake may either be 
the region of recirculating flow immediately behind a moving or stationary blunt body  caused by viscosity  which may be accompanied by flow separation and turbulence  or
the wave pattern on the water surface downstream of an object in a flow  or produced by a moving object  e g  a ship   caused by pressure differences of the fluids above and below the free surface and gravity  or surface tension   or both

wake effects caused by viscosity edit 
visualisation of the krmn vortex street in the wake behind a circular cylinder in air  the flow is made visible through release of oil vapour in the air near the cylinder 
the wake is the region of disturbed flow  often turbulent  downstream of a solid body moving through a fluid  caused by the flow of the fluid around the body 
for a blunt body in subsonic external flow  for example the apollo or orion capsules during descent and landing  the wake is massively separated and behind the body is a reverse flow region where the flow is moving toward the body  this phenomenon is often observed in wind tunnel testing of aircraft  and is especially important when parachute systems are involved  because unless the parachute lines extend the canopy beyond the reverse flow region  the chute can fail to inflate and thus collapse  parachutes deployed into wakes suffer dynamic pressure deficits which reduce their expected drag forces  high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations are often undertaken to model wake flows  although such modeling has uncertainties associated with turbulence modeling  for example rans versus les implementations   in addition to unsteady flow effects  example applications include rocket stage separation and aircraft store separation 
waves by density differences  like a water surface edit 
in incompressible fluids  liquids  such as water  a bow wake is created when a watercraft moves through the medium  as the medium cannot be compressed  it must be displaced instead  resulting in a wave  as with all wave forms  it spreads outward from the source until its energy is overcome or lost  usually by friction or dispersion

kelvin wake pattern edit 
waterfowl and boats moving across the surface of water produce a wake pattern  first explained mathematically by lord kelvin and known today as the kelvin wake pattern  1 
this pattern consists of two wake lines that form the arms of a chevron  v  with the source of the wake at the vertex of the v  for sufficiently slow motion  each wake line is offset from the path of the wake source by around arcsin 1/3    19.47 and is made up of feathery wavelets angled at roughly 53 to the path 
the inside of the v  of total opening 39 as indicated above  is filled with transverse curved waves  each of which is an arc of a circle centered at a point lying on the path at a distance twice that of the arc to the wake source  this pattern is independent of the speed and size of the wake source over a significant range of values  2 
however  the pattern changes at high speeds  only   viz   above a hull froude number of approximately 0.5  then  as the source s speed increases  the transverse waves diminish and the points of maximum amplitude on the wavelets form a second v within the wake pattern  which grows narrower with the increased speed of the source  3 
the angles in this pattern are not intrinsic properties of merely water  any isentropic and incompressible liquid with low viscosity will exhibit the same phenomenon  furthermore  this phenomenon has nothing to do with turbulence  everything discussed here is based on the linear theory of an ideal fluid  cf  airy wave theory 
parts of the pattern may be obscured by the effects of propeller wash  and tail eddies behind the boat s stern  and by the boat being a large object and not a point source  the water need not be stationary  but may be moving as in a large river  and the important consideration then is the velocity of the water relative to a boat or other object causing a wake 
this pattern follows from the dispersion relation of deep water waves  which is often written as 
 
 
g
k
 
  displaystyle  omega    sqrt  gk    
where
g   the strength of the gravity field
 is the angular frequency in radians per second
k   angular wavenumber in radians per metre
 deep  means that the depth is greater than half of the wavelength  this formula implies that the group velocity of a deep water wave is half of its phase velocity  which  in turn  goes as the square root of the wavelength  two velocity parameters of importance for the wake pattern are 
v is the relative velocity of the water and the surface object that causes the wake 
c is the phase velocity of a wave  varying with wave frequency 
as the surface object moves  it continuously generates small disturbances which are the sum of sinusoidal waves with a wide spectrum of wavelengths  those waves with the longest wavelengths have phase speeds above v and dissipate into the surrounding water and are not easily observed  other waves with phase speeds at or below v  however  are amplified through constructive interference and form visible shock waves  stationary in position w r t  the boat 
classic duck wake
the angle  between the phase shock wave front and the path of the object is    arcsin c v   if c v   1 or   1  no later waves can catch up with earlier waves and no shockwave forms 
in deep water  shock waves form even from slow-moving sources  because waves with short enough wavelengths move slower  these shock waves are at sharper angles than one would naively expect  because it is group velocity that dictates the area of constructive interference and  in deep water  the group velocity is half of the phase velocity 
all shock waves  that each by itself would have had an angle between 33 and 72  are compressed into a narrow band of wake with angles between 15 and 19  with the strongest constructive interference at the outer edge  angle arcsin 1/3    19.47   placing the two arms of the v in the celebrated kelvin wake pattern 
a concise geometric construction 4  demonstrates that  strikingly  this group shock angle w r t  the path of the boat  19.47  for any and all of the above   is actually independent of v  c  and g  it merely relies on the fact that the group velocity is half of the phase velocity c  on any planet  slow-swimming objects have  effective mach number  3 
concise argument for the universal opening of 39 of the slow-swimmers  kelvin wake
envelope of the disturbance emitted at successive times  fig 12.3 p 410 of g b  whitham  1974  linear and nonlinear waves  the circles represent wavefronts 
for slow swimmers  low froude number  the lighthillwhitham geometric argument that the opening of the kelvin chevron  wedge  v pattern  is universal goes as follows  consider a boat moving from right to left with constant speed v  emitting waves of varying wavelength  and thus wavenumber k and phase velocity c k   of interest when   v for a shock wave  cf   e g   sonic boom or cherenkov radiation   equivalently  and more intuitively  fix the position of the boat and have the water flow in the opposite direction  like a piling in a river 
focus first on a given k  emitting  phase  wavefronts whose stationary position w r t  the boat assemble to the standard shock wedge tangent to all of them  cf  fig 12.3 
as indicated above  the openings of these chevrons vary with wavenumber  the angle  between the phase shock wavefront and the path of the boat  the water  being    arcsin c v    2    evidently   increases with k  however  these phase chevrons are not visible  it is their corresponding group wave manifestations which are observed 
envelope of the disturbance emitted at successive times  fig 12.2 p 409 of g b  whitham  1974  linear and nonlinear waves  here  is the angle between the path of the wave source and the direction of wave propagation  the wave vector k   and the circles represent wavefronts 
consider one of the phase circles of fig 12.3 for a particular k  corresponding to the time t in the past  fig 12.2  its radius is qs  and the phase chevron side is the tangent ps to it  evidently  pq  vt and sq   ct   vt cos  as the right angle psq places s on the semicircle of diameter pq 
since the group velocity is half the phase velocity for any and all k  however  the visible  group  disturbance point corresponding to s will be t  the midpoint of sq  similarly  it lies on a semicircle now centered on r  where  manifestly  rq pq 4  an effective group wavefront emitted from r  with radius vt 4 now 
significantly  the resulting wavefront angle with the boat s path  the angle of the tangent from p to this smaller circle  obviously has a sine of tr pr 1/3  for any and all k  c    g  etc  strikingly  virtually all parameters of the problem have dropped out  except for the deep-water group-to-phase-velocity relation  note the  highly notional  effective group disturbance emitter moves slower  at 3v 4 
thus  summing over all relevant k and ts to flesh out an effective fig 12.3 shock pattern  the universal kelvin wake pattern arises  the full visible chevron angle is twice that  2arcsin 1/3   39 
the wavefronts of the wavelets in the wake are at 53  which is roughly the average of 33 and 72  the wave components with would-be shock wave angles between 73 and 90 dominate the interior of the v  they end up half-way between the point of generation and the current location of the wake source  this explains the curvature of the arcs 
those very short waves with would-be shock wave angles below 33 lack a mechanism to reinforce their amplitudes through constructive interference and are usually seen as small ripples on top of the interior transverse waves

other effects edit 
the above describes an ideal wake  where the body s means of propulsion has no other effect on the water  in practice the wave pattern between the v-shaped wavefronts is usually mixed with the effects of propeller backwash and eddying behind the boat s  usually square-ended  stern 
recreation edit 
 no wake zones  may prohibit wakes in marinas  near moorings and within some distance of shore 5  in order to facilitate recreation by other boats and reduce the damage wakes cause  powered narrowboats on british canals are not permitted to create a breaking wash  a wake large enough to create a breaking wave  along the banks  as this erodes them  this rule normally restricts these vessels to 4 statute miles per hour or less 
wakes are occasionally used recreationally  swimmers  people riding personal watercraft  and aquatic mammals such as dolphins can ride the leading edge of a wake  in the sport of wakeboarding the wake is used as a jump  the wake is also used to propel a surfer in the sport of wakesurfing  in the sport of water polo  the ball carrier can swim while advancing the ball  propelled ahead with the wake created by alternating armstrokes in crawl stroke  a technique known as dribbling
