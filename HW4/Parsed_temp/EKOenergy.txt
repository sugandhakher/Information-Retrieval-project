governance edit 
every member organization  all not-for-profit organisations  appoints one person to the ekoenergy board  the networks highest governing authority  the board takes decisions in consultation with the advisory group  which consist of experts from different stakeholder groups  including electricity industry  consumers and environmentalists  among others  4

criteria of the ecolabel edit 
only electricity from renewable sources can be sold as ekoenergy  but ekoenergy is more than just green electricity  ekoenergy also sets criteria for the following aspects  8 
consumer information  consumers get information about where and how the electricity has been produced 
sustainability  ekoenergy takes into account the impacts of electricity production on ecosystem services  habitats and the biodiversity of species  firstly  it does this by excluding the most environmentally degrading and problematic electricity production methods  secondly  it finances river restoration through an environmental fund 
climate  per every mwh sold  minimum 10 euro cents will be paid into the ekoenergy climate fund 
tracking of the electricity  the criteria are based on the european best practice  and on the recommendations of re-diss eped 
auditing and verification  all ekoenergy claims are verified by independent auditors 
users of the label edit

ekoenergy mentioned in other environmental standards edit 
leed edit 
the european versions of the leed standard explicitly recommend the use of ekoenergy labelled electricity  24  buildings aiming at leed certification can get extra points if the electricity used in that building is ekoenergy certified  the text leed 2009 bd c supplemental reference guide with alternative compliance paths for europe 25  gives ekoenergy the same status as green-e certified recs in the us  they write   the ekoenergy electricity certification scheme represents the best available pan-european option for the sustainable and additional consumption of renewable electricity within europe  ekoenergy certifies renewable electricity that goes beyond the regulations of european directives and national governments of europe  
greenhouse gas protocol edit 
the greenhouse gas protocol is a worldwide standard for carbon accounting  it is a joint product of the world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development  in january 2015  the secretariat of the greenhouse gas protocol published the scope 2 guidance  which gave advice about carbon accounting  the guidance refers to ekoenergy several times  chapter 11  which encourages companies to go one step further  refers to ekoenergys climate fund  26  27 
cdp edit 
cdp works with 5000 of the largest corporations in the world to help them calculate their carbon emissions and to help them develop effective carbon emission reduction strategies  on page 15 and 16 of its technical notes for accounting of scope 2 emissions  i e  emissions related to the production of purchased electricity   cdp explains how companies can do more  ecolabels are a way for companies to do more with their purchases  ekoenergy  mentioned by the ghg protocol scope 2 guidance  is such an option  it is a mark of quality which comes on top of tracking certificates  electricity sold with the ekoenergy label fulfills strict environmental criteria and raises funds for new renewable energy projects  involvement  transparency and deeds not words are important principles of ekoenergys work  28
