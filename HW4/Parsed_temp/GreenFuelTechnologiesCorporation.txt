greenfuel technologies corporation  gft  was a startup that developed a process of growing algae using emissions from fossil fuel  mainly to produce biofuel from algae 
it was based in cambridge  massachusetts  greenfuel shut down operations on may 13  2009 1  2  after having raised more than  70 million in investments  citing it had run out of funds  and a victim of the economy

history edit 
the gft president  chief technology officer and the inventor of a newly patented system for growing pollution-digesting algae inexpensively on an industrial scale is isaac berzin  who founded the company in april  2001  time magazine included berzin in its list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008  3 
a beta emission reduction system was installed at an mit cogeneration facility in 2004 and after performing beyond expectations was moved to a larger power plant in fall 2005  pilot units were tested at power plants in arizona  massachusetts and new york  although the algal biomass produced by the process consists of proteins  lipids and carbohydrates which could be used to produce a variety of products  gft seems to be focusing on biofuel products  greenfuel s large scale algae to biofuel process at the arizona public service redhawk power facility won the 2006 platts emissions energy project of the year award  4 
in november 2006 arizona public service company  aps  announced that it and its partner greenfuel technologies will attempt to replicate their success of creating biofuels from algae grown using carbon dioxide  co2  emissions from a power plant  5 
in 2007  the company had to shut down its third-generation bioreactor facility in arizona after the plant produced more algae than the companys equipment could handle  at the same time  the company learned that its algae harvesting system would cost twice as much as expected  in 2007 they announced a restructuring  some 25 employees  about half the companys staff  were laid off as a result of the plant shutdown

known as emissions-to-biofuels  the process could use a photosynthetic bioreactor supplied with exhaust gases from a fossil fuel combustion source to grow algae  as smokestack emissions are delivered to the algae bioreactor  carbon dioxide and other pollutants are absorbed and utilized by the algae to grow at an exponential rate  once harvested  the algae is processed to produce a variety of solids such as protein and bioplastics  gases such as methane  and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel 
application edit 
sources of carbon rich exhaust include manufacturing facilities and electricity generation plants  especially those which burn coal  once the algal biomass is harvested and processed  the resulting fuel may be sold for additional revenue or utilized on-site 
benefits edit 
the biofuel yield using the greenfuel technique is 30 times higher per hectare compared to the yield of oil derived from conventional terrestrial crops  emissions of carbon dioxide are reduced by 40  and emissions of oxides of nitrogen are reduced by up to 85   plant retrofits can be made with minimal disruption to existing facilities 
large-scale algae farming plants edit 
greenfuel technologies had launched the second phase of a major project with spanish renewable energy firm aurantia  6  to build a large-scale algae farming plant adjacent to a co2-spewing cement plant near jerez  spain
