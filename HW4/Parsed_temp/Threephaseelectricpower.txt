three-phase transformer with four wire output for 208y 120 volt service  one wire for neutral  others for a  b and c phases
three-phase electric power is a common method of alternating-current electric power generation  transmission  and distribution  1  it is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power  it is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads 
a three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent single-phase at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit electrical power  2  the three-phase system was independently invented by galileo ferraris  mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky  jonas wenstrm and nikola tesla in the late 1880s

principle edit 
normalized waveforms of the instantaneous voltages in a three-phase system in one cycle with time increasing to the right  the phase order is 123  this cycle repeats with the frequency of the power system 
three-phase electric power transmission lines
three phase transformer  bkscsaba  hungary   on the left are the primary wires and on the right are the secondary wires
in a symmetric three-phase power supply system  three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third the period  the common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current-carrying conductor called the neutral  due to the phase difference  the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle after one of the other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor  this phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load  it also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers  for instance  a two phase system using a scott-t transformer  
the symmetric threephase systems described here are simply referred to as threephase systems because  although it is possible to design and implement asymmetric threephase power systems  i e   with unequal voltages or phase shifts   they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems 
in a threephase system feeding a balanced and linear load  the sum of the instantaneous currents of the three conductors is zero  in other words  the current in each conductor is equal in magnitude to the sum of the currents in the other two  but with the opposite sign  the return path for the current in any phase conductor is the other two phase conductors 
advantages edit 
as compared to a single-phase ac power supply that uses two conductors  phase and neutral   a three-phase supply with no neutral and the same phase-to-ground voltage and current capacity per phase can transmit three times as much power using just 1.5 times as many wires  i e   three instead of two   thus  the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled  the same ratio of capacity to conductor material can also be attained with a center-grounded single-phase system  3 
three-phase systems may also utilize a fourth wire  particularly in low-voltage distribution  this is the neutral wire  the neutral allows three separate single-phase supplies to be provided at a constant voltage and is commonly used for supplying groups of domestic properties which are each single-phase loads  the connections are arranged so that  as far as possible in each group  equal power is drawn from each phase  further up the distribution system  the currents are usually well balanced  transformers may be wired in a way that they have a fourwire secondary but a threewire primary while allowing unbalanced loads and the associated secondaryside neutral currents 
three-phase supplies have properties that make them very desirable in electric power distribution systems 
the phase currents tend to cancel out one another  summing to zero in the case of a linear balanced load  this makes it possible to reduce the size of the neutral conductor because it carries little or no current  with a balanced load  all the phase conductors carry the same current and so can be the same size 
power transfer into a linear balanced load is constant  which helps to reduce generator and motor vibrations 
three-phase systems can produce a rotating magnetic field with a specified direction and constant magnitude  which simplifies the design of electric motors 
most household loads are single-phase  in north american residences  three-phase power might feed a multiple-unit apartment block  but the household loads are connected only as single phase  in lower-density areas  only a single phase might be used for distribution  some high-power domestic appliances such as electric stoves and clothes dryers are powered by two or three phases instead of one in order to use lower currents  so households with such appliances must be provided with more than one phase 
phase sequence edit 
wiring for the three phases is typically identified by color codes which vary by country  connection of the phases in the right order is required to ensure the intended direction of rotation of three-phase motors  for example  pumps and fans may not work in reverse  maintaining the identity of phases is required if there is any possibility two sources can be connected at the same time  a direct interconnection between two different phases is a short-circuit

at the power station  an electrical generator converts mechanical power into a set of three ac electric currents  one from each coil  or winding  of the generator  the windings are arranged such that the currents vary sinusoidally at the same frequency but with the peaks and troughs of their wave forms offset to provide three complementary currents with a phase separation of one-third cycle  120 or 23 radians   the generator frequency is typically 50 or 60 hz  depending on the country 
at the power station  transformers change the voltage from generators to a level suitable for transmission in order to minimize losses 
after further voltage conversions in the transmission network  the voltage is finally transformed to the standard utilization before power is supplied to customers 
most automotive alternators generate three phase ac and rectify it to dc with a diode bridge  6 
transformer connections edit 
a  delta  connected transformer winding is connected between phases of a three-phase system  a  wye  transformer connects each winding from a phase wire to a common neutral point 
in an  open delta  or  v  system  only two transformers are used  a closed delta system can operate as an open delta if one of the transformers has failed or needs to be removed  7  in open delta  each transformer must carry current for its respective phases as well as current for the third phase  therefore capacity is reduced to 87   with one of three transformers missing and the remaining two at 87  efficiency  the capacity is 58    2/3   87    8  9 
where a delta-fed system must be grounded for detection of stray current to ground or protection from surge voltages  a grounding transformer  usually a zigzag transformer  may be connected to allow ground fault currents to return from any phase to ground  another variation is a  corner grounded  delta system  which is a closed delta that is grounded at one of the junctions of transformers  10 
three-wire and four-wire circuits edit 
wye  y  and delta    circuits
there are two basic three-phase configurations  wye  y  and delta     as shown in the diagram  a delta configuration requires only 3 wires for transmission but a wye  star  configuration may utilise a fourth wire  the fourth wire  if present  is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded  the  3-wire  and  4-wire  designations do not count the ground wire used above many transmission lines  which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under non-fault conditions 
a four-wire system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the neutral is connected to the  common star point  of all supply windings  in such a system  all three phases will have the same magnitude of voltage relative to the neutral  other non-symmetrical systems have been used 
the four-wire wye system is used when ground referenced voltages or the flexibility of more voltage selections are required  faults on one phase to ground will cause a protection event  fuse or breaker open  locally and not involve other phases or other connected equipment  citation needed  an example of application is local distribution in europe  and elsewhere   where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral  which is common to the three phases   when a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents  the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances  electrical engineers try to design the system so the loads are balanced as much as possible within premises where 3-phase power is utilized  11  these same principles apply to the wide scale distribution of power to individual premises  hence  every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute all three phases over a large number of premises so that  on average  as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply 
for domestic use  some countries such as the uk may supply one phase and neutral at a high current  up to 100a  to one property  while others such as germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer  but at a lower fuse rating  typically 32 a per phase  and  shuffled  to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase  citation needed 
a transformer for a  high-leg delta  system  assuming a 200 v  3-phase supply  200 v 3-phase motors would be connected to l1  l2 and l3  200 v single-phase load would be connected between l1 and l2  single-phase 100 v supplies  180 degrees  out of phase   would be obtained between either l1 or l2 and the neutral  n   l3  wild or high leg  will be 173.2 v with respect to the neutral 
in north america  a high-leg delta supply is sometimes used where one winding of a delta-connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral as shown in the second diagram  this setup produces three different voltages  if the voltage between the center tap  neutral  and each of the two adjacent phases is 120 v  100    the voltage across any two phases is 240 v  200    and the neutral to  high leg  voltage is  208 v  173    7 
the reason for providing the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field  however  the premises concerned will also require the  normal  north american 120 v supplies  two of which are derived  180 degrees  out of phase   between the  neutral  and either of the center tapped phase points 
balanced circuits edit 
in the perfectly balanced case all three lines share equivalent loads  examining the circuits we can derive relationships between line voltage and current  and load voltage and current for wye and delta connected loads 
in a balanced system each line will produce equal voltage magnitudes at phase angles equally spaced from each other  with v1 as our reference and v3 lagging v2 lagging v1  using angle notation  we have  12

single-phase loads edit 
single-phase loads may be connected across any two phases  or a load can be connected from phase to neutral  13  distributing single-phase loads among the phases of a three-phase system balances the load and makes most economical use of conductors and transformers 
in a symmetrical three-phase four-wire  wye system  the three phase conductors have the same voltage to the system neutral  the voltage between line conductors is 3 times the phase conductor to neutral voltage  14

the currents returning from the customers  premises to the supply transformer all share the neutral wire  if the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases  the sum of the returning currents in the neutral wire is approximately zero  any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently 
if the supply neutral is broken  phase-to-neutral voltage is no longer maintained  phases with higher relative loading will experience reduced voltage  and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage  up to the phase-to-phase voltage 
a high-leg delta provides phase-to-neutral relationship of vll   2vln  however  ln load is imposed on one phase  7  a transformer manufacturer s page suggests that ln loading not exceed 5  of transformer capacity  15 
since 3  1.73  defining vln as 100  gives vll  100   1.73   173   if vll was set as 100   then vln  57.7  
unbalanced loads edit 
when the currents on the three live wires of a three-phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120 phase angle  the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system  the method of symmetrical components is used to analyze unbalanced systems 
non-linear loads edit 
with linear loads  the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases  devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front-end such as switch-mode power supplies  computers  office equipment and such produce third-order harmonics that are in-phase on all the supply phases  consequently  such harmonic currents add in the neutral  which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current  13  16 
three-phase loads edit 
an important class of three-phase load is the electric motor  a three-phase induction motor has a simple design  inherently high starting torque and high efficiency  such motors are applied in industry for many applications  a three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating and single-phase ac motors above 10 hp  7.5kw  are uncommon  three-phase motors also vibrate less and hence last longer than single-phase motors of the same power used under the same conditions 
resistance heating loads such as electric boilers or space heating may be connected to three-phase systems  electric lighting may also be similarly connected 
line frequency flicker in light can be reduced by evenly spreading three phases across line frequency operated light sources so that illuminated area is provided light from all three phases  the effect of line frequency flicker is detrimental to super slow motion cameras used in sports event broadcasting  three phase lighting has been applied successfully at the 2008 beijing olympics to provide consistent light level for each frame  17 
rectifiers may use a three-phase source to produce a six-pulse dc output  18  the output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and  unlike single-phase  does not drop to zero between pulses  such rectifiers may be used for battery charging  electrolysis processes such as aluminium production or for operation of dc motors   zig-zag  transformers may make the equivalent of six-phase full-wave rectification  twelve pulses per cycle  and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components  while improving the quality of the resulting dc 
one example of a three-phase load is the electric arc furnace used in steelmaking and in refining of ores 
in many european countries electric stoves are usually designed for a three-phase feed  however  the individual heating units are often connected between phase and neutral to allow for connection to a single-phase circuit e g  if within an older domestic property a three-phase feed is not yet available  19  other usual three-phase loads in the domestic field are tankless water heating systems and storage heaters  however  since those references appeared homes in europe and the uk have standardized on a supply with a nominal 230 v between any phase and ground  in practice existing supplies remain nearer 240 v in the uk  and 220v on much of the continent  only new work is 230v   most groups of houses are fed from a three-phase street transformer so that individual premises with above-average demand can be fed with a second or third phase connection  although domestic appliances are invariably designed to be able to work with a single-phase supply 
phase converters edit 
phase converters are used when three-phase equipment needs to be operated on a single-phase power source  they are used when three-phase power is not available or cost is not justifiable  such converters may also allow the frequency to be varied  resynthesis  allowing speed control  some railway locomotives use a single-phase source to drive three-phase motors fed through an electronic drive  20 
mechanical edit 
one method of generating three-phase power from a single-phase source is the rotary phase converter  essentially a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and power factor correction that produces balanced three-phase voltages  when properly designed  these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source  in such a device  the energy storage is performed by the inertia  flywheel effect  of the rotating components  an external flywheel is sometimes found on one or both ends of the shaft 
a three-phase generator can be driven by a single-phase motor  this motor-generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion  but requires two machines with all their expenses and losses  the motor-generator method can also form an uninterruptible power supply when used in conjunction with a large flywheel and a battery-powered dc motor for really constant power  a standby generator set gives more frequency drop until standby generator kicks in

a second method that was popular in the 1940s and 1950s was the transformer method  at that time  capacitors were more expensive than transformers  so an autotransformer was used to apply more power through fewer capacitors  separated it from another common method  the static converter  as both methods have no moving parts  which separates them from the rotary converters 
another method often attempted is with a device referred to as a static phase converter  this method of running three-phase equipment is commonly attempted with motor loads though it only supplies 2/3 power and can cause the motor loads to run hot and in some cases overheat  this method does not work when sensitive circuitry is involved such as cnc devices or in induction and rectifier-type loads 
variable-frequency drives  vfds   also known as solid-state inverters and adjustable speed drives  are used to provide precise speed and torque control of three-phase motors  some models can be powered by a single-phase supply  vfds work by converting the supply voltage to dc and then converting the dc to a suitable three-phase source for the motor 
digital phase converters are designed for fixed-frequency operation from a single-phase source  similar to a variable-frequency drive  they use a microprocessor to control solid-state power switching components to maintain balanced three-phase voltages 
alternatives to three-phase edit 
split-phase electric power is used when three-phase power is not available and allows double the normal utilization voltage to be supplied for high-power loads 
two-phase electric power  like three-phase  gives constant power transfer to a linear load  for loads that connect each phase to neutral  assuming the load is the same power draw  the two-wire system has a neutral current that is greater than neutral current in a three-phase system  also motors are not entirely linear  which means that despite the theory  motors running on three-phase tend to run smoother than those on two-phase  the generators in the adams power plant at niagara falls that were installed in 1895 were the largest generators in the world at the time and were two-phase machines  true two-phase power distribution is obsolete for  new work  applications  but still exists for  old work  applications  perhaps most particularly in buffalo and niagara falls  ny  toronto and niagara falls  ontario  philadelphia and reading  pa  and camden  nj   new work  three-phase installations may be supplied by old two-phase feeders  and  old work  two-phase installations may be supplied by new three-phase feeders using a scott-t transformer  invented by charles f  scott  21  special-purpose systems may use a two-phase system for frequency control 
monocyclic power was a name for an asymmetrical modified two-phase power system used by general electric around 1897  championed by charles proteus steinmetz and elihu thomson  this system was devised to avoid patent infringement  in this system  a generator was wound with a full-voltage single-phase winding intended for lighting loads and with a small fraction  usually 1/4 of the line voltage  winding that produced a voltage in quadrature with the main windings  the intention was to use this  power wire  additional winding to provide starting torque for induction motors  with the main winding providing power for lighting loads  after the expiration of the westinghouse patents on symmetrical two-phase and three-phase power distribution systems  the monocyclic system fell out of use  it was difficult to analyze and did not last long enough for satisfactory energy metering to be developed 
high-phase-order systems for power transmission have been built and tested  such transmission lines typically would use six or twelve phases  high-phase-order transmission lines allow transfer of slightly less than proportionately higher power through a given volume without the expense of a high-voltage direct current  hvdc  converter at each end of the line  however  they require correspondingly more pieces of equipment 
color codes edit 
see also  electrical wiring colour code
conductors of a three-phase system are usually identified by a color code  to allow for balanced loading and to assure the correct phase rotation for motors  colors used may adhere to international standard iec 60446  now merged into iec 60445   older standards or to no standard at all and may vary even within a single installation  for example  in the u s  and canada  different color codes are used for grounded  earthed  and ungrounded systems

notes edit 
  a b c d in australia and new zealand  active conductors can be any color except green yellow  green  yellow  black or light blue  yellow is no longer permitted in the 2007 revision of wiring code asnzs 3000  european color codes are used for all iec or flex cables such as extension leads  appliance leads etc  and are equally permitted for use in building wiring per as nzs 3000 2007 
  in canada the high leg conductor in a high-leg delta system is always marked red 
  the international standard green-yellow marking of protective-earth conductors was introduced to reduce the risk of confusion by color blind installers  about 7  to 10  of men cannot clearly distinguish between red and green  which is a particular concern in older schemes where red marks a live conductor and green marks protective earth or safety ground 
  in europe  there still exist many installations with older colors but  since the early 1970s  all new installations use green yellow earth according to iec 60446   e g  phase neutral earth german  black grey   red france green red   white russia  red  grey   black  switzerland  red  grey  yellow or yellow   red denmark  white black   red
  see paul cook  harmonised colours and alphanumeric marking  iee wiring matters  spring 2006 
  in the u s   a green yellow striped wire may indicate an isolated ground  citation needed  in most countries today  green yellow striped wire may only be used for protective earth  safety ground  and may never be unconnected or used for any other purpose 
  since 1975  the u s  national electric code has not specified coloring of phase conductors  it is common practice in many regions to identify 120/208  wye  conductors as black  red  and blue  and 277/480  wye or delta  conductors as brown  orange  yellow  in a 120/240 delta system with a 208v high leg  the high leg  typically b phase  is always marked orange  commonly a phase is black and c phase is either red or blue  local regulations may amend the n e c  the u s  national electric code has color requirements for grounded conductors  ground  and grounded-delta 3-phase systems which result in one ungrounded leg having a higher voltage potential to ground than the other two ungrounded legs
