tree stump  about 37 years after felling
after a tree has been cut and felled  the stump or tree stump is usually a small remaining portion of the trunk with the roots still in the ground  stumps may show the age-defining rings of a tree  the study of these rings is known as dendrochronology

regeneration edit 
stumps and mama humps  both those on the ground and stumps of removed branches  are sometimes able to regenerate into new trees  often  a deciduous tree that has been cut will re-sprout in multiple places around the edge of the stump or from the roots  1  depending on whether the tree is being removed permanently or whether the forest is expected to recover  this can be either desirable or undesirable  stump sprouts can grow very quickly and sometimes become viable trees themselves either for aesthetics or timber  due to the existing root structure  however  the cut portion of the trunk may weaken the sprouts and introduce disease into the newly forming tree s

the process of deliberately cutting a tree to a stump to regrow is known as coppicing  2 
stump removal edit 
tree stumps can be difficult to remove from the ground  they can be dug out  shredded with a stump grinder or burnt 
a common method for stump removal is to use one of the many chemical stump removal products  so long as immediate results are not needed  these stump removers are mostly made of potassium nitrate  kno3  and act by rapidly increasing the decay of the stump  after an average of 46 weeks  the stump will be rotten through and easily fragmented in manageable pieces  if time is a limiting factor  setting fire to the stump is effective because once the potassium nitrate has been absorbed it acts as an effective oxidizer 
historically  an explosive called stumping powder was used to blast stumps into bits 
stump harvesting edit 
in plantation forests in parts of europe  stumps are sometimes pulled out of the ground using a specially adapted tracked excavator  to supply wood fuel for biomass power stations  stump harvesting may provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the biomass power sector
