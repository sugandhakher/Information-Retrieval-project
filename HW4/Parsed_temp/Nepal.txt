etymology
local legends have that a hindu sage named  ne  established himself in the valley of kathmandu in prehistoric times and that the word  nepal  came into existence as the place was protected   pala  in pali  by the sage  nemi   it is mentioned in vedic texts that this region was called nepal centuries ago  according to the skanda purana  a rishi called  nemi  used to live in the himalayas  20  in the pashupati purana  he is mentioned as a saint and a protector  21  he is said to have practised meditation at the bagmati and kesavati rivers 22  and to have taught there  23 
the name of the country is also identical in origin to the name of the newar people  the terms  nepl    newr    newl  and  nepr  are phonetically different forms of the same word  and instances of the various forms appear in texts in different times in history  nepal is the learned sanskrit form and newar is the colloquial prakrit form  24  a sanskrit inscription dated 512 ce found in tistung  a valley to the west of kathmandu  contains the phrase  greetings to the nepals  indicating that the term  nepal  was used to refer to both the country and the people  25  26 
it has been suggested that  nepal  may be a sanskritization of  newar   or  newar  may be a later form of  nepal   27  according to another explanation  the words  newar  and  newari  are vulgarisms arising from the mutation of p to v  and l to r  28 
nepal is likely singular for nephilim  n p l   which is ancient semitic for protector  sanskrit is formed from the phnician alphabet i e   canaanite aleph-bet

ancient
neolithic tools found in the kathmandu valley indicate that people have been living in the himalayan region for at least eleven thousand years  29  the oldest population layer is believed to be represented by the kusunda people  30 
nepal is first mentioned in the late vedic atharvaveda pariia as a place exporting blankets and in the post-vedic atharvashirsha upanishad  31  in samudragupta s allahabad pillar it is mentioned as a bordering country  the skanda purana has a separate chapter known as  nepal mahatmya  that explains in more details about the beauty and power of nepal  32  nepal is also mentioned in hindu texts such as the narayana puja  31 
tibeto-burman-speaking people probably lived in nepal 2500 years ago  33  however  there is no archaeologic evidence of the gopal bansa or kirati rulers  only mention by the later licchavi and malla eras  34 
around 500 bce  small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of nepal  from one of these  the shakya polity  arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life  founded buddhism  and came to be known as gautama buddha  traditionally dated 563483 bce  
by 250 bce  the southern regions came under the influence of the maurya empire of north india and parts of nepal later on became a nominal vassal state under the gupta empire in the fourth century ce  beginning in the third century ce  the licchavi kingdom governed the kathmandu valley and the region surrounding central nepal 
there is a quite detailed description of the kingdom of nepal in the account of the renowned chinese buddhist pilgrim monk xuanzang  dating from c  645 ce  35  36  stone inscriptions in the kathmandu valley are important sources for the history of nepal 
the licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late eighth century  probably due to the tibetan empire  and was followed by a newar or thakuri era  from 879 ce  nepal sambat 1   although the extent of their control over the present-day country is uncertain  37  in the eleventh century it seems to have included the pokhara area  by the late eleventh century  southern nepal came under the influence of the chalukya dynasty of south india  under the chalukyas  nepal s religious establishment changed as the kings patronised hinduism instead of the buddhism prevailing at that time

in the mid-18th century  prithvi narayan shah  a gorkha king  set out to put together what would become present-day nepal  he embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms  after several bloody battles and sieges  notably the battle of kirtipur  he managed to conquer the kathmandu valley in 1769  a detailed account of prithvi narayan shah s victory was written by father giuseppe  an eyewitness to the war  38 
the gorkha dominion reached its height when the north indian territories of the kumaon and garhwal kingdoms in the west to sikkim in the east came under nepal rule  at its maximum extent  greater nepal extended from the teesta river in the east  to kangra  himachal pradesh  across the sutlej in the west as well as further south into the terai plains and north of the himalayas than at present  a dispute with tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner tingri valleys of tibet forced the qing emperor of china to start the sino-nepali war compelling the nepali to retreat and pay heavy reparations to peking 
rivalry between kingdom of nepal and the east india company over the annexation of minor states bordering nepal eventually led to the anglo-nepali war  181516   at first the british underestimated the nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing  they were greatly impressed by the valour and competence of their adversaries  thus began the reputation of gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers  the war ended in the sugauli treaty  under which nepal ceded recently captured portions of sikkim and lands in terai as well as the right to recruit soldiers  madhesis  having supported the east india company during the war  had their lands gifted to nepali  39 
factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability  in 1846 a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow jung bahadur kunwar  a fast-rising military leader  this led to the kot massacre  armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country  jung bahadur kunwar emerged victorious and founded the rana dynasty  later known as jung bahadur rana  the king was made a titular figure  and the post of prime minister was made powerful and hereditary  the ranas were staunchly pro-british and assisted them during the indian rebellion of 1857  and later in both world wars   some parts of the terai region populated with non-nepali peoples were gifted to nepal by the british as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain british control in india during the rebellion  in 1923  the united kingdom and nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the sugauli treaty of 1816  39 
slavery was abolished in nepal in 1924  40  nevertheless  debt bondage even involving debtors  children has been a persistent social problem in the terai  rana rule was marked by tyranny  debauchery  economic exploitation and religious persecution  41  42 
in the late 1940s  newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in nepal were critical of the rana autocracy  meanwhile  with the invasion of tibet by china in the 1950s  india sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre-emptive steps to assert more influence in nepal  india sponsored both king tribhuvan  ruled 191155  as nepal s new ruler in 1951 and a new government  mostly comprising the nepali congress  thus terminating rana hegemony in the kingdom  39 
after years of power wrangling between the king and the government  king mahendra  ruled 195572  scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959  and a  partyless  panchayat system was made to govern nepal until 1989  when the  jan andolan   people s movement  forced king birendra  ruled 19722001  to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in may 1991  43  in 199192  bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 bhutanese citizens of nepali descent  most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern nepal ever since  44 
in 1996  the communist party of nepal started a bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people s republic by violent means  this led to the long nepali civil war and more than 12,000 deaths 
on 1 june 2001  there was a massacre in the royal palace  king birendra  queen aishwarya and seven other members of the royal family were killed  the perpetrator was crown prince dipendra  who committed suicide  he died three days later  shortly thereafter  this outburst was alleged to have been dipendra s response to his parents  refusal to accept his choice of wife  nevertheless  there is speculation and doubts among nepali citizens about who was responsible 
following the carnage  king birendra s brother gyanendra inherited the throne  on 1 february 2005  king gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent maoist movement  43  but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed in which the maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside but could not yet dislodge the military from numerous towns and the largest cities  in september 2005  the maoists declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate 
in response to the 2006 democracy movement  king gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the people  on 24 april 2006 the dissolved house of representatives was reinstated  using its newly acquired sovereign authority  on 18 may 2006 the house of representatives unanimously voted to curtail the power of the king and declared nepal a secular state  ending its time-honoured official status as a hindu kingdom  on 28 december 2007  a bill was passed in parliament to amend article 159 of the constitution replacing  provisions regarding the king  by  provisions of the head of the state  declaring nepal a federal republic  and thereby abolishing the monarchy  45  the bill came into force on 28 may 2008  46 
republic  2008 
the unified communist party of nepal  maoist  won the largest number of seats in the constituent assembly election held on 10 april 2008  and formed a coalition government which included most of the parties in the ca  although acts of violence occurred during the pre-electoral period  election observers noted that the elections themselves were markedly peaceful and  well-carried out   47 
dr  ram baran yadav  the first president of nepal
the newly elected assembly met in kathmandu on 28 may 2008  and  after a polling of 564 constituent assembly members  560 voted to form a new government  46  with the monarchist rastriya prajatantra party  which had four members in the assembly  registering a dissenting note  at that point  it was declared that nepal had become a secular and inclusive democratic republic  48  49  with the government announcing a three-day public holiday from 2830 may  the king was thereafter given 15 days to vacate narayanhity palace so it could reopen as a public museum  50 
nonetheless  political tensions and consequent power-sharing battles have continued in nepal  in may 2009  the maoist-led government was toppled and another coalition government with all major political parties barring the maoists was formed  51  madhav kumar nepal of the communist party of nepal  unified marxistleninist  was made the prime minister of the coalition government  52  in february 2011 the madhav kumar nepal government was toppled and jhala nath khanal of the communist party of nepal  unified marxistleninist  was made the prime minister  53  in august 2011 the jhala nath khanal government was toppled and baburam bhattarai of the communist party of nepal  maoist  was made the prime minister  54 
the political parties were unable to draft a constitution in the stipulated time  55  this led to dissolution of the constituent assembly to pave way for new elections to strive for a new political mandate  in opposition to the theory of separation of powers  then chief justice khil raj regmi was made the chairman of the caretaker government  under regmi  the nation saw peaceful elections for the constituent assembly  the major forces in the earlier constituent assembly  namely cpn maoists and madhesi parties  dropped to distant 3rd and even below  56  57 
in february 2014  after consensus was reached between the two major parties in the constituent assembly  sushil koirala was sworn in as the new prime minister of nepal  58  59 
in 20 september 2015  a new constitution  the  constitution of nepal 2015   nepali      was announced by president ram baran yadav in the constituent assembly  the constituent assembly was transformed into a legislative parliament by the then-chairman of that assembly  the new constitution of nepal has changed nepal practically into a federal democratic republic by making 7 unnamed states 
on 25 april 2015  a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck nepal  60  two weeks later  on 12 may  another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 hit nepal  which left more than 8,500 people dead and about 21,000  injured  61 
in october 2015  bidhya devi bhandari was nominated as the first female president  62

nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape  800 kilometres  497mi  long and 200 kilometres  124mi  wide  with an area of 147,181km2  56,827sqmi   see list of territories by size for the comparative size of nepal  it lies between latitudes 26 and 31n  and longitudes 80 and 89e 
nepal is commonly divided into three physiographic areas  mountain  hill and terai  these ecological belts run east-west and are vertically intersected by nepal s major  north to south flowing river systems 
the southern lowland plains or terai bordering india are part of the northern rim of the indo-gangetic plain  they were formed and are fed by three major himalayan rivers  the kosi  the narayani  and the karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline  this region has a subtropical to tropical climate  the outermost range of foothills called sivalik hills or churia range cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres  2,297 to 3,281ft  marks the limit of the gangetic plain  however broad  low valleys called inner tarai valleys  bhitri tarai uptyaka  lie north of these foothills in several places 
the hill region  pahad  abuts the mountains and varies from 800 to 4,000 metres  2,625 to 13,123ft  in altitude with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres  3,937ft  to alpine climates above 3,600 metres  11,811ft   the lower himalayan range reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres  4,921 to 9,843ft  is the southern limit of this region  with subtropical river valleys and  hills  alternating to the north of this range  population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000 metres  6,562ft  and very low above 2,500 metres  8,202ft  where snow occasionally falls in winter 
the mountain region  himal   situated in the great himalayan range  makes up the northern part of nepal  it contains the highest elevations in the world including 8,848 metres  29,029ft  height mount everest  sagarmth in nepali  on the border with china  seven other of the world s  eight-thousanders  are in nepal or on its border with china  lhotse  makalu  cho oyu  kangchenjunga  dhaulagiri  annapurna and manaslu 
climate
nepal has five climatic zones  broadly corresponding to the altitudes  the tropical and subtropical zones lie below 1,200 metres  3,937ft   the temperate zone 1,200 to 2,400 metres  3,937 to 7,874ft   the cold zone 2,400 to 3,600 metres  7,874 to 11,811ft   the subarctic zone 3,600 to 4,400 metres  11,811 to 14,436ft   and the arctic zone above 4,400 metres  14,436ft  
nepal experiences five seasons  summer  monsoon  autumn  winter and spring  the himalaya blocks cold winds from central asia in the winter and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns  in a land once thickly forested  deforestation is a major problem in all regions  with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems 
nepal is popular for mountaineering  having some of the highest and most challenging mountains in the world  including mount everest  technically  the south-east ridge on the nepali side of the mountain is easier to climb  so  most climbers prefer to trek to everest through nepal

geology
main article  geology of nepal
the collision between the indian subcontinent and eurasia  which started in paleogene time and continues today  produced the himalaya and the tibetan plateau  nepal lies completely within this collision zone  occupying the central sector of the himalayan arc  nearly one third of the 2,400km  1,500mi -long himalayas  64  65  66  67  68  69 
the indian plate continues to move north relative to asia at the rate of approximately 50mm  2.0in  per year  70  this is approximately twice the speed at which human fingernails grow  which is very fast given the size of the blocks of earth s crust involved  original research   as the strong indian continental crust subducts beneath the relatively weak tibetan crust  it pushes up the himalayan mountains  this collision zone has accommodated huge amounts of crustal shortening as the rock sequences slide one over another 
based on a study published in 2014  of the main frontal thrust  on average a great earthquake occurs every 750140 and 870350years in the east nepal region  71  a study from 2015 found a 700-year delay between earthquakes in the region  the study also suggests  that because of tectonic stress transfer  the earthquake from 1934 in nepal and the 2015 earthquake are connected - following a historic earthquake pattern  72 
erosion of the himalayas is a very important source of sediment  which flows via several great rivers  the indus  ganges  and brahmaputra river systems to the indian ocean  73 
environment
the dramatic differences in elevation found in nepal result in a variety of biomes  from tropical savannas along the indian border  to subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the hill region  to temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests on the slopes of the himalaya  to montane grasslands and shrublands and rock and ice at the highest elevations 
at the lowest elevations is the terai-duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion  these form a mosaic with the himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests  which occur from 500 to 1,000 metres  1,600 to 3,300ft  and include the inner terai valleys  himalayan subtropical pine forests occur between 1,000 and 2,000 metres  3,300 and 6,600ft  
above these elevations  the biogeography of nepal is generally divided from east to west by the gandaki river  ecoregions to the east tend to receive more precipitation and to be more species-rich  those to the west are drier with fewer species 
from 1,500 to 3,000 metres  4,900 to 9,800ft   are temperate broadleaf forests  the eastern and western himalayan broadleaf forests  from 3,000 to 4,000 metres  9,800 to 13,100ft  are the eastern and western himalayan subalpine conifer forests  to 5,500 metres  18,000ft  are the eastern and western himalayan alpine shrub and meadows

nepal has seen rapid political changes during the last two decades  up until 1990  nepal was a monarchy under executive control of the king  faced with a communist movement against absolute monarchy  king birendra  in 1990  agreed to a large-scale political reform by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the king as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of the government 
nepal s legislature was bicameral  consisting of a house of representatives called the pratinidhi sabha and a national council called the rastriya sabha  the house of representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people  the national council had 60 members  ten nominated by the king  35 elected by the house of representatives  and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns  the legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end  all nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote 
the executive comprised the king and the council of ministers  the cabinet   the leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the prime minister  the cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the prime minister  governments in nepal tended to be highly unstable  falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch  on the recommendation of the prime minister  according to the constitution  no government has survived for more than two years since 1991 
the movement in april 2006 brought about a change in the nation s governance  an interim constitution was promulgated  with the king giving up power  and an interim house of representatives was formed with maoist members after the new government held peace talks with the maoist rebels  the number of parliamentary seats was also increased to 330  in april 2007  the communist party of nepal  maoist  joined the interim government of nepal 
in december 2007  the interim parliament passed a bill making nepal a federal republic  with a president as head of state  elections for the constitutional assembly were held on 10 april 2008  the maoist party led the results but did not achieve a simple majority of seats  74  the new parliament adopted the 2007 bill at its first meeting by an overwhelming majority  and king gyanendra was given 15 days to leave the royal palace in central kathmandu  he left on 11 june  75 
on 26 june 2008  the prime minister girija prasad koirala  who had served as acting head of state since january 2007  announced that he would resign on the election of the country s first president by the constituent assembly  the first round of voting  on 19 july 2008  saw parmanand jha win election as nepali vice-president  but neither of the contenders for president received the required 298 votes and a second round was held two days later  ram baran yadav of the nepali congress party defeated maoist-backed ram raja prasad singh with 308 of the 590 votes cast  76  koirala submitted his resignation to the new president after yadav s swearing-in ceremony on 23 july 2008 
on 15 august 2008  maoist leader prachanda  pushpa kamal dahal  was elected prime minister of nepal  the first since the country s transition from a monarchy to a republic  on 4 may 2009  dahal resigned over on-going conflicts with regard to the sacking of the army chief  since dahal s resignation  the country has been in a serious political deadlock with one of the big issues being the proposed integration of the former maoist combatants  also known as the people s liberation army  into the national security forces  77  after dahal  jhala nath khanal of cpn  uml  was elected the prime minister  khanal was forced to step down as he could not succeed in carrying forward the peace process and the constitution writing  on august 2011  maoist babu ram bhattarai became third prime minister after the election of constituent assembly  78  on 24 may 2012  nepals s deputy pm krishna sitaula resigned  79  on 27 may 2012  the country s constituent assembly failed to meet the deadline for writing a new constitution for the country  prime minister baburam bhattarai announced that new elections will be held on 22 november 2012   we have no other option but to go back to the people and elect a new assembly to write the constitution   he said in a nationally televised speech  one of the main obstacles has been disagreement over whether the states which will be created will be based on ethnicity  80 
nepal is one of the few countries in asia to abolish the death penalty  81  nepal is the only asian country where the possibility of same-sex marriage has been proposed in the high court and in the legislature although same-sex marriage currently does not exist in nepal  see also lgbt rights in nepal and same-sex marriage in nepal   the decision was based on a seven-person government committee study  and enacted through supreme court s ruling november 2008  the ruling granted full rights for lgbt individuals  including the right to marry 82  and now can get citizenship as a third gender rather than male or female as authorized by nepal s supreme court in 2007  83

tribhuvan international airport  tourism is a key part of the national economy  with nepal receiving approx  800,000 foreign visitors each year  91 
nepal s gross domestic product  gdp  for 2012 was estimated at over  17.921 billion  adjusted to nominal gdp   6  in 2010  agriculture accounted for 36.1   services comprised 48.5   and industry 15.4  of nepal s gdp  92  while agriculture and industry are contracting  the contribution by the service sector is increasing  92  93 
agriculture employs 76  of the workforce  services 18  and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6   agricultural produce mostly grown in the terai region bordering india includes tea  rice  corn  wheat  sugarcane  root crops  milk  and water buffalo meat  industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce  including jute  sugarcane  tobacco  and grain  its workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labor 
nepal s economic growth continues to be adversely affected by the political uncertainty  nevertheless  real gdp growth was estimated to increase to almost 5 percent for 20112012  this is an improvement from the 3.5 percent gdp growth in 20102011 and would be the second-highest growth rate in the post-conflict era  94  sources of growth include agriculture  construction  financial and other services  the contribution of growth by consumption fueled by remittances has declined since 2010/2011  while remittance growth slowed to 11 percent  in nepali rupee terms  in 2010/2011  it has since increased to 37 percent  remittances are estimated to be equivalent to 2530 percent of gdp  inflation has been reduced to a three-year low of 7 percent  94 
the proportion of poor people has declined substantially since 2003  the percentage of people living below the international poverty line  people earning less than us 1.25 per day  has halved in seven years  94  at this measure of poverty the percentage of poor people declined from 53.1  in 2003/2004 to 24.8  in 2010/2011  94  with a higher poverty line of us 2 per-capita per day  poverty declined by one-quarter to 57.3   94  however  the income distribution remains grossly uneven  95 
in a recent survey  nepal has performed extremely well in reducing poverty along with rwanda and bangladesh as the percentage of poor dropped to 44.2 percent of the population in 2011 from 64.7 percent in 20064.1 percentage points per year  which means that nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition  child mortality  electricity  improved flooring and assets  if the progress of reducing poverty continues at this rate  then it is predicted that nepal will halve the current poverty rate and eradicate it within the next 20 years  96  97  98 
the spectacular landscape and diverse  exotic cultures of nepal represent considerable potential for tourism  but growth in the industry has been stifled by political instability and poor infrastructure  despite these problems  in 2012 the number of international tourists visiting nepal was 598,204  a 10  increase on the previous year  99  the tourism sector contributed nearly 3  of national gdp in 2012 and is the second-biggest foreign income earner after remittances  100 
the rate of unemployment and underemployment approaches half of the working-age population  thus many nepali citizens move to other countries in search of work  destinations include india  qatar  the united states  thailand  the united kingdom  saudi arabia  japan  brunei darussalam  australia  and canada  101  102  nepal receives  50 million a year through the gurkha soldiers who serve in the indian and british armies and are highly esteemed for their skill and bravery  as of 2010 update   the total remittance value is around  3.5 billion  102  in 2009 alone  the remittance contributed to 22.9  of the nation s gdp  102 
a long-standing economic agreement underpins a close relationship with india  the country receives foreign aid from the uk  103  104  india  japan  the us  the eu  china  switzerland  and scandinavian countries  poverty is acute  per-capita income is around  1,000  105  the distribution of wealth among the nepali is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries  the highest 10  of households control 39.1  of the national wealth and the lowest 10  control only 2.6  
the government s budget is about  1.153 billion  with an expenditure of  1.789 billion  fy 20005/06   the nepali rupee has been tied to the indian rupee at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years  since the loosening of exchange rate controls in the early 1990s  the black market for foreign exchange has all but disappeared  the inflation rate has dropped to 2.9  after a period of higher inflation during the 1990s 
nepal s exports of mainly carpets  clothing  hemp  leather goods  jute goods and grain total  822 million  import commodities of mainly gold  machinery and equipment  petroleum products and fertilizer total us 2 billion  european union  eu   46.13    the us  17.4    and germany  7.1   are its main export partners  the european union has emerged the largest buyer of nepali ready-made garments  rmg   exports to the eu accounted for  46.13 percent of the country s total garment exports   106  nepal s import partners include india  47.5    the united arab emirates  11.2    china  10.7    saudi arabia  4.9    and singapore  4   
besides having landlocked  rugged geography  few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure  the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the nation s economic growth and development  107  108  109

middle marshyandi hydroelectricity dam  nepal has significant potential to generate hydropower  which it plans to export across south asia
the bulk of the energy in nepal comes from fuel wood  68    agricultural waste  15    animal dung  8    and imported fossil fuels  8    110  111  except for some lignite deposits  nepal has no known oil  gas or coal deposits  all commercial fossil fuels  mainly oil and coal  are either imported from india or from international markets routed through india and china  fuel imports absorb over one-fourth of nepal s foreign exchange earnings  111 
only about 1  energy need is fulfilled by electricity  the perennial nature of nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country s topography provide ideal conditions for the development of some of the world s largest hydroelectric projects  current estimates put nepal s economically feasible hydropower potential to be approximately 83,000 mw from 66 hydropower project sites  111  112  however  currently nepal has been able to exploit only about 600 mw from 20 medium to large hydropower plants and a number of small and micro hydropower plants  110  there are 9 major hydropower plants under construction  and additional 27 sites considered for potential development  110  only about 40  of nepal s population has access to electricity  110  there is a great disparity between urban and rural areas  the electrification rate in urban areas is 90   whereas the rate for rural areas is only 5   111  power cuts of up to 22 hours a day take place in peak demand periods of winter and the peak electricity demand is almost the double the capability or dependable capacity  113  the position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs  high system losses  high generation costs  high overheads  over staffing  and lower domestic demand  111 
transport
main article  transport in nepal
nepal remains isolated from the world s major land  air and sea transport routes although  within the country  aviation is in a better state  with 47 airports  11 of them with paved runways  114  flights are frequent and support a sizable traffic  the hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive  in 2007 there were just over 10,142km  6,302mi  of paved roads  and 7,140km  4,437mi  of unpaved road  and one 59km  37mi  railway line in the south  114 
there is a single reliable road route from india to the kathmandu valley  more than one-third of its people live at least a two hours walk from the nearest all-season road  15 out of 75 district headquarters are not connected by road  in addition  around 60  of road network and most rural roads are not operable during the rainy season  115  the only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for kathmandu is kolkata in west bengal state of india  internally  the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets  schools  and health clinics a challenge  107 
telecommunications and mass media
according to the nepal telecommunication authority mis may 2012 report  116  there are seven operators and the total voice telephony subscribers including fixed and mobile are 16,350,946 which gives a penetration rate of 61.42   the fixed telephone service account for 9.37   mobile for 64.63   and other services  lm  gmpcs  for 3.76  of the total penetration rate  similarly  the numbers of subscribers to data internet services are 4,667,536 which represents 17.53  penetration rate  most of the data service is accounted by gprs users  twelve months earlier the data internet penetration was 10.05   thus this represents a growth rate of 74.77   116 
not only has there been strong subscriber growth  especially in the mobile sector  but there was evidence of a clear vision in the sector  including putting a reform process in place and planning for the building of necessary telecommunications infrastructure  most importantly  the ministry of information and communications  moic  and the telecom regulator  the national telecommunications authority  nta   have both been very active in the performance of their respective roles  117 
despite all the effort  there remained a significant disparity between the high coverage levels in the cities and the coverage available in the underdeveloped rural regions  progress on providing some minimum access had been good  of a total of 3,914 village development committees across the country  306 were unserved by december 2009  117  in order to meet future demand  it was estimated that nepal needed to invest around us 135 million annually in its telecom sector  117  in 2009  the telecommunication sector alone contributed to 1  of the nation s gdp  118  as of 30 september 2012  nepal has 1,828,700 facebook users  119 
as of 2007 update   the state operates two television stations as well as national and regional radio stations  there are roughly 30 independent tv channels registered  with only about half in regular operation  nearly 400 fm radio stations are licensed with roughly 300 operational  114  according to the 2011 census  the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82   television 36.45   cable tv 19.33   computer 7.23   5  according to the press council nepal  as of 2012 update  there are 2,038 registered newspapers in nepal  among which 514 are in publication  120  in 2013  reporters without borders ranked nepal at 118th place in the world in terms of press freedom  121  122

however  increasing access to secondary education  grade 912  remains a major challenge  as evidenced by the low net enrollment rate of 24  at this level  more than half of primary students do not enter secondary schools  and only one-half of them complete secondary schooling  in addition  fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and  among those who do  fewer complete the 10th grade  125 
nepal has seven universities  tribhuvan university  kathmandu university  pokhara university  purbanchal university  mahendra sanskrit university  far-western university  and agriculture and forestry university  126  some newly proposed universities are lumbini bouddha university  and mid-western university  some fine scholarship has emerged in the post-1990 era  127

community forestry
the community forestry program in nepal is a participatory environmental governance that encompasses well-defined policies  institutions  and practices  the program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction  as more than 70 percent of nepal s population depends on agriculture for their livelihood  community management of forests has been a critically important intervention  through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades  the program has evolved from a protection-oriented  conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use  enterprise development  and livelihood improvement  by april 2009  one-third of nepal s population was participating in the program  directly managing more than one-fourth of nepal s forest area  138  139 
the immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources  community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods  community forestry shows traits of political  financial  and ecological sustainability  including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework  and robust civil society institutions and networks  however  a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups  lessons for replication emphasize experiential learning  establishment of a strong civil society network  flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities  and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process  140  141
