climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time  i e   decades to millions of years   climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions  or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions  i e   more or fewer extreme weather events   climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes  variations in solar radiation received by earth  plate tectonics  and volcanic eruptions  certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change  often referred to as global warming  1 
scientists actively work to understand past and future climate by using observations and theoretical models  a climate recordextending deep into the earth s pasthas been assembled  and continues to be built up  based on geological evidence from borehole temperature profiles  cores removed from deep accumulations of ice  floral and faunal records  glacial and periglacial processes  stable-isotope and other analyses of sediment layers  and records of past sea levels  more recent data are provided by the instrumental record  general circulation models  based on the physical sciences  are often used in theoretical approaches to match past climate data  make future projections  and link causes and effects in climate change

terminology
see also  global warming etymology
the most general definition of climate change is a change in the statistical properties  principally its mean and spread  2  of the climate system when considered over long periods of time  regardless of cause  3  accordingly  fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades  such as el nio  do not represent climate change 
the term sometimes is used to refer specifically to climate change caused by human activity  as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of earth s natural processes  4  in this sense  especially in the context of environmental policy  the term climate change has become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming  within scientific journals  global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas levels affect  5 
climatic change versus climate change
in 1966  the world meteorological organization  wmo  proposed the term climatic change to encompass all forms of climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years  whether the cause was natural or anthropogenic  change was a given and climatic was used as an adjective to describe this kind of change  as opposed to political or economic change   when it was realized that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate  the term climate change replaced climatic change as the dominant term to reflect an anthropogenic cause  climate change was incorporated in the title of the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  and the un framework convention on climate change  unfccc   climate change  used as a noun  became an issue rather than the technical description of changing weather  6 
causes
on the broadest scale  the rate at which energy is received from the sun and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of earth  this energy is distributed around the globe by winds  ocean currents  and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different regions 
factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or  forcing mechanisms   7  these include processes such as variations in solar radiation  variations in the earth s orbit  variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents and oceans  mountain-building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations  there are a variety of climate change feedbacks that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing  some parts of the climate system  such as the oceans and ice caps  respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings  while others respond more quickly  there are also key threshold factors which when exceeded can produce rapid change 
forcing mechanisms can be either  internal  or  external   internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself  e g   the thermohaline circulation   external forcing mechanisms can be either natural  e g   changes in solar output  or anthropogenic  e g   increased emissions of greenhouse gases  
whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external  the response of the climate system might be fast  e g   a sudden cooling due to airborne volcanic ash reflecting sunlight   slow  e g  thermal expansion of warming ocean water   or a combination  e g   sudden loss of albedo in the arctic ocean as sea ice melts  followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water   therefore  the climate system can respond abruptly  but the full response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or even longer 
internal forcing mechanisms
scientists generally define the five components of earth s climate system to include atmosphere  hydrosphere  cryosphere  lithosphere  restricted to the surface soils  rocks  and sediments   and biosphere  8  natural changes in the climate system   internal forcings   result in internal  climate variability   9  examples include the type and distribution of species  and changes in ocean currents 
ocean variability
main article  thermohaline circulation
see also  climate inertia
pacific decadal oscillation 1925 to 2010
the ocean is a fundamental part of the climate system  some changes in it occurring at longer timescales than in the atmosphere  as it has hundreds of times more mass and thus very high thermal inertia  with effects such as the ocean depths still lagging today in temperature adjustment from effects of the little ice age of past centuries   clarification needed  10 
short-term fluctuations  years to a few decades  such as the el nio-southern oscillation  the pacific decadal oscillation  the north atlantic oscillation  and the arctic oscillation  represent climate variability rather than climate change  on longer time-scales  alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat by carrying out a very slow and extremely deep movement of water and the long-term redistribution of heat in the world s oceans 
a schematic of modern thermohaline circulation  tens of millions of years ago  continental-plate movement formed a land-free gap around antarctica  allowing the formation of the acc  which keeps warm waters away from antarctica 
life
life affects climate through its role in the carbon and water cycles and through such mechanisms as albedo  evapotranspiration  cloud formation  and weathering  11  12  13  examples of how life may have affected past climate include 
glaciation 2.3 billion years ago triggered by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis  which depleted the atmosphere of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and introduced free oxygen  14  15 
another glaciation 300 million years ago ushered in by long-term burial of decomposition-resistant detritus of vascular land-plants  creating a carbon sink and forming coal  16  17 
termination of the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum 55 million years ago by flourishing marine phytoplankton 18  19 
reversal of global warming 49 million years ago by 800,000 years of arctic azolla blooms 20  21 
global cooling over the past 40 million years driven by the expansion of grass-grazer ecosystems 22  23 
external forcing mechanisms
milankovitch cycles from 800,000 years ago in the past to 800,000 years in the future 
variations in co2  temperature and dust from the vostok ice core over the last 450,000 years
orbital variations
main article  milankovitch cycles
slight variations in earth s orbit lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the earth s surface and how it is distributed across the globe  there is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine  but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution  the three types of orbital variations are variations in earth s eccentricity  changes in the tilt angle of earth s axis of rotation  and precession of earth s axis  combined together  these produce milankovitch cycles which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods  24  their correlation with the advance and retreat of the sahara  24  and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record  25  26 
the ipcc notes that milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles  co2 followed temperature change  with a lag of some hundreds of years   and that as a feedback amplified temperature change  27  the depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature  thermal inertia on such scale   upon seawater temperature change  the solubility of co2 in the oceans changed  as well as other factors impacting air-sea co2 exchange  28 
solar output
main article  solar variation
variations in solar activity during the last several centuries based on observations of sunspots and beryllium isotopes  the period of extraordinarily few sunspots in the late 17th century was the maunder minimum 
the sun is the predominant source of energy input to the earth  other sources include geothermal energy from the earth s core  and heat from the decay of radioactive compounds  both long- and short-term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate 
three to four billion years ago  the sun emitted only 70  as much power as it does today  if the atmospheric composition had been the same as today  liquid water should not have existed on earth  however  there is evidence for the presence of water on the early earth  in the hadean 29  30  and archean 31  29  eons  leading to what is known as the faint young sun paradox  32  hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere  with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist  33  over the following approximately 4 billion years  the energy output of the sun increased and atmospheric composition changed  the great oxygenation event oxygenation of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years ago was the most notable alteration  over the next five billion years  the sun s ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate  with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on earth that survives until that time 
solar output also varies on shorter time scales  including the 11-year solar cycle 34  and longer-term modulations  35  solar intensity variations possibly as a result of the wolf  sprer and maunder minimum are considered to have been influential in triggering the little ice age  36  and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950  the cyclical nature of the sun s energy output is not yet fully understood  it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the sun as it ages and evolves  research indicates that solar variability has had effects including the maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715 a d   part of the little ice age from 1550 to 1850 a d  that was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward  37  38  some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming  and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects  solar variation  anthropogenic radiative forcings  etc    39  40 
interestingly  a 2010 study 41  suggests  that the effects of solar variability on temperature throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectations 
in an aug 2011 press release  42  cern announced the publication in the nature journal the initial results from its cloud experiment  the results indicate that ionisation from cosmic rays significantly enhances aerosol formation in the presence of sulfuric acid and water  but in the lower atmosphere where ammonia is also required  this is insufficient to account for aerosol formation and additional trace vapours must be involved  the next step is to find more about these trace vapours  including whether they are of natural or human origin

volcanism
in atmospheric temperature from 1979 to 2010  determined by msu nasa satellites  effects appear from aerosols released by major volcanic eruptions  elchichn and pinatubo   elnio is a separate event  from ocean variability 
the eruptions considered to be large enough to affect the earth s climate on a scale of more than 1 year are the ones that inject over 100,000 tons of so2 into the stratosphere  43  this is due to the optical properties of so2 and sulfate aerosols  which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation  creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze  44  on average  such eruptions occur several times per century  and cause cooling  by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the earth s surface  for a period of a few years 
the eruption of mount pinatubo in 1991  the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century  affected the climate substantially  subsequently global temperatures decreased by about 0.5c  0.9f  for up to three years  45  46  thus  the cooling over large parts of the earth reduced surface temperatures in 1991-93  the equivalent to a reduction in net radiation of 4 watts per square meter  47  the mount tambora eruption in 1815 caused the year without a summer  48  much larger eruptions  known as large igneous provinces  occur only a few times every fifty - hundred million years - through flood basalt  and caused in earth past global warming and mass extinctions  49 
small eruptions  with injections of less than 0.1 mt of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere  impact the atmosphere only subtly  as temperature changes are comparable with natural variability  however  because smaller eruptions occur at a much higher frequency  they too have a significant impact on earth s atmosphere  43  50 
seismic monitoring maps current and future trends in volcanic activities  and tries to develop early warning systems  in climate modelling the aim is to study the physical mechanisms and feedbacks of volcanic forcing  51 
volcanoes are also part of the extended carbon cycle  over very long  geological  time periods  they release carbon dioxide from the earth s crust and mantle  counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks  the us geological survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities  which generate 100300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes  52  a review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide  including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges  volcanic arcs  and hot spot volcanoes  are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days of human caused output  the annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supererruptions  the most recent of which was the toba eruption in indonesia 74,000 years ago  53 
although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere  which itself is part of the climate system  the ipcc explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agent  54 
plate tectonics
main article  plate tectonics
over the course of millions of years  the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography  this can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation  55 
the position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation  the locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe  and therefore  in determining global climate  a recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the isthmus of panama about 5 million years ago  which shut off direct mixing between the atlantic and pacific oceans  this strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the gulf stream and may have led to northern hemisphere ice cover  56  57  during the carboniferous period  about 300 to 360 million years ago  plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation  58  geologic evidence points to a  megamonsoonal  circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent pangaea  and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons  59 
the size of continents is also important  because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature  yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland  a larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands 
human influences
increase in atmospheric co2 levels
main article  global warming
in the context of climate variation  anthropogenic factors are human activities which affect the climate  the scientific consensus on climate change is  that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities   60  and it  is largely irreversible   61 
science has made enormous inroads in understanding climate change and its causes  and is beginning to help develop a strong understanding of current and potential impacts that will affect people today and in coming decades  this understanding is crucial because it allows decision makers to place climate change in the context of other large challenges facing the nation and the world  there are still some uncertainties  and there always will be in understanding a complex system like earths climate  nevertheless  there is a strong  credible body of evidence  based on multiple lines of research  documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities  while much remains to be learned  the core phenomenon  scientific questions  and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations 
united states national research council  advancing the science of climate change
of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in co2 levels due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion  followed by aerosols  particulate matter in the atmosphere  and the co2 released by cement manufacture  other factors  including land use  ozone depletion  animal agriculture 62  and deforestation  are also of concern in the roles they play both separately and in conjunction with other factors in affecting climate  microclimate  and measures of climate variables  63 
physical evidence
2015  warmest global year on record  since 1880   colors indicate temperature anomalies  nasa noaa  20 january 2016   64 
comparisons between asian monsoons from 200 ad to 2000 ad  staying in the background on other plots   northern hemisphere temperature  alpine glacier extent  vertically inverted as marked   and human history as noted by the u s  nsf 
arctic temperature anomalies over a 100-year period as estimated by nasa  typical high monthly variance can be seen  while longer-term averages highlight trends 
evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be used to reconstruct past climates  reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 19th century  for earlier periods  most of the evidence is indirectclimatic changes are inferred from changes in proxies  indicators that reflect climate  such as vegetation  ice cores  65  dendrochronology  sea level change  and glacial geology 
temperature measurements and proxies
the instrumental temperature record from surface stations was supplemented by radiosonde balloons  extensive atmospheric monitoring by the mid-20th century  and  from the 1970s on  with global satellite data as well  the 18o 16o ratio in calcite and ice core samples used to deduce ocean temperature in the distant past is an example of a temperature proxy method  as are other climate metrics noted in subsequent categories 
historical and archaeological evidence
main article  historical impacts of climate change
climate change in the recent past may be detected by corresponding changes in settlement and agricultural patterns  66  archaeological evidence  oral history and historical documents can offer insights into past changes in the climate  climate change effects have been linked to the collapse of various civilizations  66 
decline in thickness of glaciers worldwide over the past half-century
glaciers
glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change  67  their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output  as temperatures warm  glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt  the converse is also true 
glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings  variability in temperature  precipitation  and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season  therefore  one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate 
a world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s  initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites  this compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000km2  and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000km2  the world glacier monitoring service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance  from this data  glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly  with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s  stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s  and again retreating from the mid-1980s to present  68 
the most significant climate processes since the middle to late pliocene  approximately 3 million years ago  are the glacial and interglacial cycles  the present interglacial period  the holocene  has lasted about 11,700 years  69  shaped by orbital variations  responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate  other changes  including heinrich events  dansgaardoeschger events and the younger dryas  however  illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing 
glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of materialincluding organic matter  quartz  and potassium that may be datedrecording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated  similarly  by tephrochronological techniques  the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained 
arctic sea ice loss
main articles  arctic sea ice decline and climate change in the arctic
the decline in arctic sea ice  both in extent and thickness  over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change  70  sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface  it covers millions of square miles in the polar regions  varying with the seasons  in the arctic  some sea ice remains year after year  whereas almost all southern ocean or antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually  satellite observations show that arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.3 percent per decade  relative to the 1981 to 2010 average  71 
play media
this video summarizes how climate change  associated with increased carbon dioxide levels  has affected plant growth 
vegetation
a change in the type  distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate  some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth  resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne co2  a gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times  driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms  conversely  cold will cause plant bio-cycles to lag  72  larger  faster or more radical changes  however  may result in vegetation stress  rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances  73  74  an example of this occurred during the carboniferous rainforest collapse  crc   an extinction event 300 million years ago  at this time vast rainforests covered the equatorial region of europe and america  climate change devastated these tropical rainforests  abruptly fragmenting the habitat into isolated  islands  and causing the extinction of many plant and animal species  73 
pollen analysis
palynology is the study of contemporary and fossil palynomorphs  including pollen  palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species  which vary under different climate conditions  different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures  and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material  they resist decay  changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes  bogs  or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities  these changes are often a sign of a changing climate  75  76  as an example  palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the quaternary glaciations 77  and especially since the last glacial maximum  78

cloud cover and precipitation
see also  cloud and precipitation
past precipitation can be estimated in the modern era with the global network of precipitation gauges  surface coverage over oceans and remote areas is relatively sparse  but  reducing reliance on interpolation  satellite clouds and precipitation data has been available since the 1970s  80  quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments  ice cores  cave stalagmites  and tree rings  81  in july 2016 scientists published evidence of increased cloud cover over polar regions  82  as predicted by climate models  83 
climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation  for instance  during the last glacial maximum of 18,000 years ago  thermal-driven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low  causing large areas of extreme desert  including polar deserts  cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation   79  in contrast  the world s climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm atlantic period of 8000 years ago  79 
estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2  over the course of the 20th century  though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen  complicated by enso and other oscillations  including greater global land cloud cover precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century overall  80  84  85  similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived  84 
dendroclimatology
dendroclimatology is the analysis of tree ring growth patterns to determine past climate variations  86  wide and thick rings indicate a fertile  well-watered growing period  whilst thin  narrow rings indicate a time of lower rainfall and less-than-ideal growing conditions 
ice cores
analysis of ice in a core drilled from an ice sheet such as the antarctic ice sheet  can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations  the air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the co2 variations of the atmosphere from the distant past  well before modern environmental influences  the study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in co2 over many millennia  and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions 
animals
remains of beetles are common in freshwater and land sediments  different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions  given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia  knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species  and the age of the sediments in which remains are found  past climatic conditions may be inferred  87 
similarly  the historical abundance of various fish species has been found to have a substantial relationship with observed climatic conditions  88  changes in the primary productivity of autotrophs in the oceans can affect marine food webs  89 
sea level change
main articles  sea level and current sea level rise
global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using tide gauge measurements collated over long periods of time to give a long-term average  more recently  altimeter measurements in combination with accurately determined satellite orbits have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change  90  to measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements  scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean  coastal sediments  marine terraces  ooids in limestones  and nearshore archaeological remains  the predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon  with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall  in the early pliocene  global temperatures were 12c warmer than the present temperature  yet sea level was 1525 meters higher than today  91
