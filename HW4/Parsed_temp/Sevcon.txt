it was founded in 1961 as sevcon engineering ltd  the company was formed to develop technology originated by horace william heyman  13 march 1912 - 4 september 1998   who had been managing director of smith electric vehicles from 1949 until 1964  it was the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in europe 
his technology improved battery-life for frequent start-stop runs of electric vehicles at low speeds  there were always large electrical losses on starting an electric vehicle because of electrical resistances heating up  the technology allowed a 20  reduction in battery size for equivalent power  or increased battery length or power for a standard-sized battery 
an electric vehicle would have had resistances to drop the voltage on the motor when starting  but this created heating  his technology employed semiconductor-controlled rectifiers  with a semiconductor oscillator  which provided pulses of electrical power to power the motor
