consumption is major concept in economics and is also studied by many other social sciences  economists are particularly interested in the relationship between consumption and income  as modeled with the consumption function 
different schools of economists define production and consumption differently  according to mainstream economists  only the final purchase of goods and services by individuals constitutes consumption  while other types of expenditure  in particular  fixed investment  intermediate consumption  and government spending  are placed in separate categories  see consumer choice   other economists define consumption much more broadly  as the aggregate of all economic activity that does not entail the design  production and marketing of goods and services  e g  the selection  adoption  use  disposal and recycling of goods and services   citation needed

consumption function edit 
main article  consumption function
the consumption function is a mathematical function that expresses consumer spending in terms of its determinants  such as income and accumulated wealth 
behavioural economics and consumption edit 
the keynesian consumption function is also known as the absolute income hypothesis  as it only bases consumption on current income and ignores potential future income  or lack of   criticism of this assumption led to the development of milton friedman s permanent income hypothesis and franco modigliani s life cycle hypothesis  more recent theoretical approaches are based on behavioral economics and suggest that a number of behavioural principles can be taken as microeconomic foundations for a behaviourally-based aggregate consumption function  1 
consumption and household production edit 
consumption is defined in part by comparison to production  in the tradition of the columbia school of household economics  also known as the new home economics  commercial consumption has to be analyzed in the context of household production  the opportunity cost of time affects the cost of home-produced substitutes and therefore demand for commercial goods and services  2  3  the elasticity of demand for consumption goods is also a function of who performs chores in households and how their spouses compensate them for opportunity costs of home production  4 
different schools of economists define production and consumption differently  according to mainstream economists  only the final purchase of goods and services by individuals constitutes consumption  while other types of expenditure  in particular  fixed investment  intermediate consumption  and government spending  are placed in separate categories  see consumer choice   other economists define consumption much more broadly  as the aggregate of all economic activity that does not entail the design  production and marketing of goods and services  e g  the selection  adoption  use  disposal and recycling of goods and services   citation needed 
consumption can also be measured by a variety of different ways such as energy in energy economics metrics 
effects of consumption edit 
aggregate consumption is a component of aggregate demand  5  according to the un   todays consumption is undermining the environmental resource base  it is exacerbating inequalities  and the dynamics of the consumption-poverty-inequality-environment nexus are accelerating  if the trends continue without change  not redistributing from high-income to low-income consumers  not shifting from polluting to cleaner goods and production technologies  not shifting priority from consumption for conspicuous display to meeting basic needs  todays problems of consumption and human development will worsen   developing countries like india  as they move down the path of copying the consumption patterns of developed economies  will basically create demands that earth will not be able to fulfill  some economists who   talk about putting a price on using earth s resources which is in addition to the cost of just extracting them 
old-age spending edit 
spending the kids  inheritance  originally the title of a book on the subject by annie hulley  and the acronyms ski and ski ing refer to the growing number of older people in western society spending their money on travel  cars and property  in contrast to previous generations who tended to leave that money to their children 
die broke  from the book die broke  a radical four-part financial plan by stephen pollan and mark levine  is a similar idea
