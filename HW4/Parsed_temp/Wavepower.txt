wave power is the transport of energy by wind waves  and the capture of that energy to do useful work  for example  electricity generation  water desalination  or the pumping of water  into reservoirs   a machine able to exploit wave power is generally known as a wave energy converter  wec  
wave power is distinct from the diurnal flux of tidal power and the steady gyre of ocean currents  wave-power generation is not currently a widely employed commercial technology  although there have been attempts to use it since at least 1890  1  in 2008  the first experimental wave farm was opened in portugal  at the aguadoura wave park  2

physical concepts edit 
when an object bobs up and down on a ripple in a pond  it follows approximately an elliptical trajectory 
motion of a particle in an ocean wave 
a   at deep water  the elliptical motion of fluid particles decreases rapidly with increasing depth below the surface 
b   at shallow water  ocean floor is now at b   the elliptical movement of a fluid particle flattens with decreasing depth

see energy  power  and work for more information on these important physical concepts  see wind wave for more information on ocean waves 
waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea  as long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves  there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves  both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave crest  as well as friction on the water surface by the wind  making the water to go into the shear stress causes the growth of the waves  4 
wave height is determined by wind speed  the duration of time the wind has been blowing  fetch  the distance over which the wind excites the waves  and by the depth and topography of the seafloor  which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves   a given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves  when this limit has been reached the sea is said to be  fully developed  
in general  larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed  wavelength  and water density 
oscillatory motion is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth  however  for standing waves  clapotis  near a reflecting coast  wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth  producing microseisms  4  these pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power 
the waves propagate on the ocean surface  and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the group velocity  the mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical plane of unit width  parallel to a wave crest  is called the wave energy flux  or wave power  which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device  
wave power formula edit 
in deep water where the water depth is larger than half the wavelength  the wave energy flux is a

with p the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length  hm0 the significant wave height  te the wave energy period   the water density and g the acceleration by gravity  the above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the square of the wave height  when the significant wave height is given in metres  and the wave period in seconds  the result is the wave power in kilowatts  kw  per metre of wavefront length  5  6  7  8 
example  consider moderate ocean swells  in deep water  a few km off a coastline  with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds  using the formula to solve for power  we get

meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest 
in major storms  the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds  according to the above formula  such waves carry about 1.7mw of power across each metre of wavefront 
an effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux  as a result  the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device 
wave energy and wave-energy flux edit 
in a sea state  the average mean  energy density per unit area of gravity waves on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared  according to linear wave theory  4  9

where e is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area  j m2   the sum of kinetic and potential energy density per unit horizontal area  the potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy  4  both contributing half to the wave energy density e  as can be expected from the equipartition theorem  in ocean waves  surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few decimetres 
as the waves propagate  their energy is transported  the energy transport velocity is the group velocity  as a result  the wave energy flux  through a vertical plane of unit width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction  is equal to  11  4

deep-water characteristics and opportunities edit 
deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength  which is the common situation in the sea and ocean  in deep water  longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster  the deep-water group velocity is half the phase velocity  in shallow water  for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth  as found quite often near the coast  the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity  12 
history edit 
the first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799  and was filed in paris by girard and his son  13  an early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by bochaux-praceique to light and power his house at royan  near bordeaux in france  14  it appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device  15  from 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the uk alone  13 
modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by yoshio masuda s experiments in the 1940s  16  he has tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea  with several hundred units used to power navigation lights  among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft  which was proposed in the 1950s by masuda  17 
a renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the oil crisis in 1973  a number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves  among whom notably were stephen salter from the university of edinburgh  kjell budal and johannes falnes from norwegian institute of technology  now merged into norwegian university of science and technology   michael e  mccormick from u s  naval academy  david evans from bristol university  michael french from university of lancaster  nick newman and c  c  mei from mit 
stephen salter s 1974 invention became known as salter s duck or nodding duck  although it was officially referred to as the edinburgh duck  in small scale controlled tests  the duck s curved cam-like body can stop 90  of wave motion and can convert 90  of that to electricity giving 81  efficiency  18 
in the 1980s  as the oil price went down  wave-energy funding was drastically reduced  nevertheless  a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea  more recently  following the issue of climate change  there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy  including wave energy  19 
the world s first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the uk  based in orkney  scotland  the european marine energy centre  emec  has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world  emec provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions  it s grid connected wave test site is situated at billia croo  on the western edge of the orkney mainland  and is subject to the full force of the atlantic ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site  wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include aquamarine power  pelamis wave power  scottishpower renewables and wello  20 
modern technology edit 
wave power devices are generally categorized by the method used to capture the energy of the waves  by location and by the power take-off system  locations are shoreline  nearshore and offshore  types of power take-off include  hydraulic ram  elastomeric hose pump  pump-to-shore  hydroelectric turbine  air turbine  21  and linear electrical generator  when evaluating wave energy as a technology type  it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches  point absorber buoys  surface attenuators  oscillating water columns  and overtopping devices 
generic wave energy concepts  1  point absorber  2  attenuator  3  oscillating wave surge converter  4  oscillating water column  5  overtopping device  6  submerged pressure differential
point absorber buoy edit 
this device floats on the surface of the water  held in place by cables connected to the seabed  buoys use the rise and fall of swells to drive hydraulic pumps and generate electricity  emf generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms  the presence of the buoys may affect fish  marine mammals  and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites  potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines  energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline  resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore  22 
surface attenuator edit 
these devices act similarly to point absorber buoys  with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves  a flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity  environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys  with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints  22 
oscillating wave surge converter edit 
these devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move  energy is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point  oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats  flaps  or membranes  environmental concerns include minor risk of collision  artificial reefing near the fixed point  emf effects from subsea cables  and energy removal effecting sediment transport  22  some of these designs incorporate parabolic reflectors as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture  these capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy  23  once the wave energy is captured at a wave source  power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the electrical grid by transmission power cables  24 
oscillating water column edit 
oscillating water column devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore  with an air chamber integrated into the device  swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create electricity  25  significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines  potentially affecting birds and other marine organisms within the vicinity of the device  there is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers  22 
overtopping device edit 
overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean  the potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines  devices can be either on shore or floating offshore  floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting benthic organisms  organisms becoming entangled  or emf effects produced from subsea cables  there is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat  22

environmental effects edit

common environmental concerns associated with marine energy developments include 
the risk of marine mammals and fish being struck by tidal turbine blades 
the effects of emf and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices 
the physical presence of marine energy projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals  fish  and seabirds with attraction or avoidance 
the potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as sediment transport and water quality 
the tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of wave energy  27 
potential edit 
the worldwide resource of wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 tw  28  locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of europe  the northern coast of the uk  and the pacific coastlines of north and south america  southern africa  australia  and new zealand  the north and south temperate zones have the best sites for capturing wave power  the prevailing westerlies in these zones blow strongest in winter 
world wave energy resource map
challenges edit 
there is a potential impact on the marine environment  noise pollution  for example  could have negative impact if not monitored  although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly  7  other biophysical impacts  flora and fauna  sediment regimes and water column structure and flows  of scaling up the technology is being studied  29  in terms of socio-economic challenges  wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds  can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment  and may represent hazards to safe navigation  30  waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power  of those 2,700 gigawatts  only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology  23 
wave farms edit 
main article  wave farm
portugal edit 
the aguadoura wave farm was the world s first wave farm  it was located 5km  3mi  offshore near pvoa de varzim  north of porto  portugal  the farm was designed to use three pelamis wave energy converters to convert the motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity  totalling to 2.25 mw in total installed capacity  the farm first generated electricity in july 2008 31  and was officially opened on september 23  2008  by the portuguese minister of economy  32  33  the wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in november 2008 as a result of the financial collapse of babcock   brown due to the global economic crisis  the machines were off-site at this time due to technical problems  and although resolved have not returned to site and were subsequently scrapped in 2011 as the technology had moved on to the p2 variant as supplied to eon and scottish power renewables  34  a second phase of the project planned to increase the installed capacity to 21 mw using a further 25 pelamis machines 35  is in doubt following babcock s financial collapse 
united kingdom edit 
funding for a 3 mw wave farm in scotland was announced on february 20  2007  by the scottish executive  at a cost of over 4 million pounds  as part of a 13 million funding package for marine power in scotland  the first machine was launched in may 2010  36 
a facility known as wave hub has been constructed off the north coast of cornwall  england  to facilitate wave energy development  the wave hub will act as giant extension cable  allowing arrays of wave energy generating devices to be connected to the electricity grid  the wave hub will initially allow 20 mw of capacity to be connected  with potential expansion to 40 mw  four device manufacturers have so far expressed interest in connecting to the wave hub  37  38  the scientists have calculated that wave energy gathered at wave hub will be enough to power up to 7,500 households  the site has the potential to save greenhouse gas emissions of about 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide in the next 25 years  39 
australia edit 
a ceto wave farm off the coast of western australia has been operating to prove commercial viability and  after preliminary environmental approval  underwent further development  40  41  in early 2015 a  100 million  multi megawatt system was connected to the grid  with all the electricity being bought to power hmas stirling naval base  two fully submerged buoys which are anchored to the seabed  transmit the energy from the ocean swell through hydraulic pressure onshore  to drive a generator for electricity  and also to produce fresh water  as of 2015 update  a third buoy is planned for installation  42  43
