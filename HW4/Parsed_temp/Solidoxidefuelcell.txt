introduction edit 
solid oxide fuel cells are a class of fuel cells characterized by the use of a solid oxide material as the electrolyte  sofcs use a solid oxide electrolyte to conduct negative oxygen ions from the cathode to the anode  the electrochemical oxidation of the oxygen ions with hydrogen or carbon monoxide thus occurs on the anode side  more recently  proton-conducting sofcs  pc-sofc  are being developed which transport protons instead of oxygen ions through the electrolyte with the advantage of being able to be run at lower temperatures than traditional sofcs 
they operate at very high temperatures  typically between 500 and 1,000c  at these temperatures  sofcs do not require expensive platinum catalyst material  as is currently necessary for lower temperature fuel cells such as pemfcs  and are not vulnerable to carbon monoxide catalyst poisoning  however  vulnerability to sulfur poisoning has been widely observed and the sulfur must be removed before entering the cell through the use of adsorbent beds or other means 
solid oxide fuel cells have a wide variety of applications  from use as auxiliary power units in vehicles to stationary power generation with outputs from 100 w to 2 mw  in 2009  australian company  ceramic fuel cells successfully achieved an efficiency of an sofc device up to the previously theoretical mark of 60   2  3  the higher operating temperature make sofcs suitable candidates for application with heat engine energy recovery devices or combined heat and power  which further increases overall fuel efficiency 
because of these high temperatures  light hydrocarbon fuels  such as methane  propane  and butane can be internally reformed within the anode  sofcs can also be fueled by externally reforming heavier hydrocarbons  such as gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  jp-8  or biofuels  such reformates are mixtures of hydrogen  carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  steam and methane  formed by reacting the hydrocarbon fuels with air or steam in a device upstream of the sofc anode  sofc power systems can increase efficiency by using the heat given off by the exothermic electrochemical oxidation within the fuel cell for endothermic steam reforming process  additionally  solid fuels such as coal and biomass may be gasified to form syngas which is suitable for fueling sofcs in integrated gasification fuel cell power cycles 
thermal expansion demands a uniform and well-regulated heating process at startup  sofc stacks with planar geometry require in the order of an hour to be heated to light-off temperature  micro-tubular fuel cell design geometries promise much faster start up times  typically in the order of minutes 
unlike most other types of fuel cells  sofcs can have multiple geometries  the planar fuel cell design geometry is the typical sandwich type geometry employed by most types of fuel cells  where the electrolyte is sandwiched in between the electrodes  sofcs can also be made in tubular geometries where either air or fuel is passed through the inside of the tube and the other gas is passed along the outside of the tube  the tubular design is advantageous because it is much easier to seal air from the fuel  the performance of the planar design is currently better than the performance of the tubular design  however  because the planar design has a lower resistance comparatively  other geometries of sofcs include modified planar fuel cell designs  mpc or mpsofc   where a wave-like structure replaces the traditional flat configuration of the planar cell  such designs are highly promising because they share the advantages of both planar cells  low resistance  and tubular cells 
operation edit 
cross section of three ceramic layers of a tubular sofc  from left to right  porous cathode  dense electrolyte  porous anode
a solid oxide fuel cell is made up of four layers  three of which are ceramics  hence the name   a single cell consisting of these four layers stacked together is typically only a few millimeters thick  hundreds of these cells are then connected in series to form what most people refer to as an  sofc stack   the ceramics used in sofcs do not become electrically and ionically active until they reach very high temperature and as a consequence  the stacks have to run at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1,000c  reduction of oxygen into oxygen ions occurs at the cathode  these ions can then diffuse through the solid oxide electrolyte to the anode where they can electrochemically oxidize the fuel  in this reaction  a water byproduct is given off as well as two electrons  these electrons then flow through an external circuit where they can do work  the cycle then repeats as those electrons enter the cathode material again 
balance of plant edit 
most of the downtime of a sofc stems from the mechanical balance of plant  the air preheater  prereformer  afterburner  water heat exchanger  anode tail gas oxidizer  and electrical balance of plant  power electronics  hydrogen sulfide sensor and fans  internal reforming leads to a large decrease in the balance of plant costs in designing a full system  3 
anode edit 
the ceramic anode layer must be very porous to allow the fuel to flow towards the electrolyte  consequently  granular matter is often selected for anode fabrication procedures  4  like the cathode  it must conduct electrons  with ionic conductivity a definite asset  the most common material used is a cermet made up of nickel mixed with the ceramic material that is used for the electrolyte in that particular cell  typically ysz  yttria stabilized zirconia  nanomaterial-based catalysts  this ysz part helps stop the grain growth of nickel  larger grains of nickel would reduce the contact area that ions can be conducted through  which would lower the cells efficiencyx  the anode is commonly the thickest and strongest layer in each individual cell  because it has the smallest polarization losses  and is often the layer that provides the mechanical support  electrochemically speaking  the anodes job is to use the oxygen ions that diffuse through the electrolyte to oxidize the hydrogen fuel  the oxidation reaction between the oxygen ions and the hydrogen produces heat as well as water and electricity  if the fuel is a light hydrocarbon  for example  methane  another function of the anode is to act as a catalyst for steam reforming the fuel into hydrogen  this provides another operational benefit to the fuel cell stack because the reforming reaction is endothermic  which cools the stack internally  perovskite materials  mixed ionic electronic conducting ceramics  have been shown to produce a power density of 0.6 w cm2 at 0.7 v at 800c which is possible because they have the ability to overcome a larger activation energy   5 
electrolyte edit 
the electrolyte is a dense layer of ceramic that conducts oxygen ions  its electronic conductivity must be kept as low as possible to prevent losses from leakage currents  the high operating temperatures of sofcs allow the kinetics of oxygen ion transport to be sufficient for good performance  however  as the operating temperature approaches the lower limit for sofcs at around 600 c  the electrolyte begins to have large ionic transport resistances and affect the performance  popular electrolyte materials include yttria-stabilized zirconia  ysz   often the 8  form 8ysz   scandia stabilized zirconia  scsz   usually 9mol sc2o3  9scsz  and gadolinium doped ceria  gdc   6  the electrolyte material has crucial influence on the cell performances  7  detrimental reactions between ysz electrolytes and modern cathodes such as lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite  lscf  have been found  and can be prevented by thin   100nm  ceria diffusion barriers  8 
if the conductivity for oxygen ions in sofc can remain high even at lower temperatures  current target in research  500c   material choices for sofc will broaden and many existing problems can potentially be solved  certain processing techniques such as thin film deposition 9  can help solve this problem with existing materials by 
reducing the traveling distance of oxygen ions and electrolyte resistance as resistance is inversely proportional to conductor length 
producing grain structures that are less resistive such as columnar grain structure 
controlling the microstructural nano-crystalline fine grains to achieve  fine-tuning  of electrical properties 
building composite possessing large interfacial areas as interfaces have been shown to have extraordinary electrical properties 
cathode edit 
the cathode  or air electrode  is a thin porous layer on the electrolyte where oxygen reduction takes place  the overall reaction is written in krger-vink notation as follows

cathode materials must be  at a minimum  electronically conductive  currently  lanthanum strontium manganite  lsm  is the cathode material of choice for commercial use because of its compatibility with doped zirconia electrolytes  mechanically  it has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to ysz and thus limits stress buildup because of cte mismatch  also  lsm has low levels of chemical reactivity with ysz which extends the lifetime of the materials  unfortunately  lsm is a poor ionic conductor  and so the electrochemically active reaction is limited to the triple phase boundary  tpb  where the electrolyte  air and electrode meet  lsm works well as a cathode at high temperatures  but its performance quickly falls as the operating temperature is lowered below 800c  in order to increase the reaction zone beyond the tpb  a potential cathode material must be able to conduct both electrons and oxygen ions  composite cathodes consisting of lsm ysz have been used to increase this triple phase boundary length  mixed ionic electronic conducting  miec  ceramics  such as perovskite lscf  are also being researched for use in intermediate temperature sofcs as they are more active and can make up for the increase in the activation energy of the reaction 
interconnect edit 
the interconnect can be either a metallic or ceramic layer that sits between each individual cell  its purpose is to connect each cell in series  so that the electricity each cell generates can be combined  because the interconnect is exposed to both the oxidizing and reducing side of the cell at high temperatures  it must be extremely stable  for this reason  ceramics have been more successful in the long term than metals as interconnect materials  however  these ceramic interconnect materials are very expensive as compared to metals  nickel- and steel-based alloys are becoming more promising as lower temperature  600800c  sofcs are developed  the material of choice for an interconnect in contact with y8sz is a metallic 95cr-5fe alloy  ceramic-metal composites called  cermet  are also under consideration  as they have demonstrated thermal stability at high temperatures and excellent electrical conductivity 
polarizations edit 
polarizations  or overpotentials  are losses in voltage due to imperfections in materials  microstructure  and design of the fuel cell  polarizations result from ohmic resistance of oxygen ions conducting through the electrolyte  ir   electrochemical activation barriers at the anode and cathode  and finally concentration polarizations due to inability of gases to diffuse at high rates through the porous anode and cathode  shown as a for the anode and c for cathode   citation needed  the cell voltage can be calculated using the following equation

in sofcs  it is often important to focus on the ohmic and concentration polarizations since high operating temperatures experience little activation polarization  however  as the lower limit of sofc operating temperature is approached   600c   these polarizations do become important  10 
above mentioned equation is used for determining the sofc voltage  in fact for fuel cell voltage in general   this approach results in good agreement with particular experimental data  for which adequate factors were obtained  and poor agreement for other than original experimental working parameters  moreover  most of the equations used require the addition of numerous factors which are difficult or impossible to determine  it makes very difficult any optimizing process of the sofc working parameters as well as design architecture configuration selection  because of those circumstances a few other equations were proposed  11

ohmic polarization edit 
ohmic losses in an sofc result from ionic conductivity through the electrolyte  this is inherently a materials property of the crystal structure and atoms involved  however  to maximize the ionic conductivity  several methods can be done  firstly  operating at higher temperatures can significantly decrease these ohmic losses  substitutional doping methods to further refine the crystal structure and control defect concentrations can also play a significant role in increasing the conductivity  another way to decrease ohmic resistance is to decrease the thickness of the electrolyte layer 
ionic conductivity edit 
an ionic specific resistance of the electrolyte as a function of temperature can be described by the following relationship  11

concentration polarization edit 
the concentration polarization is the result of practical limitations on mass transport within the cell and represents the voltage loss due to spatial variations in reactant concentration at the chemically active sites  this situation can be caused when the reactants are consumed by the electrochemical reaction faster than they can diffuse into the porous electrode  and can also be caused by variation in bulk flow composition  the latter is due to the fact that the consumption of reacting species in the reactant flows causes a drop in reactant concentration as it travels along the cell  which causes a drop in the local potential near the tail end of the cell 
the concentration polarization occurs in both the anode and cathode  the anode can be particularly problematic  as the oxidation of the hydrogen produces steam  which further dilutes the fuel stream as it travels along the length of the cell  this polarization can be mitigated by reducing the reactant utilization fraction or increasing the electrode porosity  but these approaches each have significant design trade-offs 
activation polarization edit 
the activation polarization is the result of the kinetics involved with the electrochemical reactions  each reaction has a certain activation barrier that must be overcome in order to proceed and this barrier leads to the polarization  the activation barrier is the result of many complex electrochemical reaction steps where typically the rate limiting step is responsible for the polarization  the polarization equation shown below is found by solving the butlervolmer equation in the high current density regime  where the cell typically operates   and can be used to estimate the activation polarization

the polarization can be modified by microstructural optimization  the triple phase boundary  tpb  length  which is the length where porous  ionic and electronically conducting pathways all meet  directly relates to the electrochemically active length in the cell  the larger the length  the more reactions can occur and thus the less the activation polarization  optimization of tpb length can be done by processing conditions to affect microstructure or by materials selection to use a mixed ionic electronic conductor to further increase tpb length 
target edit 
doe target requirements are 40,000 hours of service for stationary fuel cell applications and greater than 5,000 hours for transportation systems  fuel cell vehicles  at a factory cost of  40 kw for a 10kw coal-based system 14  without additional requirements  lifetime effects  phase stability  thermal expansion compatibility  element migration  conductivity and aging  must be addressed  the solid state energy conversion alliance 2008  interim  target for overall degradation per 1,000 hours is 4.0   15 
research edit 
research is going now in the direction of lower-temperature sofcs  600c   low temperature systems can reduce costs by reducing insolation  materials  start-up and degradation-related costs  with higher operating temperatures  the temperature gradient increases the severity of thermal stresses  which affects materials cost and life of the system  16  an intermediate temperature system  650-800c  would enable the use of cheaper metallic materials with better mechanical properties and thermal conductivity  new developments in nano-scale electrolyte structures have been shown to bring down operating temperatures to around 350c  which would enable the use of even cheaper steel and elastomeric polymeric components  17 
lowering operating temperatures has the added benefit of increased efficiency  theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases with decreasing temperature  for example  the efficiency of a sofc using co as fuel increases from 63  to 81  when decreasing the system temperature from 900c to 350c  17 
research is also under way to improve the fuel flexibility of sofcs  while stable operation has been achieved on a variety of hydrocarbon fuels  these cells typically rely on external fuel processing  in the case of natural gas  the fuel is either externally or internally reformed and the sulfur compounds are removed  these processes add to the cost and complexity of sofc systems  work is under way at a number of institutions to improve the stability of anode materials for hydrocarbon oxidation and  therefore  relax the requirements for fuel processing and decrease sofc balance of plant costs 
research is also going on in reducing start-up time to be able to implement sofcs in mobile applications  18  this can be partially achieved by lowering operating temperatures  which is the case for proton exchange membrane fuel cells  pemfcs   19  due to their fuel flexibility  they may run on partially reformed diesel  and this makes sofcs interesting as auxiliary power units  apu  in refrigerated trucks 
specifically  delphi automotive systems are developing an sofc that will power auxiliary units in automobiles and tractor-trailers  while bmw has recently stopped a similar project  a high-temperature sofc will generate all of the needed electricity to allow the engine to be smaller and more efficient  the sofc would run on the same gasoline or diesel as the engine and would keep the air conditioning unit and other necessary electrical systems running while the engine shuts off when not needed  e g   at a stop light or truck stop   citation needed 
rolls-royce is developing solid-oxide fuel cells produced by screen printing onto inexpensive ceramic materials  rolls-royce fuel cell systems ltd is developing an sofc gas turbine hybrid system fueled by natural gas for power generation applications in the order of a megawatt  e g  futuregen   citation needed 
3d printing is being explored as a possible manufacturing technique that could be used to make sofc manufacturing easier by the shah lab at northwestern university  this manufacturing technique would allow sofc cell structure to be more flexible  which could lead to more efficient designs  this process could work in the production of any part of the cell  the 3d printing process works by combining about 80  ceramic particles with 20  binders and solvents  and then converting that slurry into an ink that can be fed into a 3d printer  some of the solvent is very volatile  so the ceramic ink solidifies almost immediately  not all of the solvent evaporates  so the ink maintains some flexibility before it it is fired at high temperature to densify it  this flexibility allows the cells to be fired in a circular shape that would increase the surface area over which electrochemical reactions can occur  which increases the efficiency of the cell  also  the 3d printing technique allows the cell layers to be printed on top of each other instead of having to go through separate manufacturing and stacking steps  the thickness is easy to control  and layers can be made in the exact size and shape that is needed  so waste is minimized   20 
ceres power ltd  has developed a low cost and low temperature  500600 degrees  sofc stack using cerium gadolinium oxide  cgo  in place of current industry standard ceramic  yttria stabilized zirconia  ysz   which allows the use of stainless steel to support the ceramic  21

sienergy systems  a harvard spin-off company  has demonstrated the first macro-scale thin-film solid-oxide fuel cell that can operate at 500 degrees  23 
soec edit 
a solid oxide electrolyser cell  soec  is a solid oxide fuel cell set in regenerative mode for the electrolysis of water with a solid oxide  or ceramic  electrolyte to produce oxygen and hydrogen gas  24 
itsofc edit 
sofcs that operate in an intermediate temperature  it  range  meaning between 600 and 800c  are named itsofcs  because of the high degradation rates and materials costs incurred at temperatures in excess of 900c  it is economically more favorable to operate sofcs at lower temperatures  the push for high-performance itsofcs is currently the topic of much research and development  one area of focus is the cathode material  it is thought that the oxygen reduction reaction is responsible for much of the loss in performance so the catalytic activity of the cathode is being studied and enhanced through various techniques  including catalyst impregnation 
lt-sofc edit 
low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells  lt-sofcs   operating lower than 650c  are of great interest for future research because the high operating temperature is currently what restricts the development and deployment of sofcs  a low-temperature sofc is more reliable due to smaller thermal mismatch and easier sealing  additionally  a lower temperature requires less insulation and therefore has a lower cost  cost is further lowered due to wider material choices for interconnects and compressive nonglass ceramic seals  perhaps most importantly  at a lower temperature  sofcs can be started more rapidly and with less energy  which lends itself to uses in portable and transportable applications 
interestingly  as temperature decreases  the maximum theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases  in contrast to the carnot cycle  for example  the maximum theoretical efficiency of an sofc using co as a fuel increases from 63  at 900c to 81  at 350c  25 
this is a materials issue  particularly for the electrolyte in the sofc  ysz is the most commonly used electrolyte because of its superior stability  despite not having the highest conductivity  currently  the thickness of ysz electrolytes is a minimum of  10 m due to deposition methods  and this requires a temperature above 700c  therefore  low-temperature sofcs are only possible with higher conductivity electrolytes  various alternatives that could be successful at low temperature include gallium-doped ceria  gdc  and erbia-cation-stabilized bismuth  erb   they have superior ionic conductivity at lower temperatures  but this comes at the expense of lower thermodynamic stability  ceo2 electrolytes become electronically conductive and bi2o3 electrolytes decompose to metallic bi under the reducing fuel environment  26 
to combat this  researchers created a functionally graded ceria bismuth-oxide bilayered electrolyte where the gdc layer on the anode side protects the esb layer from decomposing while the esb on the cathode side blocks the leakage current through the gdc layer  this leads to near-theoretical open-circuit potential  opc  with two highly conductive electrolytes  that by themselves would not have been sufficiently stable for the application  this bilayer proved to be stable for 1400 hours of testing at 500c and showed no indication of interfacial phase formation or thermal mismatch  while this makes strides towards lowering the operating temperature of sofcs  it also opens doors for future research to try and understand this mechanism  27 
comparison of ionic conductivity of various solid oxide electrolytes
researchers at the georgia institute of technology dealt with the instability of baceo3 differently  they replaced a desired fraction of ce in baceo3 with zr to form a solid solution that exhibits proton conductivity  but also chemical and thermal stability over the range of conditions relevant to fuel cell operation  a new specific composition  ba zr0.1ce0.7y0.2 o3-  bzcy7  that displays the highest ionic conductivity of all known electrolyte materials for sofc applications  this electrolyte was fabricated by dry-pressing powders  which allowed for the production of crack free films thinner than 15 m  the implementation of this simple and cost-effective fabrication method may enable significant cost reductions in sofc fabrication  28  however  this electrolyte operates at higher temperatures than the bilayered electrolyte model  closer to 600c rather than 500c 
currently  given the state of the field for lt-sofcs  progress in the electrolyte would reap the most benefits  but research into potential anode and cathode materials would also lead to useful results  and has started to be discussed more frequently in literature 
sofc-gt edit 
an sofc-gt system is one which comprises a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine  such systems have been evaluated by siemens westinghouse and rolls-royce as a means to achieve higher operating efficiencies by running the sofc under pressure  sofc-gt systems typically include anodic and or cathodic atmosphere recirculation  thus increasing efficiency 
theoretically  the combination of the sofc and gas turbine can give result in high overall  electrical and thermal  efficiency  29  further combination of the sofc-gt in a combined cooling  heat and power  or trigeneration  configuration  via hvac  also has the potential to yield even higher thermal efficiencies in some cases  30 
moreover  another interesting feature of the introduced hybrid system is on the gain of 100  co2 capturing at comparable high energy efficiency  these features like zero co2 emission and high energy efficiency make the power plant performance noteworthy  31 
dcfc edit 
for the direct use of solid coal fuel without additional gasification and reforming processes  a direct carbon fuel cell  dcfc  has been developed as a promising novel concept of a high-temperature energy conversion system  the underlying progress in the development of a coal-based dcfc has been categorized mainly according to the electrolyte materials used  such as solid oxide  molten carbonate  and molten hydroxide  as well as hybrid systems consisting of solid oxide and molten carbonate binary electrolyte or of liquid anode  fe  ag  in  sn  sb  pb  bi  and its alloying and its metal metal oxide  solid oxide electrolyte  32  
sofc operated on landfill gas
every household produces waste garbage on a daily basis  in 2009  americans produced about 243 million tons of municipal solid waste  which is 4.3 pounds of waste per person per day  all that waste is sent to landfill sites  landfill gas which is produced from the decomposition of waste that gets accumulated at the landfills has the potential to be a valuable source of energy since methane is a major constituent  currently  the majority of the landfills either burn away their gas in flares or combust it in mechanical engines to produce electricity  the issue with mechanical engines is that incomplete combustion of gasses can lead to pollution of the atmosphere and is also highly inefficient 
the issue with using landfill gas to fuel an sofc system is that landfill gas contains hydrogen sulfide  any landfill accepting biological waste will contain about 50-60 ppm of hydrogen sulfide and around 1-2 ppm mercaptans  however  construction materials containing reducible sulfur species  principally sulfates found in gypsum-based wallboard  can cause considerably higher levels of sulfides in the hundreds of ppm  at operating temperatures of 750 c hydrogen sulfide concentrations of around 0.05 ppm begin to affect the performance of the sofcs 
ni   h2s  nis   h2
the above reaction controls the effect of sulfur on the anode 
this can be prevented by having background hydrogen which is calculated below 
at 453 k the equilibrium constant is 7.39 x 105
g calculated at 453 k was 35.833 kj mol
using the standard heat of formation and entropy g at room temperature  298 k  came out to be 45.904 kj mol
on extrapolation to 1023 k  g is -1.229 kj mol
on substitution  keq at 1023 k is 1.44 x 104  hence theoretically we need 3.4  hydrogen to prevent the formation of nis at 5 ppm h2s  33
