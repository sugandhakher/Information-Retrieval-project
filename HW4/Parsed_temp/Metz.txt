the local law  french  droit local  applied in metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with french law  created in 1919  it preserves the french laws applied in france before 1870 and maintained by the germans during the annexation of alsace-lorraine  but repealed in the rest of france after 1871  it also maintains german laws enacted by the german empire between 1871 and 1918  specific provisions adopted by the local authorities  and french laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in alsace-lorraine  this specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion  social work and finance 
the most striking of the legal differences between france and alsace-lorraine is the absence in alsace-lorraine of strict secularism  even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the french government  alsace-lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the concordat of 1801  which provides for the public subsidy of the roman catholic  lutheran  and calvinist churches and the jewish religion
