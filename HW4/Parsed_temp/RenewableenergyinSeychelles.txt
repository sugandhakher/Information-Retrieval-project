renewable energy in seychelles is a recent development in providing power to the country  electricity for the island nation of seychelles is primarily produced by diesel generators which must import their fuel  69 mw on mahe and 12 mw on praslin   1  energy policy calls for 15  renewables by 2030  in june 2013  the first wind farm in seychelles was officially inaugurated  this 6 mw power plant can produce up to 2  of the seychelles  power 2  and is located on mah island  it is expected that the wind farm will replace 1.6 million litres of diesel fuel  3  the wind farm is expected to generate 7ghw of electricity and the islands consume 350ghw of electricity per year  2  the project was developed by masdar of abu dhabi  unison of s  korea manufactured and installed the wind farm  with a 2-year maintenance contract upon commissioning 
electricity production is expected to be highly seasonal with the majority of energy produced in the months of june to september when wind  4  strength and wind probability are highest on the island of mahe 
project development
the wind farm project was fully funded by the abu dhabi government through a  28million 5  grant to the seychelles  the abu dhabi government appointed masdar as project manager 
the wind farm was originally envisaged to be commissioned by november 2012  6  however this suffered several delays  the commissioning date was moved to february 2013  7  but just three of the eight turbines were commissioned by this date  8  the farm was finally fully commissioned 8 months later than first planned in june 2013 
the wind farm operator  the state owned public utilities corporation  puc   confirmed  9  on 25 july 2013 that one of the turbines was out of operation due to an overheating transformer  this followed weeks of speculation on local social media networks that one of the turbines was not in operation  the puc also confirmed that the farm had produced 2.4ghw of electricity during 2013 up to 25 july 2013  approximately halfway through the windy season  energy production from the wind farm is therefore expected to be below expectations in 2013
