about edit 
the convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biological conservation of biodiversity is  a common concern of humankind  and is an integral part of the development process  the agreement covers all ecosystems  species  and genetic resources  it links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably  it sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources  notably those destined for commercial use  it also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its cartagena protocol on biosafety  addressing technology development and transfer  benefit-sharing and biosafety issues  importantly  the convention is legally binding  countries that join it   parties   are obliged to implement its provisions 
the convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use  while past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats  the convention recognizes that ecosystems  species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans  however  this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity 
the convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity  lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat  the convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity  it argues  however  that conservation will bring us significant environmental  economic and social benefits in return 
the convention on biological diversity of 2010 would ban some forms of geoengineering
issues edit 
some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include 
measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity

cartagena protocol edit 
main article  cartagena protocol on biosafety
the cartagena protocol on biosafety of the convention  also known as the biosafety protocol  was adopted in january 2000  the biosafety protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology 
the biosafety protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits  it will for example let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton 
the required number of 50 instruments of ratification accession approval acceptance by countries was reached in may 2003  in accordance with the provisions of its article 37  the protocol entered into force on 11 september 2003

criticism edit 
although the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions  19  examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening  the fifth report of the european union  for example  makes frequent reference to animals  particularly fish  and plants  but does not mention bacteria  fungi or protists at all  20  the international society for fungal conservation has assessed more than 100 of these cbd documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories  no documents were assessed as good or adequate  less than 10  as nearly adequate or poor  and the rest as deficient  seriously deficient or totally deficient  21
