the cis tower in manchester  england was clad in pv panels at a cost of 5.5 million  it started feeding electricity to the national grid in november 2005 
building-integrated photovoltaics  bipv  are photovoltaic materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelope such as the roof  skylights  or facades  1  they are increasingly being incorporated into the construction of new buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power  although existing buildings may be retrofitted with similar technology  the advantage of integrated photovoltaics over more common non-integrated systems is that the initial cost can be offset by reducing the amount spent on building materials and labor that would normally be used to construct the part of the building that the bipv modules replace  these advantages make bipv one of the fastest growing segments of the photovoltaic industry  citation needed 
the term building-applied photovoltaics  bapv  is sometimes used to refer to photovoltaics that are a retrofit  integrated into the building after construction is complete  most building-integrated installations are actually bapv  some manufacturers and builders differentiate new construction bipv from bapv  2

history edit 
pv applications for buildings began appearing in the 1970s  aluminum-framed photovoltaic modules were connected to  or mounted on  buildings that were usually in remote areas without access to an electric power grid  in the 1980s photovoltaic module add-ons to roofs began being demonstrated  these pv systems were usually installed on utility-grid-connected buildings in areas with centralized power stations  in the 1990s bipv construction products specially designed to be integrated into a building envelope became commercially available  3  a 1998 doctoral thesis by patrina eiffert  entitled an economic assessment of bipv  hypothesized that one day there would an economic value for trading renewable energy credits  recs   4  a 2011 economic assessment and brief overview of the history of bipv by the u s  national renewable energy laboratory suggests that there may be significant technical challenges to overcome before the installed cost of bipv is competitive with photovoltaic panels  5  however  there is a growing consensus that through their widespread commercialization  bipv systems will become the backbone of the zero energy building  zeb  european target for 2020  6  despite technical promise  social barriers to widespread use have also been identified  such as the conservative culture of the building industry and integration with high-density urban design  these authors suggest enabling long-term use likely depends on effective public policy decisions as much as the technological development  7

2009 energy project award winning 525 kilowatt bipv coolply system manufactured by solarframeworks  co  on the patriot place complex adjacent to the gillette stadium in foxborough  ma  system is installed on single-ply roofing membrane on a flat roof using no roof penetrations 
bapv solar facade on a municipal building located in madrid  spain  
building-integrated photovoltaic modules are available in several forms 
flat roofs
the most widely installed to date is an amorphous thin film solar cell integrated to a flexible polymer module which has been attached to the roofing membrane using an adhesive sheet between the solar module backsheet and the roofing membrane  clarification needed 
pitched roofs
modules shaped like multiple roof tiles 
solar shingles are modules designed to look and act like regular shingles  while incorporating a flexible thin film cell 
it extends normal roof life by protecting insulation and membranes from ultraviolet rays and water degradation  it does this by eliminating condensation because the dew point is kept above the roofing membrane  8 
facade
facades can be installed on existing buildings  giving old buildings a whole new look  these modules are mounted on the facade of the building  over the existing structure  which can increase the appeal of the building and its resale value  9 
glazing
 semi transparent modules can be used to replace a number of architectural elements commonly made with glass or similar materials  such as windows and skylights 
what is bipv 
three main types of bipv products
crystalline silicon solar panels for ground-based and rooftop power plant
amorphous crystalline silicon thin film solar pv modules which could be hollow  light  red blue yellow  as glass curtain wall and transparent skylight 
double glasses solar panels with square cells inside 
recently  in 2011-2016   australian researchers have been working on developing the new approaches to implementing the unconventional bipv systems and technologies  including solar photovoltaic windows of high visible transparency capable of providing significant energy savings  10  due to superior thermal insulation properties and solar radiation control  significant electric energy outputs were obtained from installation-ready framed pv window systems  as documented in  11 
transparent and translucent photovoltaics edit 
transparent solar panels use a tin oxide coating on the inner surface of the glass panes to conduct current out of the cell  the cell contains titanium oxide that is coated with a photoelectric dye  12 
most conventional solar cells use visible and infrared light to generate electricity  in contrast  the innovative new solar cell also uses ultraviolet radiation  used to replace conventional window glass  or placed over the glass  the installation surface area could be large  leading to potential uses that take advantage of the combined functions of power generation  lighting and temperature control  citation needed 
another name for transparent photovoltaics is translucent photovoltaics  they transmit half the light that falls on them   similar to inorganic photovoltaics  organic photovoltaics are also capable of being translucent 
government subsidies edit 
see also  pv financial incentives
in some countries  additional incentives  or subsidies  are offered for building-integrated photovoltaics in addition to the existing feed-in tariffs for stand-alone solar systems  since july 2006 france offered the highest incentive for bipv  equal to an extra premium of eur 0.25 kwh paid in addition to the 30 euro cents for pv systems  13  14  15  these incentives are offered in the form of a rate paid for electricity fed to the grid 
european union edit 
france 0.25 kwh 14 
germany 0.05 kwh facade bonus expired in 2009

china edit 
further to the announcement of a subsidy program for bipv projects in march 2009 offering rmb20 per watt for bipv systems and rmb15 watt for rooftop systems  the chinese government recently unveiled a photovoltaic energy subsidy program the golden sun demonstration project  the subsidy program aims at supporting the development of photovoltaic electricity generation ventures and the commercialization of pv technology  the ministry of finance  the ministry of science and technology and the national energy bureau have jointly announced the details of the program in july 2009  17  qualified on-grid photovoltaic electricity generation projects including rooftop  bipv  and ground mounted systems are entitled to receive a subsidy equal to 50  of the total investment of each project  including associated transmission infrastructure  qualified off-grid independent projects in remote areas will be eligible for subsidies of up to 70  of the total investment  18  in mid november  chinas finance ministry has selected 294 projects totaling 642 megawatts that come to roughly rmb 20 billion   3 billion  in costs for its subsidy plan to dramatically boost the countrys solar energy production  19 
other integrated photovoltaics edit 
vehicle-integrated photovoltaics  vipv  are similar for vehicles  20  solar cells could be embedded into panels exposed to sunlight such as the hood  roof and possibly the trunk depending on a car s design  21  22  23  24
