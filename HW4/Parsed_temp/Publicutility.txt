united states edit 
in the united states  public utilities are often natural monopolies because the infrastructure required to produce and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain  6  as a result  they are often government monopolies  or if privately owned  the sectors are specially regulated by a public utilities commission  1  2  3  the first public utility in the united states was a grist mill on mother brook in dedham  massachusetts  7 
developments in technology have eroded some of the natural monopoly aspects of traditional public utilities  for instance  electricity generation  electricity retailing  telecommunication  some types of public transit and postal services have become competitive in some countries and the trend towards liberalization  deregulation and privatization of public utilities is growing  but the network infrastructure used to distribute most utility products and services has remained largely monopolistic 
public utilities can be privately owned or publicly owned  publicly owned utilities include cooperative and municipal utilities  municipal utilities may actually include territories outside of city limits or may not even serve the entire city  cooperative utilities are owned by the customers they serve  they are usually found in rural areas  publicly owned utilities are non-profit  private utilities  also called investor-owned utilities  are owned by investors  8  9  10  and operate for profit  often referred to as a rate of return 
public utilities provide services at the consumer level  be it residential  commercial  or industrial consumer  in turn  utilities and very large consumers buy and sell electricity at the wholesale level through a network of rtos and isos within one of three grids  the eastern grid  texas  which is a single iso  and the western grid 
the california public utilities commission edit 
the california public utilities commission  or cpuc  is a public utilities commission that officially regulates the privately owned electric  natural gas  telecommunications  water  railroad  rail transit  and passenger transportation companies that operate in the state of california  4 
united kingdom and ireland edit 
in the united kingdom and ireland  the state  private firms  and charities ran the traditional public utilities  for instance  the sanitary districts were established in england and wales in 1875 and in ireland in 1878 
the term can refer to the set of services provided by various organizations that are used in everyday life by the public  such as  electricity generation  electricity retailing  electricity supplies  natural gas supplies  water supplies  sewage works  sewage systems and broadband internet services  11  they are regulated by ofgem  ofwat and ofcom  disabled community transport services may occasionally be included within the definition  they were mostly privatised in the uk during the 1980s
