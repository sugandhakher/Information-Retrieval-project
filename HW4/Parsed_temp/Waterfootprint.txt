water use can mean the amount of water used by a household or a country  or the amount used for a given task or for the production of a given quantity of some product or crop  or the amount allocated for a particular purpose 
globally  of precipitation falling on land each year  about 117,000km3  28,000cumi    1  about 4 percent is used by rainfed agriculture and about half is subject to evaporation and transpiration in forests and other natural or quasi-natural landscapes  2  the remainder  which goes to groundwater replenishment and surface runoff  is sometimes called total actual renewable freshwater resources  its magnitude was recently estimated at 52,579km3  12,614cumi  year  3  it represents water that can be used either instream or after withdrawal from surface and groundwater sources  of this remainder  about 3,918km3 were withdrawn in 2007  of which 2,722km3  69 percent  were used by agriculture  and 734km3  19 percent  by other industry  4  most agricultural use of withdrawn water is for irrigation  which uses about 5.1 percent of total actual renewable freshwater resources  3  world water use has been growing rapidly in the last hundred years  see graph from new scientist article 5   
there are numerous measures of water use  including total water use  drinking water consumption  non-consumptive use  withdrawn water use  from surface and groundwater sources   instream use  water footprint  etc  each of these  and other  measures of water use is appropriate for some purposes and inappropriate for others  water footprints have become popular measures of use  e g  in relation to personal consumption  the term  water footprint  is often used to refer to the amount of water used by an individual  community  business  or nation  or the amount of water use associated with  although not necessarily assignable to  a product 
the total water footprint of a typical 3-person household in the u s  is 23,360l  5,140impgal  6,170usgal   6  by comparison  a typical single family home in the u s  only uses about 262l  58impgal  69usgal  of water per day  2008 estimate   this includes  in decreasing order  toilet use  washing machine use  showers  baths  faucet use  and leaks  7  bettersourceneeded

water footprint edit 
the water footprint of an individual  community or business is defined as the total volume of freshwater used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business  water use is measured in water volume consumed  evaporated  and or polluted per unit of time  a water footprint can be calculated for any well-defined group of consumers  e g   an individual  family  village  city  province  state or nation  or producers  e g   a public organization  private enterprise or economic sector   the water footprint is a geographically explicit indicator  not only showing volumes of water use and pollution  but also the locations  8  9 
the water footprint of a country is related to what its people eat  for example  it is a common thought that the water involved in a cup of coffee is just the water in the cup  9  there is actually 140 litres of water involved  the 140 litres of water is the amount of water that was used to grow  produce  package  and ship the coffee beans  9  a hamburger needs an estimated 2,400 litres of water  this hidden water is technically called virtual water  9  therefore  eating a lot of meat means a large water footprint  however  care is needed to avoid misunderstanding the significance of water footprints of food   see  water footprint of products   below  
history edit 
the water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by arjen y  hoekstra from unesco-ihe as an alternative indicator of water use  10  water footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators  which also includes carbon footprint and land footprint  the water footprint concept is further related to the idea of virtual water trade introduced by professor john allan  2008 stockholm water prize laureate   the most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004 report on the  water footprint of nations  from unesco-ihe  11  and the 2008 book globalization of water  12  and the 2011 manual the water footprint assessment manual  setting the global standard  13  cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the water footprint network in 2008 that aims to coordinate efforts to further develop and disseminate knowledge on water footprint concepts  methods and tools 
water footprint network  wfn  edit 
the water footprint network is an international learning community  non-profit foundation under dutch law  that serves as a platform for connecting communities interested in sustainability  equitability and efficiency of water use  the organization has two work programmes  a technical work programme and a policy work programme  in addition  there is a partner forum which offer partners of the wfn a way of receiving  contributing and exchanging knowledge and experience on water footprint  its mission and activities are listed below and taken directly from the water footprint website  14 
blue water footprint edit 
the blue water footprint is the volume of freshwater that evaporated from the global blue water resources  surface water and ground water  to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community  either lost through evapotranspiration  incorporated in products or transferred to non-blue catchments  
green water footprint edit 
the green water footprint is the volume of water evaporated from the global green water resources  rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture  during production or those incorporated in products 
grey water footprint edit 
the grey water footprint is the volume of polluted water that associates with the production of all goods and services for the individual or community  the latter can be estimated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the water remains at or above agreed water quality standards  it is calculated as

where l is the pollutant load  as mass flux   cmax the maximum allowable concentration and cnat the natural concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water body  both expressed in mass volume   15 
sustainable water use edit 
sustainable water use involves the rigorous assessment of all source of clean water to establish the current and future rates of use  the impacts of that use both downstream and in the wider area where the water may be used and the impact of contaminated water streams on the environment and economic well being of the area  it also involves the implementation of social policies such as water pricing in order to manage water demand  16  in some localities  water may also have spiritual relevance and the use of such water may need to take account of such interests  for example  the maori believe that water is the source and foundation of all life and have many spiritual associations with water and places associated with water  17  on a national and global scale  water sustainability requires strategic and long term planning to ensure appropriate sources of clean water are identified and the environmental and economic impact of such choices are understood and accepted  18  the re-use and reclamation of water is also part of sustainability including downstream impacts on both surface waters and ground waters  19 
calculation for different actors edit 
the water footprint of a process is expressed as volumetric flow rate of water  that of a product is the whole footprint  sum  of processes in its complete supply chain divided by the number of product units  for consumers  businesses and geographic area  water footprint is indicated as volume of water per time  in particular  15 
that of a consumer is the sum of footprint of all consumed products 
that of a community or a nation is the sum for all of its members resp  inhabitants 
that of a business is the footprint of all produced goods 
that of a geographically delineated area is the footprint of all processes undertaken in this area  the virtual water balance of an area is the net import of virtual water vi  net  defined as the difference of the gross import vi of virtual water from its gross export ve  the water footprint of national consumption wfarea nat results from this as the sum of the water footprint of national area and its virtual water balance 
international standard edit 
in february 2011  the water footprint network  in a global collaborative effort of environmental organizations  companies  research institutions and the un  launched the global water footprint standard  on july 24  2014  iso issued iso 14046 2014  environmental managementwater footprintprinciples  requirements and guidelines   4  the iso standard is based on life cycle assessment  lca  principles and can be applied for different sorts of assessment of products and companies 
life cycle analysis of water use edit 
life cycle analysis  lca  is a systematic  phased approach to assessing the environmental aspects and potential impacts that are associated with a product  process or service  life cycle refers to the major activities in the course of the products life-span from its manufacture  use  and maintenance  to its final disposal  including the raw material acquisition required to manufacture the product  20  thus a method for assessing the environmental impacts of freshwater consumption was developed  it specifically looks at the damage to three areas of protection  human health  ecosystem quality  and resources  the consideration of water consumption is crucial where water-intensive products  for example agricultural goods  are concerned and need to therefore undergo a life-cycle assessment  21  in addition  regional assessments are equally as necessary as the impact of water use depends on its location  in short  lca is important as it identifies the impact of water use in certain products  consumers  companies  nations  etc  which can help reduce the amount of water used 
water footprint of products edit 
the water footprint of a product is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the product  summed over the various steps of the production chain  the water footprint of a product refers not only to the total volume of water used  it also refers to where and when the water is used  source  wfn glossary   the water footprint network maintains a global database on the water footprint of products  waterstat
the water footprints involved in various diets vary greatly  and much of the variation tends to be associated with levels of meat consumption  22  the following table gives some examples of estimated global average water footprints of some agricultural products  23  24

water footprint of individual consumers edit 
the water footprint of an individual refers to the sum of his or her direct and indirect freshwater use  the direct water use is the water used at home  while the indirect water use relates to the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed 
the average global water footprint of an individual is 1,385 m3 per year  residents in some example nations have a water footprints as shown in the table

water footprint of companies edit 
the water footprint of a business  the  corporate water footprint   is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used directly or indirectly to run and support a business  it is the total volume of water use to be associated with the use of the business outputs  the water footprint of a business consists of water used for producing manufacturing or for supporting activities and the indirect water use in the producers supply chain 
the carbon trust argue that a more robust approach is for businesses to go beyond simple volumetric measurement to assess the full range of water impact from all sites  its work with leading global pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline  gsk  analysed four key categories  water availability  water quality  health impacts  and licence to operate  including reputational and regulatory risks  in order to enable gsk to quantitatively measure  and credibly reduce  its year-on-year water impact  29 
the coca-cola company operates over a thousand manufacturing plants in about 200 countries  making its drink uses a lot of water  critics say its water footprint has been large  coca-cola has started to look at its water sustainability  30  it has now set out goals to reduce its water footprint such as treating the water it uses so it goes back into the environment in a clean state  another goal is to find sustainable sources for the raw materials it uses in its drinks  such as sugarcane  oranges  and corn  by making its water footprint better  the company can reduce costs  improve the environment  and benefit the communities in which it operates  19 
water footprint of nations edit 
the water footprint of a nation is the water used to produce the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of the nation  the internal water footprint is the appropriation of domestic water resources  the external water footprint is the appropriation of water resources in other countries  about 65  of japan s total water footprint comes from outside the country  about 7  of the chinese water footprint falls outside china  9 
europe edit 
see also  category droughts in europe
each eu citizen consumes 4,815 litres of water per day on average  44  is used in power production primarily to cool thermal plants or nuclear power plants  energy production annual water consumption in the eu 27 in 2011 was as billion m3 for gas 0.53  coal 1.54 and nuclear 2.44  wind energy avoided the use of 387 million cubic metres  mn m  of water in 2012 avoiding a cost of 743 mn  the cost of droughts in europe over the past thirty years is according to the european commission 100 billion  31  32 
criticism of water footprint and virtual water edit 
insufficient consideration of consequences of proposed water saving policies to farm households edit 
according to dennis wichelns of the international water management institute  although one goal of virtual water analysis is to describe opportunities for improving water security  there is almost no mention of the potential impacts of the prescriptions arising from that analysis on farm households in industrialized or developing countries  it is essential to consider more carefully the inherent flaws in the virtual water and water footprint perspectives  particularly when seeking guidance regarding policy decisions  33 
insufficient consideration of regional water scarcity edit 
the application and interpretation of water footprints may sometimes be used to promote industrial activities that lead to facile criticism of certain products  for example  the 140 litres required for coffee production for one cup 9  might be of no harm to water resources if its cultivation occurs mainly in humid areas  but could be damaging in more arid regions  other factors such as hydrology  climate  geology  topography  population and demographics should also be taken into account  nevertheless  high water footprint calculations do suggest that environmental concern may be appropriate 
the use of the term  footprint  can also confuse people familiar with the notion of a carbon footprint  because the water footprint concept includes sums of water quantities without necessarily evaluating related impacts  this is in contrast to the carbon footprint  where carbon emissions are not simply summarized but normalized by co2 emissions  which are globally identical  to account for the environmental harm  the difference is due to the somewhat more complex nature of water  while involved in the global hydrological cycle  it is expressed in conditions both local and regional through various forms like river basins  watersheds  on down to groundwater  as part of larger aquifer systems  
the water footprint of a business  the  corporate water footprint   is defined as the total volume of fresh water that is used directly or indirectly to run and support a business  it is the total volume of water use to be associated with the use of the business outputs  the water footprint of a business consists of water used for producing manufacturing or for supporting activities and the indirect water use in the producers supply chain  water credit for conserving water  nagpur based innovator shripad vaidya s idea of giving water credit s  much like carbon credits  to those who save and conserve water is gaining ground  these water credits can be marketed or sold to those in need of surplus water for social agricultural or industrial ventures  34  35  36 
environmental water use edit 
although agricultures water use includes provision of important terrestrial environmental values  as discussed in the water footprint of products section above   and much green water is used in maintaining forests and wild lands  there is also direct environmental use  e g  of surface water  that may be allocated by governments  for example  in california  where water use issues are sometimes severe because of drought  about 48 percent of dedicated water use in an average water year is for the environment  somewhat more than for agriculture   37  such environmental water use is for keeping streams flowing  maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats  keeping wetlands wet  etc 
sectoral distributions of withdrawn water use edit 
several nations estimate sectoral distribution of use of water withdrawn from surface and groundwater sources  for example  in canada  in 2005  42 billion cu  m of withdrawn water were used  of which about 38 billion cu  m was freshwater  distribution of this use among sectors was  thermoelectric power generation 66.2   manufacturing 13.6   residential 9.0   agriculture 4.7   commercial and institutional 2.7   water treatment and distribution systems 2.3   mining 1.1   and oil and gas extraction 0.5   the 38 billion cu m of freshwater withdrawn in that year can be compared with the nations annual freshwater yield  estimated as streamflow  of 3,472 billion cu m  38  sectoral distribution is different in many respects in the us  where agriculture accounts for about 39  of fresh water withdrawals  thermoelectric power generation 38   industrial 4   residential 1   and mining  including oil and gas  1   39 
within the agricultural sector  withdrawn water use is for irrigation and for livestock  whereas all irrigation in the us  including loss in conveyance of irrigation water  is estimated to account for about 38 percent of us withdrawn freshwater use  39  the irrigation water used for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9 percent  40  and other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector  for drinking  washdown of facilities  etc   is estimated at about 0.7 percent  39  because agriculture is a major user of withdrawn water  changes in the magnitude and efficiency of its water use are important  in the us  from 1980  when agricultures withdrawn water use peaked  to 2010  there was a 23 percent reduction in agricultures use of withdrawn water  39  while us agricultural output increased by 49 percent over that period  41 
in the us  irrigation water application data are collected in the quintennial farm and ranch irrigation survey  conducted as part of the census of agriculture  such data indicate great differences in irrigation water use within various agricultural sectors  for example  about 14 percent of corn-for-grain land and 11 percent of soybean land in the us are irrigated  compared with 66 percent of vegetable land  79 percent of orchard land and 97 percent of rice land  42  43
