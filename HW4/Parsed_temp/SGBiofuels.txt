company history and overview edit 
sg biofuels  sgb  is a fully integrated bioenergy crop company using molecular breeding and biotechnology to develop and produce elite hybrid seeds of jatropha as a low-cost feedstock for biodiesel  bio jet fuel  and specialty chemicals

jatropha cultivation  research and sgb history edit 
sg biofuels grows jatropha in greenhouses and on plantations in latin and central america for sustainable biofuel production and researches methods with which to optimize the jatropha seeds and growing processes  jatropha has been growing successfully in tropical and subtropical locations for many years and has been cited as one of the best candidates for biodiesel production because of its high oil content30 to 40 percent  2 
the company s research focuses on the domestication and genetic improvement of jatropha  areas of focus include increasing oil content per seed  increasing number of seeds per plant  improving flowering synchronicity  and improving pest and disease resistance  the company also researches strains that can sustain colder temperatures for growth in the u s  2 
the company s jatropha research and development center has the world s largest and most diverse collection of jatropha genetic material  3  the company s website states that its germplasm library holds over 12,000 unique jatropha genotypes  preliminary molecular marker studies indicate that sg biofuels  jatropha germplasm collection exhibits on the order of 5 times the genetic diversity observed in a collection of jatropha from india  africa  and asia  4 
in march 2010  sg biofuels launched its first jmax100 cultivar  a proprietary cultivar of jatropha optimized for growing conditions in guatemala with yields averaging approximately 100 percent greater than existing varieties  5 
in august 2010  sg biofuels and life technologies announced that they had completed the genome sequencing of jatropha  6 
in august 2011  sg biofuels  sgb  initiated a program with bharat renewable energy ltd  brel   a joint-venture of bharat petroleum  indias second largest petroleum company  to develop and deploy elite hybrids of jatropha for the production of biodiesel in india  7
