the wayback machine is a digital archive of the world wide web and other information on the internet created by the internet archive  a nonprofit organization  based in san francisco  california  united states  the internet archive launched the wayback machine in october 2001  4  5  it was set up by brewster kahle and bruce gilliat  and is maintained with content from alexa internet  the service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time  which the archive calls a  three dimensional index  
since 1996  the wayback machine has been archiving cached pages of websites onto its large cluster of linux nodes  it revisits sites every few weeks or months and archives a new version  sites can also be captured on the fly by visitors who enter the site s url into a search box  the intent is to capture and archive content that otherwise would be lost whenever a site is changed or closed down  the grand vision of the machine s creators is to archive the entire internet  6 
the name wayback machine was chosen as a droll reference to a plot device in an animated cartoon  the rocky and bullwinkle show  in one of the animated cartoon s component segments  peabody s improbable history  lead characters mr  peabody and sherman routinely used a time machine called the  wabac machine   pronounced way-back  to witness  participate in  and  more often than not  alter famous events in history  7  8

history edit 
origins edit 
in 1996 brewster kahle  with bruce gilliat  developed software to crawl and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages  the gopher hierarchy  the netnews  usenet  bulletin board system  and downloadable software  9  the information collected by these  crawlers  does not include all the information available on the internet  since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible  these  crawlers  also respect the robots exclusion standard for websites whose owners opt for them not to appear in search results or be cached  to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites  archive-it org was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content  and create digital archives 
information had been kept on digital tape for five years  with kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database  10  when the archive reached its fifth anniversary  it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the university of california  berkeley 
snapshots usually become available more than six months after they are archived or  in some cases  even later  it can take twenty-four months or longer  11  the frequency of snapshots is variable  so not all tracked website updates are recorded  sometimes there are intervals of several weeks or years between snapshots 
after august 2008 sites had to be listed on the open directory in order to be included  12  according to jeff kaplan of the internet archive in november 2010  other sites were still being archived  13  but more recent captures would become visible only after the next major indexing  an infrequent operation 
storage capabilities edit 
as of 2009 update   the wayback machine contained approximately three petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of 100 terabytes each month  14  the growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytes month  the data is stored on petabox rack systems manufactured by capricorn technologies  15 
in 2009  the internet archive migrated its customized storage architecture to sun open storage  and hosts a new data center in a sun modular datacenter on sun microsystems  california campus  16 
in 2011 a new  improved version of the wayback machine  with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content  was made available for public testing  17 
in march 2011  it was said on the wayback machine forum that  the beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and up-to-date index of all crawled materials into 2010  and will continue to be updated regularly  the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008  and no further index updates are planned  as it will be phased out this year   18 
in january 2013  the company announced a ground-breaking milestone of 240 billion urls  19 
in october 2013  the company announced the  save a page  feature 20  which allows any internet user to archive the contents of a url  this became a threat of abuse by the service for hosting malicious binaries  21  22 
as of december 2014 update   the wayback machine contained almost nine petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of about 20 terabytes each week  23 
growth edit 
between october 2013 and march 2015 the website s global alexa rank changed from 162 24  to 208  25

use in legal evidence edit 
civil litigation edit 
netbula llc v  chordiant software inc  edit 
in a 2009 case  netbula  llc v  chordiant software inc   defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robots txt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbula s site  pages that chordiant believed would support its case  37 
netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbula s website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly  38  an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiant s motion  however  stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means  without considerable burden  expense and disruption to its operations   37 
magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california  san jose division  rejected netbula s arguments and ordered them to disable the robots txt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought  37 
telewizja polska edit 
in an october 2004 case  telewizja polska usa  inc  v  echostar satellite  no  02 c 3293  65 fed  r  evid  serv  673  n d  ill  oct  15  2004   a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence  perhaps for the first time  telewizja polska is the provider of tvp polonia and echostar operates the dish network  prior to the trial proceedings  echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polska s website  telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source  but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polska s assertion of hearsay and denied tvp s motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial  39  40  at the trial  however  district court judge ronald guzman  the trial judge  overruled magistrate keys  findings  citation needed  and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages  i e   the telewizja polska website  were admissible as evidence  judge guzman reasoned that the employee s affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements  and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating  citation needed 
patent law edit 
main article  internet as a source of prior art
provided some additional requirements are met  e g  providing an authoritative statement of the archivist   the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public  these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application  41 
limitations of utility edit 
there are technical limitations to archiving a website  and as a consequence  it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives  this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints  answers  or expert witness reports  when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore  can contain errors  for example  archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore  do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives  42 
legal status edit 
in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws  only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated  so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator  43  the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site  the wayback machine also retroactively respects robots txt files  i e   pages that currently are blocked to robots on the live web temporarily will be made unavailable from the archives as well 
archived content legal issues edit 
a number of cases have been brought against the internet archive specifically for its wayback machine archiving efforts 
scientology edit 
see also  scientology and the internet
in late 2002  the internet archive removed various sites that were critical of scientology from the wayback machine  44  an error message stated that this was in response to a  request by the site owner   45  later  it was clarified that lawyers from the church of scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed  46 
healthcare advocates  inc  edit 
in 2003  harding earley follmer   frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archive s wayback machine  the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid  based on the content of their website from several years prior  the plaintiff  healthcare advocates  then amended their complaint to include the internet archive  accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act  healthcare advocates claimed that  since they had installed a robots txt file on their website  even if after the initial lawsuit was filed  the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine  47  the lawsuit was settled out of court  48 
robots txt is used as part of the robots exclusion standard  a voluntary protocol the internet archive respects that disallows bots from indexing certain pages delineated by its creator as off-limits  as a result  the internet archive has rendered unavailable a number of websites that now are inaccessible through the wayback machine  currently  the internet archive applies robots txt rules retroactively  if a site blocks the internet archive  such as healthcare advocates  any previously archived pages from the domain are rendered unavailable as well  in cases of blocked sites  only the robots txt file is archived 
the internet archive states  however   sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site  we comply with these requests   49  in addition  the website says   the internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection   50 
suzanne shell edit 
in december 2005  activist suzanne shell filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us  100,000 for archiving her website profane-justice org between 1999 and 2004  51  52  internet archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california on january 20  2006  seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shell s copyright  shell responded and brought a countersuit against internet archive for archiving her site  which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service  53  on february 13  2007  a judge for the united states district court for the district of colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract  52  the internet archive did not move to dismiss copyright infringement claims shell asserted arising out of its copying activities  which would also go forward  54 
on april 25  2007  internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit  51  the internet archive said it     has no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived  we recognize that ms  shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation   shell said   i respect the historical value of internet archive s goal  i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm   55 
daniel davydiuk edit 
in 201314 a pornographic actor was trying to remove archived images of himself  first by sending multiple dmca requests to the archive and then in the federal court of canada  56  57 
search engine links edit 
in 2005  yahoo  search began to provide links to other versions of pages archived on the wayback machine  58
