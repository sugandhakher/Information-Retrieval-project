Homework 2- readme.txt

The page rank algorithm has been created in Python 2.7
In order to run the file ensure Python 2.7 is there on the ystem.
Download the HW2 folder in the system.

Task3.txt

To run the page rank for G1 execute the dictionary.py file in G1 folder in Source-code and then execute the
PageRank-G1.py file.
To execute the page rank for G2 run the dictionary.py file in G2 folder in Source-code and then execute the
PageRank-G2.py file

The PageRank-G1 and PageRank-G2 files provide the code to calculate the page ranks for the graphs G1 and G2
respectively. The page rank algorithm has been implemented in these codes.
Calculating the perplexity and entropy the page rank values has been converged where perplexity	is
simply 2 raised to the (Shannon) entropy of	the	PageRank distribution, i.e., 2^H (PR).

In Task1 the pages with no inlinks and pages with no outlinks in both G1 and G2 are given in the text files.
Also description.txt file gives the brief statistics of the proportion of pages with no inlinks and no outlinks.

Task2 provides the text files with top 50 page rank values for both G1 and G2. Also it has the text files
for the perplexity values calculated for both G1 and G2 for their respective loops.

In Task3 there is a brief speculation given about the page rank.
The pages with maximum inlinks in both the graphs are compared with pages with highest page ranks and it is
deduced that page rank does not completely dependent on the maximum number of inlinks for that page.
