We observe that the top 2 links in G2 with maximum number of inlinks is the same as top 2 links in
pages with top ranks in G2, whereas page with second top most page-rank in G1 has maximum number of inlinks in G1.
Hence we can deduce that the page rank does not depend on the number of inlinks that the page has.

Page with high ranks does not totally depend on the maximum of inlinks but also depend on the number of outlinks
going from those inlinks. Also if a page with high page rank points to any page, the page rank of the later
also increases.
In G1 and G2 pages with high page ranks is due to the fact that they have aself referential links.
